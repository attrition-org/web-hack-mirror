	<center><u><b>Fuel protestors to strike again in 60 days</b></u><br><br></center>
	</font>
	Due to the recent announcement by the British government that it will not, under any circumstances, bow to public opinion
	and alter tax policy, it looks increasingly likely that the protests will be re-started again in two months time.<br><br>
	
	This foolhardy statement, issued with great sincerity by our leaders, means they have backed themselves into a very tight
	corner. It would appear that they want please all the people all the time: on one hand saying that they are willing to 
	listen to any grievances, on the other hand saying they will take no action on the matter. How can they explain the apparent
	hypocrisy of such contradictory statements? The short answer would appear to be "they can't". In other words, nothing will
	be resolved and we are certain to be facing an even bigger and better organised protest next time around.<Br><br><br>

	<center><u><b>Protests, hacktivism and YOU</b></u><br><br></center>
	</font>
	
	If it comes to pass that the government does indeed take no action on the fuel tax issue, it is intended that the protestors will
	again take to the roads on slow-drives and barricade the oil depots. Further to this, in a seperately organised campaign, 
	high-profile websites are going to be targetted by hackers in a "hacktivist" protest. By targeting financial, stock-market, 
	e-commerce and government internet installations, the online hacktivist protest aims to disrupt the UK's big-money companies and
	hit politicians and fat-cats where it hurts: the wallet. These protests will run simultaneously with the lorry blockades and will be
	ongoing throughout the protest.<br><BR>
	
	So far, most website intrusions have been kept low-key by both hackers and big-business. This will change with the start of the fuel
	protest hacktivism, as there has never before been a concerted effort by the hacker community to systematically take out large
	corporate money-making machines. As everyone knows, the internet is an inherantly insecure place but remains fairly stable due to
	the slap-dash methods of hacking. Now, however, there is enough brain-power and technological sophistication available to plan and
	execute a devastating attack on internet enabled business; this is what is happening now, as you read this. Companies are being
	scanned, backdoors put in place, weaknesses noted and vulnerable networks recorded for future hacktivist penetration.<br><br>
	
	Hacker groups and lone-hackers alike are encouranged to take up this challenge; to work together; to organise their own protests in
	an effort to add redundancy to the hacktivist effort. A distributed hacker network can be put in place very easily in two months, and
	if conducted properly, can greatly enhance to the effectiveness of the fuel tax protest as a whole.<br><br><br>

	<center><u><b>Things to keep in mind</b></u><br><br></center>
	</font>
	
	Having stated all of the above, lets keep our heads about the issue. Some things should be kept in mind:<br>
	<ul>
		Don't hack charity or small-business websites. You should know why not.<br>
		Don't delete data. This is not the spirit of hacktivism, and is tantamount to destruction of property.<br>
		Try to target widely used or very profitable sites. Things like the stock exchange are ideal.<br>
		Try to make sure it is very easy to see why the hacked sites have been hacked.<br>
		Try (without doing any permanent damage) to make the hack "stick" as long as possible.<br>
		Don't steal confidential information for any purposes. This is a protest, not espionage.<br>
		Check your hacks for spelling and grammar. Dum speeling missstakes stewpid look.<br>
