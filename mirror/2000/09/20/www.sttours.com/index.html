Erm, ok, I am starting to have a major fuckin issue with some things in
life... WTF is up with kids bringing guns to school? You know there for a
while I thoguht it was like a trend, you know, grab your dads gun from your
house, and go hunting at school, fire off a couple shots, then everyone sees
that you were probley mistreated as a child, but now... You don't hear about
it that much anymore, until today I was driveing in my car at work, and I
was listening to the raido. What do you know, I hear about an 8th grader
takeing a gun to school firing off a few shots, not hitting anyone with it.
Damn, do we have issues or what. This shit needs to come to an end, and So I
kept listening a lil more, They held a parent meeting on this, and what do
you know... about 60 parents cared enought to show up... What the fuck, this
school has about 3,000 students in it or so... And only 50 perents gave a
fuckin damn to come and talk about it and try and find an answer??? Well,
that right there is an issue...

You know looking back on some of the pics and defaced sites about what happened in some of these schools where shootings did happen, are we going to have to wait till something like that happens in my home town befor we get off our fat fuckin asses to do something about it, wait till lifes are taken, wait till some of our youth is dead, wiat till familys are torn apart... Is that what we will have to wait till to come up with an answer?<br>
