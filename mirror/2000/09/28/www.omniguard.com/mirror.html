#HACKER<font color="white">::<font color="black">I CANT STAND IT ANYMORE. These lame assholes come into this chan EVERY DAY and spam everyone for help with HOTMAIL hacking or SUB7 HELP. Heres my advice to these lamers - READ. Don't expect everyone to hack stuff for you, or even explain how something works thats as lame as sub7. 
<BR><BR>
<font color="gray">ADM<font color="white">::<font color="black">WORD! I give much love to you for what your trying to do. Crippling your code is a pretty cool idea. It makes the average novice hacker actually READ the source code and see how it works. Sure the code isnt majorly damaged, but its enough that you need to know a little before you can use it. Keep up the good work!<BR><BR>
