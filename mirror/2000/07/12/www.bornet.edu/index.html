<br><br><h4>I just wanted to wish [tNc] a happy b-day. Much klown luv to
everyone else out there. Technology is changing and we are changing with it.
We do not want to harm, we just want to help secure. You leave your doors unlocked
and we will walk in your house and lock them for you. That is what we are here 
for. No no no..there is no need to fear us because we are only your friendly
neighbors and we want to help our community. We are the d0od0o krew. And yes, we
are the shit.<br><br><br>


<h5>Stand by your friends, whether it be wrong or right. You single out and 
attack the ones who have no defense. You call that a new way of thinking? 
I call it regression to ignorance. Take warning, there is a new generation 
coming, and we really need to stand up to those nobodys. Unless you have 
something to prove, we do not want a set of standards, we do not need a new 
set of rules. I have heard all of that shit before about stomping out any 
difference. We say stand together, not to fight but just to exist, and take 
warning. Their intimidation is coming, as it always has, and we really need 
to say no to them. Enough is enough is enough. Why don't you just ease up? 
I saw another beat down last night. Take warning. Who is the next to hit the 
ground tonight? Take warning. <h5>
