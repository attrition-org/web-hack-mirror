    loll'z hacker crew.</font></small></strong><p align="justify"><small><font face="Arial">This
    is a multi-site hack, and thoze lame serverz are running on Microsoft IIS.<br>
    We think that the net should be more secure and this thought can be reached if thoze
    m1cr0$0fT softwarez won't be used on webservers, cuz you can't use them to protect your
    server. Yeah, I know, they are easy to use, but excuse me, windoze is for single users,
    not for webservers. The microsuxx programz are backdoored and bugged enough, so that any
    single windoze user can defeace them.</font></small></p>
    <p align="justify"><small><font face="Arial">Now some words about theze sitez:<br>
    <a href="index.html">www.bsa.cz</a> - this is the czech (or what) affiliate of the
    buZiness software alliance, I hate thoze motherfuckerz, who come to people's place and...
    but everyone knows about the ritue of this ssss******</font></small></p>
    <p align="justify"><small><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.siofok.hu">www.siofok.hu</a>
    - this is a hungarian city, by lake balaton, I've just spent a week there, cool place, but
    lame webserver...</font></small></p>
    <p align="justify"><small><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.infoteka.hu">www.infoteka.hu</a>
    - hacked again.and again. This webmaster is a real lame one. This site wuz hacked by us
    for the third time. Thanx for the lameness. Oh, and another thing realated to this site:
    this is not the lameness of the euroweb webmaster, this is a co-located server, so don't
    piss the euroweb root for this hack.</font></small></p>
    <p align="justify"><small><font face="Arial">And again - these sitez were hacked by a
    hungarian hacker crew, loll'z. hack by: obotak [ yo mail-me at: <a
