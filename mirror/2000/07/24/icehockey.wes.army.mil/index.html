<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0">The Indian security forces in Kashmir have systematically violated the Code of Medical Neutrality in Armed Conflict. During the curfew the security forces have prevented medical personnel from evacuating injured people in need of treatment. Ambulance drivers have been the principal victims of these actions, frequently being stopped while on duty. A number have been fired on and beaten, in some cases the medical personnel have been detained, tortured and killed.</font><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0">Torture is widely practiced in Kashmir as a means of extracting information from detainees, coercing confessions, punishing persons believed sympathetic to the militants and creating a climate of political repression. Torture includes severe methods, which include the psycho-torture: soldiers rape the detainee's wife in front of his eyes.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0"> <BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0">Patrols downtown. Military squads in the streets, they are looking for militants. 01 Minute to evacuate their homes. Time limit expired. The soldiers enter, bursts of gun fire. Entire families slaughtered. Flesh burned five, ten, fifteen bodies bleeding now while I am writing far away from Kashmir.</FONT> </P>

<P>Here are some facts of Kashmir.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" COLOR="#c0c0c0"><P>It is high time to sort this issue out for the following reasons: </P>
<P>Over 50,000 Kashmiri's have been killed since 1990.</P>
<P>Over 1,000 Indian army people have been killed since 1990. </P>
<P>Its time India lived up to its promises. </P>
<P>The whole of South Asia is unstable due to this problem, especially now that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers. </P>
<P>Two great nations namely Pakistan and India have to spend enormous amount of money on their armed forces because of this problem. </P>
<P>When India and Pakistan takes 5 steps forward the Kashmir issue takes them back 6 steps. </P>
<P>There has never been a better time to sort this problem. The cold war has ended, we are at the dawn of the 21st century and the potential consequences of not sorting it out are two high to contemplate. </P>
<P>Neither Pakistan, India nor Kashmir will win in the war, especially if it goes nuclear.</P></FONT>
