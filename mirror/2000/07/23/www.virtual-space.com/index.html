<font color="red">*sigh* Admin your security has been comprised.<br>
Nothing on your system has been damaged and i have patched the hole
through which i broke in. All you have to do is mv indexbak.html
index.html. Don't bother saying this hack cost your company any ca$h
:)</font>
<hr>
I recently have read the article on antionline "how to be a hacker
profiler".<br>
This article has been on antionline.com for quite some time now<br>
and i suggest that if you havent read it yet to go and do so right
away.<br>
The article shows just how easy it is for the fbi to find you<br>
 by just knowing your handle and/or the group you are in.<br>
<br>
It's kind of scary to be honest. Some of you<br>
out there right now are probably saying "heh listen to this fag".<br>
Well i think that you are the people that will get caught hacking<br>
I honestly think that there isn't one person out there now who has defaced<br>
a site that isn't scared about getting busted for it.<br>
<br>
"This all adds to the effect" some say. "This is why defacers do it".<br>
Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but remember this:<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">People who were way more talented than you are have gotten caught<br>
 for the same crimes. What stops you from being caught?</font><br>
<br>
Fair enough you can delete your tracks, we all know that's<br>
 not hard to do. But that's not how crackers have gotten caught
defacing.<br>
<br>
Just because you can delete your tracks doesn't<br>
mean you are safe. You chat on irc right?<br>
And you use the same nick in your defacements<br>
as you do on IRC right? There's mistake number 1.<br>
You don't use a proxy right? There's mistake number 2<br>
You talk openly about your hacks. There's mistake number 3<br>
Everyone has their enemies. HEH i have loads who doesn't?<br>
This can be used against you. Example:<br>
<br><font color="blue"> Say you are on IRC and you are arguing with that
enemy<br>But there is also a fed in the channel too,<br>
watching EVERYTHING that is being said.<br>
</font><br>
No doubt your enemy knows alot about you.<br>
When you leave the channel the fed says<br>
<font color="blue">"Where does that fucker live, i want to kick his
ass"<br><br></font>
Your enemy would then say to the fed where you live.<br>
Also your enemy would soft of "bond" with the fed.<br>
They would have the same interest, hating you.<br>
Your enemy would glady tell the fed (unknowing that he is a fed of
course)<br>
everything he knows about you. The fed now has a very<br>
big and detailed description of you and what you have done in the
past.<br>
<br>
This does seem a bit far fetched. It is only an example.<br>
But something similar could happen. So please please<br>
<br>
<font color="grey">1. Don't use the nick you deface with on IRC<br>
2. Don't talk freely about your defacements, infact don't<br>
talk about them at all.<br>
3. Don't tell anyone your name or where you live *duh*<br>
but this means even the people you are close to on IRC.<br>
Friendship doesnt last forever and the sceneario above could<br>
happen to you.<br>
4. Don't tell anyone what school you attend either, or<br>
where you currently work/have worked.<br>
5. Feds have bots in nearly every channel on IRC.<br>
They log all the hostmasks and the conversations.<br>
So please use a proxy when you IRC. Also they can<br>
tell if you attend college or whatever by what time<br>
you come on IRC at.<br><br></font>
So be careful people, you dont want to end up<br>
getting anal raped by bubba from cell number 4.<br>
Think about what i have said here on this defacement<br>
and go read that article on antionline.com<br>
<br>
If you get busted your life is over, ask<br>
yourself is all this worth it? You will be<br>
forgotten about 6 months after you have been <br>
busted. So much for that great fame heh.<br>
<br>
Is puting some text on a website worth<br>
your life? The torture you will cause<br>
your parents and family? Having to tell <br>
every employer that you served so many months<br>
or years in jail because you were a hacker.<br>
<br>
Do you think you will get a job with computers?<br>
Or do you think the fbi wont arrest you but employ you<br>
because of your "talents"? HAH. Don't kid yourself.<br>
You are already fucked. Give up now and you might<br>
have a chance of a good life, raise a family and have<br>
a good job, nice house and a car.<br><br>
As you can guess i have quit defacing. I don't have the<br>
balls for it and i don't need to go to jail for<br>
something as stupid as this.<br>
<br>
Peace<br>
Starman_Jones<br><br>
P.S everything i have said here is common sense<br>
i havent just realised this now i have always known it.
