<br>
Another one got caught today, <br>
it's all over the papers. <br>
<br>
&quot;Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, <br>
&quot;Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering&quot;... <br>
<br>
Damn kids. They're all alike. <br>
<br>
But did you, in your <br>
three-piece psychology <br>
and 1950's technobrain, <br>
ever take a look behind <br>
the eyes of the hacker? <br>
Did you ever wonder <br>
<br>
what made him tick, what forces <br>
shaped him, <br>
what may have molded him? <br>
<br>
I am a hacker, enter my world... <br>
<br>
Mine is a world that begins <br>
with school... <br>
I'm smarter than most of <br>
the other kids, this crap they teach <br>
us bores me... <br>
<br>
Damn underachiever. They're all alike. <br>
<br>
I'm in junior high or high school. <br>
I've listened to teachers explain <br>
<br>
for the fifteenth time how to reduce <br>
a fraction. I understand it. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. <br>
I did it in my head...&quot; <br>
<br>
Damn kids <br>
<br>
id. Probably copied it. They're all alike. <br>
<br>
I made a discovery today. <br>
I found a computer. <br>
Wait a second, this is cool. <br>
<br>
It does what I want it to. <br>
If it makes a mistake, <br>
it's because I screwed it up. <br>
Not because it doesn't like me... <br>
Or feels threatened by me... <br>
Or thinks I'm a smart ass... <br>
Or doesn't like teaching <br>
and shouldn't be here... <br>
<br>
Damn kid. All he does is play games. <br>
They're all alike. <br>
<br>
And then it happened... <br>
a door opened to a world... <br>
rushing through the phone line like heroin <br>
through an addict's veins, <br>
an electronic pulse <br>
<br>
is sent out, a refuge from <br>
the day-to-day <br>
incompetencies is sought... <br>
<br>
a board is found. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&quot; <br>
<br>
I know everyone here... <br>
even if I've never met them, <br>
never talked to them, <br>
<br>
may never hear from them again... <br>
I know you all... <br>
<br>
Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. <br>
They're all alike... <br>
<br>
You bet your ass we're all alike... <br>
we've been spoon-fed baby food at <br>
school when we hungered for steak... <br>
the bits of meat that you did let <br>
slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. <br>
We've been dominated by <br>
sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. <br>
The few that had something to teach <br>
<br>
found us willing pupils, but those few are <br>
like drops of water in the desert. <br>
<br>
This is our world now... <br>
the world of the electron and the switch, <br>
<br>
the beauty of the baud. We make use of a <br>
service already existing without <br>
<br>
paying for what could be dirt-cheap <br>
if it wasn't run by profiteering <br>
gluttons, and you call us criminals. <br>
We explore... and you call us <br>
<br>
criminals. We seek after knowledge... <br>
and you call us criminals. We exist <br>
<br>
without skin color, without nationality, <br>
without religious bias... and you <br>
<br>
call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, <br>
you wage wars, you murder, cheat, <br>
and lie to us and try to make us believe <br>
it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. <br>
<br>
Yes, I am a criminal. <br>
My crime is that of curiosity. <br>
My crime is that of <br>
judging people by what they say and think, <br>
not what they look like. <br>
<br>
My crime is that of outsmarting you, <br>
something that you will never forgive me for. <br>
<br>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. <br>
You may stop this individual, <br>
but you can't stop us all... <br>
after all, we're all alike. </strong></big><br>
