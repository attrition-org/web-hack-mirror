        <p align="center">Nowadays we can name more celebrities than we can name capitals of the states of
        America, and does this make us happy? No it doesn't, this hyper techno world kills itself more than ever and while doomsday thinkers say the end is near, we should realize that this is only going to get worse.<br>
        <br>
        You can probably name more brands whose coats cost more than 300$ a piece than you can name presidents. And this  makes you feel super happy? Stealing to be able to afford a coat with a quality of 0 must make you happy then? Did you know that kids probably got paid 2$ to make one coat? Not to mention how cheap the materials are. You don't get that plastic coating to help you from the rain, but because it's cheaper.<br>
        <br>
        And while religious people preach that Jesus saves and God likes it if you pray to a human that killed himself at age 30 because some voice in the sky told him to, they too commit suicide. in the good ole'
        Mormon state of Utah, there are the most suicides of all of America for every 1000 people that live there. God don't love you if you commit suicide, read the bible.<br>
        <br>
        So why do it? It just shows you're weak and that you gave in to whatever was bugging you. Same with hard drugs, are you really so pathetic that you need to destroy your own body to feel some happiness, which isn't happiness, but a bunch of neurons making you believe that for a short while?<br>
        It's proof that there is a massive breakdown going on, drug use is going through the roof with teenagers and so is suicide, and making the sentences longer and the fines higher isn't going to solve the problem which is caused by companies forcing their products upon us all. Not being able to get along in the world because we don't have the latest this or that, or because the rest of the world doesn't like us because we don't have that new twingdoodledang at 459$ a piece makes us feel crappy.<br>
        <br>
        Now Hollywood kicks in noticing we are starting to hate all those stupid no story fighting stories with their fake thriller/think storylines. They give you movies designed to make us "think" making us believe we still have a mind, but we are only allowed to think within limits THEY force upon us.<br>
        The Matrix, Fight Club, The Green Mile, while fun are just designed to make us feel happier about our fate, so we will consume even more.</td>
