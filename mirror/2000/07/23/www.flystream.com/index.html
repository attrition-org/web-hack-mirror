        <p align="center">Life of habit<br>
        No rant or complaints today, just an observation.<br>
        <br>
        When we wake up, what do we do? And did you notice we do it every single day?<br>
        To get food, where do we go? Where everyone else goes of course.<br>
        When we need to go to the toilet, where do we usually go, and where do we go when we're on the highway? And don't we all go there?<br>
        When we go on the net, what do we start? Don't we all?<br>
        <br>
        Strange how we all have such a pattern ground into our stone of existence, isn't it? We don't seem to do anything existing do we? When we ask somebody what's up, what do they always say? We just have out pattern don't we?<br>
        <br>
        Don't we like it, to know that the grocery has Coke AND Pepsi? And don't we have a habit of still looking around in the grocery store although we already know exactly what we want from last time?<br>
        <br>
        Our habits are everywhere. We eat lunch between twelve and two. We have dinner past five. Cars drive and it's not usual for them to be broken
        right?<br>
        <br>
        Shouldn't we be glad then that we're bored or the opposite: have too much to do? Because
        something's probably wrong if it isn't. I just thought I'd share that with you guys.</td>
