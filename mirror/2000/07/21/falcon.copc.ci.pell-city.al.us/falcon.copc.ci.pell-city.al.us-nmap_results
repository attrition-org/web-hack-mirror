Interesting ports on falcon.copc.ci.pell-city.al.us (208.138.65.17):
Port       State       Service
80/tcp     open        http                    

TCP Sequence Prediction: Class=trivial time dependency
                         Difficulty=3 (Trivial joke)
Remote operating system guess: Windows NT4 / Win95 / Win98
