Interesting ports on fflch.fflch.usp.br (143.107.8.20):
Port       State       Service
80/tcp     open        http                    

TCP Sequence Prediction: Class=trivial time dependency
                         Difficulty=7 (Trivial joke)
Remote operating system guess: Windows NT4 / Win95 / Win98
