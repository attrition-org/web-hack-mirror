<P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Us Computer project: FSL High Performance Computing System Project.</font><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0"> US government was targeted because of Kashmir, We think it's about time that US takes some steps on Kashmir, before it's too late, and more innocent lives are lost, We want global awareness on the Kashmir issue, here are some basic facts. This is a response to the Kashmir issue. US It's about time to take steps on Kashmir issue, Do you have any idea what's going on? There are small children being murdered, women being rape, the number of orphans increasing, Why do you guys always come in when you have some thing in it? Like Kashmir issue is 50 year old and if the US wants they could end this up. And then the worst part is that US government then supports INDIA? INDIA is full of fags and they all suck. US, it's about time, lets not waste more innocent lives , we want freedom for Kashmir, stop supporting India</font></P><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0">
<P>For the vast majority of time since 1947, the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir pursued non-violent methods to get the referendum held. The Kashmiri people are now fighting to implement what has been promised to them. They want to come out of the physiological limbo of not knowing if they are Indian, Pakistani or Kashmiri. They want the matter sorted once and for all.</P></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><LI>It is high time to sort this issue out for the following reasons: </LI>
<LI>Over 50,000 Kashmiri's have been killed since 1990.</LI>
<LI>Over 1,000 Indian army people have been killed since 1990. </LI>
<LI>Its time India lived up to its promises. </LI>
<LI>The whole of South Asia is unstable due to this problem, especially now that both India and Pakistan are  nuclear powers. </LI>
<LI>Two great nations namely Pakistan and India have to spend enormous amount of money on </LI>
<P>             their armed forces because of this problem. </P>
<LI>When India and Pakistan takes 5 steps forward the Kashmir issue takes them back 6 steps. </LI>
<LI>There has never been a better time to sort this problem. The cold war has ended, we are at the dawn of the 21st century and the potential consequences of not sorting it out are two high to contemplate. </LI></font></OL><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">

<P>Did we change your views? This is the real Kashmir, I'm sorry if you think these pictures are nasty, but these are the facts of Kashmir. Children like those get killed every day, they are made orphans, their mothers are raped, other women are raped and brutally killed, what is going on? Will some one stop Indian? This has been going on since more then 50 years, yes that's right fifty years, will this ever stop? United Nation also known as 'UN' is sitting their fat asses and doing nothing, We want fredom for kashmir and these atrocities to end.</P>
