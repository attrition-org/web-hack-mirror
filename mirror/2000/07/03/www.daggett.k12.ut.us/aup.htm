<P>Internet access is available to qualifying employees and students of
Daggett School District. These services include access to electronic resources
from <A HREF="http://www.uen.org/utahlink/">UtahLINK</A>, the educational
network supported by the Utah Educational Network (UEN) and the Daggett
County School District (The District) Local Area Network resources. Our
goal is to promote innovation and educational excellence by using Internet
tools for research, worldwide resource sharing, and communication.&nbsp;

<P>The Internet is an electronic highway connecting millions of computers
all over the world. Internet services provide access to electronic mail,
public shareware of all types, many university card catalogs, and massive
databases on computer networks at universities, government agencies, and
private industry.&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="Issues"></A><B>Issues</B>&nbsp;

<P>With access to computers and people all over the world also comes the
availability of material that will not be considered to be of educational
value in the context of the school setting. The Internet may contain material
that is objectionable from many points of view. There is, however, a wealth
of educational material available. Parents and guardians need to decide
whether to permit their children to access the Internet.&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Responsibilities"></A><B>Responsibilities</B></H4>
Internet access is coordinated through a complex association of government
agencies and regional and state networks. In addition, the smooth operation
of the network relies upon the proper conduct of the end-users who must
adhere to strict guidelines. These guidelines are provided so that you
are aware of the responsibilities you are about to acquire. In general,
your responsibilities require ethical, efficient, and legal use of the
network resources. Each student having Internet access will participate
in a discussion with his or her sponsoring teacher regarding acceptable
behavior and use of the network. If a District user violates any of these
terms and conditions, his or her Internet access will be terminated and
future access could be denied. The signature(s) at the end of this document
is (are) legally binding and indicate(s) the party (parties) who signed
has(have) read the terms and conditions carefully and understand(s) their
significance and agree(s) to abide by these terms.&nbsp;
