<CENTER><B>Daggett District Teacher Receives Milken Family Foundation National</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>&nbsp; Educator Award for 1997</B></CENTER>
Harriet Dickerson, a special education teacher at Daggett School District,
was one of six Utah educators to receive the 1997 Milken Educator Award
from the <A HREF="http://www.mff.org">Milken Family
Foundation</A>. In June of 1998, Ms. Dickerson travelled to San Diego to
attend the Education Technology Leadership Academy. The award carries a
cash stipend of $25,000. The fancy envelope (as yet unopened) containing
the check is shown below. All of us at Daggett School District are justifiably
proud of her accomplishments and the recognition she has earned. Harriet
is dedicated to helping her students learn and succeed. She started out
as an aide at the Flaming Gorge Elementary school, and worked her way through
the University of Utah, graduating in 1990. Since that time she has worked
primarily with students at Manila High and Manila Elementary School. We
are all basking in reflected glory.
