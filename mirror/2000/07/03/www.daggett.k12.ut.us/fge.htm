<P>Flaming Gorge Elementary School is located in Dutch John, Utah, about
six miles south of the Wyoming border and about 20 miles west of the Colorado
state line. Dutch John is a "government town;" it was built in the late
1950s to as a housing area for workers building Flaming Gorge Dam and reservoir.
It now serves as a homesite for employees of the US Bureau of Reclamation,
US Forest Service, Utah Parks and Recreation, Utah Department of Wildlife
Resources, Highway Patrol, and other state and federal agencies. Most homes
and buildings belong to the Bureau of Reclamation. Legislation was passed
by Congress which will transfer land in Dutch John to private ownership.
This has caused emmigration from the town; as a result our school has only
27 students at present.&nbsp;

<P>Dutch John is on the "Outlaw Trail," an area favored by such luminaries
as <A HREF="http://www.media.utah.edu/medsol/UCME/c/CASSIDY,BUTCH.html">Robert
LeRoy Parker</A> and Harry Longabaugh (aka Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid).&nbsp;

<P>We have only a dial-up connection to the internet at present. Mr. Durrant,
the district technology director, is installing a wireless spread spectrum
connection for us that we hope will be ready when school opens in August1999.&nbsp;
