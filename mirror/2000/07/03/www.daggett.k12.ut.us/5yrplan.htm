<P><B>Executive Summary</B>

<P>Daggett School District is located in Daggett County Utah, bordering
on Wyoming to the north and Colorado to the east. About 80% of the land
is under federal control, either US Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management.
The tax base is small, as are the population and school enrollments. Approximately
250 students attend the three schools, two elementary and one secondary.
The economy is based almost entirely on tourism, ranching, and government
employment (state, federal, county and local). Despite the small size of
our communities and schools, we have invested heavily in the future of
our children by infusing each classroom with the implements of technology.
We are committed to educating our young people using technological tools
to prepare them for their adult lives which will surely use those same
tools.

<P><B>Planning Committee</B>

<P>The district technology committee comprises the superintendent, district
technology director, high school and elementary principals, one teacher,
one school board member, and one student.

<P><B>Instructional Focus</B>

<P>Our targets in the use of technology in the classroom are to provide
alternative learning opportunities and strategies, and to model the use
of computers as a normal part of everyday life.

<P>Learning will be enhanced and focused through the use of educational
technology resources. Separate plans provide for expenditures to provide
for maintenance, repair and upgrade of the installed base, increased infusion
of technology into classrooms and labs, inservice of staff, both certified
and classified, and purchase, maintenance and upgrade of the physical network
plant.

<P>Each year, 15-20 hours of formal technology inservice is offered to
each teacher and classroom aide. The technology director reserves about
20% of his time to work individually with teachers to assist them in building
technology skills. Another 20% is spent directly working with students
in technology instruction.

<P>A major goal over the life of this plan is to provide each teacher with
a laptop computer to improve productivity and to enable them to work on
lessons, assignments and grading during the evening without returning to
the school. Our technology inservice is geared toward the use of presentation
software and methods.

<P>It is our objective to have every student and every teacher become computer
literate. For years, it has been a tradition at Manila High School to have
a flashy slide show at graduation. The past few years, this tradition has
changed to being a computerized slide show, demonstrating the competence
of students in melding sound, video, scanned and digital images into the
senior presentation. Each year a different group of students (not always
seniors) takes on this major project.

<P>Ongoing, subjective assessment of student and teacher satisfaction with
district technology is conducted by the principals and superintendent.

<P><B>Maintenance</B>

<P>All wiring now being installed is tested to certify compliance with
Category 5 wiring standards, including cables, jacks, patch panels, and
other attachments.

<P>At present, repairs of computers, monitors and peripherals is done within
the district, under warranty, or by using the repair services of the regional
service center at Heber. To date, the need for repairs has been quite limited
as we have stressed quality and warranty in our purchase strategy.

<P>Year One: Complete upgrade at Manila High School from PC Baseband and
LocalTalk to 10BaseT ethernet and ethertalk which was begun in the 1994-95
year. Similar upgrade at Manila Elementary and district office building.
Replace phone wiring in district offices and Manila Elementary. Install
electrical conduit at Manila Elementary to facilitate wire pulls into classroom.
Place conduit between district office building, Manila High School and
Manila Elementary, with fiber optic, coax for video, and twisted pair for
phone links. Clean all equipment (computers, printers, hubs, monitors,
TVs, VCRs, and Laserdisc players) and repair as needed. Unusable equipment
to be reported to district for surplus disposal.

<P>Year Two: Replace or displace Intel 80286 or Motorola 68020 computers
with 80486-, Pentium- or PowerPC-based architecture. Mac LC, IBM Model
30-286 level computers can continue to provide good use in writing labs,
especially at the elementary level. In the high school, most students use
software requiring Mac OS/7 or MS Windows 3.1 or greater, which mandates
faster 32-bit processors. Upgrade wiring plant at Flaming Gorge Elementary
to 10BaseT. Upgrade server from NetWare 2.15 to at least 3.1. Install PVC
conduit for wiring pulls. Install fiber optic backbone at Flaming Gorge.

<P>Years Three to Five: Consider upgrade of networks to higher bandwidths,
e.g. 100BaseT, 100VGAnyLAN, ATM, FDDI or other technologies as they emerge.
Upgrade network file and print services to NetWare 4 (or greater) or similar
32-bit or 64-bit NOS. Continue upgrade/replacement of computers as software
advances render them obsolete.

<P><B>UtahLINK Connectivity</B>

<P>Year One: Constructed a district network operations center in the basement
of Manila Elementary; this site was chosen for ease of access. UtahLINK
T-1 line was installed at this site in October of 1995. Since fiber and
coax links were created during the summer of 1995 connecting the three
buildings in Manila, this simultaneously gave Internet access to Manila
High School and Manila Elementary. The fiber link to the district office
is not yet complete (early 1996), but completion is anticipated by the
end of the 1995-96 school year.

<P>Year Two: (summer of 1996) dial-in access from Flaming Gorge Elementary
in Dutch John to the internet router will be made available using 28K modems.
Concurrently, agreements are being worked out with Green River Wyoming
school district to give the two teachers at McKinnon, WY elementary school
dialup access as well, since that school is also a feeder school to Manila
High School, and it is not long distance.

<P>Years Three to Five: Flaming Gorge School's internet access will be
changed to wireless link (our preferred option to avoid ongoing line costs)
at the earliest opportunity. At present, wireless network links have a
maximum range of about 15 miles, at a cost of nearly $20K. As the technology
improves, we expect to create this kind of link at a more reasonable cost.

<P><B>Other technology operations</B>

<P>Manila High School has been an EdNet site since its inception. The EdNet
system occupies a classroom at the high school, which it will share with
the USU ComNet system beginning early 1996. Between these systems, students
have available a wide array of concurrent enrollment college classes. Fewer
students take high school credit classes over the EdNet system. A satellite
receiver is located at the high school. During year one, the cable television
system was extended from Manila High School to Manila Elementary. The cable
operator has installed bi-directional amplifiers in his system, so that
programming can originate at either school and be presented over the community
cable system. The EdNet programming, as well as the satellite channels,
can be viewed on a receive only basis in every classroom in Manila Elementary
and High Schools. During year two, we expect to install a satellite receiver
at Flaming Gorge Elementary. Using EdNet, ComNet and satellite television,
we expect to continue to fill curricular gaps, especially in math and foreign
language.

<P><B>Inservice</B>

<P>During the summer of 1995, two employees, Guy Durrant (technology director)
and LuDell Madsen (elementary teacher) attended the USWest/UtahLINK teacher
trainer institutes. In October and November, they provided 10 hours of
inservice training to each of 24 teachers and staff members. All personnel
who contact students in a classroom setting were invited to attend. Three
additional staff members began the training but have not yet completed
it. A district acceptable use policy for internet access was developed
and accepted by the school board. Training centered on using the internet
to increase teacher communication with out of district peers, and in locating
appropriate instructional resources. An additional five hours of formal
inservice in information technology will be given to each certified employee
during the school year. On a less formal basis, all teachers are provided
with "help desk" assistance, on a frequent basis, by the technology director.

<P>During the ensuing four years, each teacher and administrator will receive
a minimum of 15 hours per year of inservice training.

<P><B>Evaluation</B>

<P>Evaluation of technology use will be assessed through the technology
committee, personnel evaluations and student norm- and criterion-referenced
assessments, including Stanford-8 and end-of-level/end-of-course documents.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>The technology committee will meet not less than quarterly to assess
progress toward yearly goals. Principals, the superintendent and the technology
director will evaluate teacher and student progress in utilizing classroom
technology.</CENTER>
