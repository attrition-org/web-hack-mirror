From June 26, 2000 to July 21, 2000, eWEEK (formerly PC Week) set up a number
of servers as a challenge, to see if the servers could be compromised in one
of four specific ways.  According to the rules, this was not a successful
compromise; however, it -was- a defacement, so Attrition has mirrored it.
