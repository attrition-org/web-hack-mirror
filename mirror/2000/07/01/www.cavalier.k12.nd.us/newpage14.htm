    <p align="center"><small>Superintendent</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Mr. Dunlop is in his first year as superintendent at Cavalier High
    School. He received his high school education at Rolla High School, graduated from
    Mayville State in Business and Social Studies, earned his Master's Degree at UND,
    specialist at NDSU, and doctorate at UND. The schools he worked at previously include
    Carson, ND; a school in Idaho; Dunseith, ND; County Superintendent; Golden Valley, ND; and
    Glenburn, ND. He went into school administration because he needed a job, applied, and was
    offered the administrator position. He also thanks his mentors for their encouragement to
    go on to get his Master's Degree. If he could change one thing about CHS, he would ask for
    more mutual respect for one another. The one thing he would like to tell people is that
    he's not such a bad guy.</small><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <p align="left"><small>This is Deann Boschert's second year as Cavalier's High School
    Principal. She received her B.S. degree from NDSU and M.S. degree from Tri-College in
    Fargo. She went on to teach in Bismarck, Hazelton, Kenmare, Walhalla, and Edinburg, ND.
    She was also a teacher and principal intern in El Paso, TX. Mrs. Boschert taught at a
    Catholic School in Mississauga, Ontario Canada.&nbsp; Mrs. Boschert went into school
    administration because she thought that she could make changes and improvements through
    this position. Her favorite part of this job is working with the students. The one
    difference she would like to make would be that Cavalier have a curfew for its students. </small><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    for nine years. He also was the Elementary Principal at Central-Valley for one year. Mr.
    Houdek went into school administration because, after thirteen years, he thought he would
    like to be at new level. His favorite part about his job is seeing the children grow and
    make progress.</small><!--mstheme--></font></td>
