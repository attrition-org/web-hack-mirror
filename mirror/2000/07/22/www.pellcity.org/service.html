<p>Pell City&#146;s Mayor and five council members elected by district, is a prime example
of what makes the town work along with the fast growth. City Hall is a combination of long
time residents and newcomers who, &#147;feel that change is going to bring positive
results as we adjust to absorb the growth. Since Pell city is a sought after location, our
city government has people who are more than qualified for their jobs. In this size
town,&#148; the mayor continues, &#147;you are more personally involved. Elected officials
see local people often and they expect a lot of us. What&#146;s more, there is opportunity
for everyone to be involved. In fact,&#148; he adds with a smile, &#147;expect to be
involved. If you don&#146;t, we&#146;ll come and get you.&#148; </p>

bursting at the seams,&#148; observes the Fire Chief and he and 31 employees are working
to assure that growth is safe. A third fire station opened recently and a fourth one is
planned for the future.&nbsp; Fire fighters, all state certified, are supported by our
pump trucks, a new rescue unit, a ladder truck, and a service truck to furnish an on-site
supply of oxygen. Of the 12 paramedics the chief says, &#147;I would put my fire medics
against anybody in the state.&#148; Fire prevention is a major emphasis, the best example
being Pell City&#146;s fully-sprinkled elementary school that is schedule to open for next
school year and is the only one in Alabama. Phone (205) 338-6006. </p>
