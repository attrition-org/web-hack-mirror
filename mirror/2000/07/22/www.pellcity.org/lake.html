<p>Logan Martin Lake&#146;s 275 mile shoreline is one of Pell City&#146;s most exciting
features. &#147;It&#146;s two lakes really,&#148; explains a conservation officer familiar
with the area. There is the broad lake with many homes, like a big subdivision with plenty
of area for water sports. When the Coosa River narrows the scenic setting where eagles and
ospreys soar and deer come to the shore for a drink, trees bend shading branches into the
lake, a place for solitude and communing with nature. </p>

<p>Two hundred seventy-five miles of shoreline offers hundreds of coves to fit every mood
and activity. Take your choice of shady, sunny, fishing, skiing, or wading. There are
sailing clubs and several ski clubs. The shoreline is dotted with marinas, bait shops,
boat and motor rentals and nearby there are marine stores, motels, and restaurants
conveniently located. </p>

<p>Full time residents are a large part of the lake&#146;s population living in a variety
of homes from cabins to magnificent estate homes and everything in between. Many are
professional people who must work in an urban area but prefer to make the short drive and
see the sunset over the lake. In winter they relish the quiet, the cry of a loon,
migrating ducks, or the solitary blue heron fishing. During the summer, visitors and
vacationers transform the lake into a resort. As soon as school is out the population
soars and the lake sizzles with water skiers and boating fun. Retirees have also
discovered this lake and find that with the services, shopping, and medical facilities in
Pell City close by this &#145;country living in the city limits&#146; is the perfect
retirement area. </p>

<h2>Fishing and Hunting</h2>

<p><img src="images/fishing.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="224">This is a
sportsman&#146;s paradise with 18,000 acres for fishing. Fishermen learn that there are
actually two different lakes. During summertime&#146;s full pool there is plenty of deep
cool water where the prize winning bass swim. In winter a five foot draw-down reveals
islands and shoreline creating a whole new fishing challenge. </p>

<p>Duck, quail, dove and deer are found on several thousand acres of open permit land for
hunting. Numerous private hunting clubs have a place for just about any aspiring hunter. </p>

<h3>Bass Masters Classic</h3>

<p>You know the fishing is excellent when the world&#146;s best choose to gather here.
This &#147;Super Bowl&#148; of fishing has selected Logan Martin for several years, the
finest compliment a fishing area can receive. <br clear="all">

<p><img src="images/park.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="207"> Pell City&#146;s
Lakeside Park makes the lake accessible for every citizen, resident or not. The lake
breezes cool tennis courts and ball fields. </p>

<p>In many towns you might hear someone say &#147;Let&#146;s drive to the lake for the
weekend!&#148; In Pell City you might hear, &#147;Let&#146;s go to the lake for a few
minutes, for our lunch break, for the afternoon.&#148; It&#146;s right around the corner. <br
