<p>&quot;An economic hot spot in the Southeast.&quot;  That&#146;s is the way the Wall Street Journal described Pell City.  Location, location, location, sums up the reasons for industry&#146;s attraction to this mushrooming area.  Adjacent to interstate 20, with tow other major highways 231 and 78 through town, and situated between the major metropolitan areas of Birmingham and Atlanta with a major airport 30 minutes away.  Add in overnight truck services to and from half the population of the United States and rail service in the industrial park.  Combine theses with a quality work force drawn from a large area and it is easy to see why new industries are moving in and equally as important, why existing industries are expanding.  One of the lowest unemployment rates in the state is the result, 3.1%
