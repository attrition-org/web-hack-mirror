<p><img src="images/highscol.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="216">One of the youngest school systems in the state, created in 1982, is also one of the finest, thriving on local support.  January 1992 was another milestone for this system.  That year a group of over one hundred community leaders met to ask, &quot;What can we do as a community to improve education for our children?&quot;  The result was the Pell City Schools Foundation that raises funds from individuals and corporations then uses investment income to award annual grants to teachers for use in a variety of academic endeavors.  Twelve Chairs each representing a gift of $10,000 have been endowed through this foundation.  Classroom teachers have received almost $50,000.

<p>This tradition of excellence began in the town's pioneering days when founder Sumter Cogswell made it a priority to build a schoolhouse in Pell City.  By 1905 the town had a school system with nine months of free schooling.

<p>In 1982, the city organized a separate school system and quality education grew by leaps and bounds.  Today there are five schools with a total enrollment of 3,600.  Since 1982, average expenditure-per-pupil has increased 64%.  Local support has increased 88%.

<p><img src="images/element.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="306" HEIGHT="204">Every school benefits from active Parent Teacher Organizations and recently Pell City Schools carried this idea a step further by organizing PTSO's, involving not only parents and teachers but also students.  Many of the parents are involved in direct volunteer programs, parent luncheons, a grandparents day and serve on an advisory board.  Superintendents' office: Phone (205) 884-4440.

<p>Excellent teachers are the hallmark of a fine school system and in Pell City the majority of teachers have a masters degree.  Each elementary school has teachers who specialize in physical education, library services, art and music.  The results of good teaching show up in honors such as the Scholar Bowl Program where our teams consistently place high in state competition.  In this system we expect and we receive the finest student performance.  The graduation requirements exceed those set by the State Board of Education and students' scores on the state testing program consistently exceed state averages.  Over 52 percent of our graduates go on to attend a two or four year college or university.
