In the famous children's classic, The Town Mouse, The County Mouse, the lesson was clear:
you can enjoy living in one setting or the other but not both. Obviously the author never
lived in Pell City where you can have the advantages of both town and country; where there
is small town courtesy and security, quite lakeside living, family fun and yet, 30 miles
away on I-20 are the bright lights of Birmingham with plays, concerts and museums or drive
90 minutes east and enjoy the metropolitan Atlanta area. You'll enjoy returning to the
city just because it's so nice to come home to Pell City. </p>

<h2>The Civic Center</h2>
</a>

<h3>A Haven for Activity</h3>

<p><img src="images/civiccen.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="302" HEIGHT="200"> One of the
town's favorite gathering spots is the Civic Center on highway 34, adjacent to Logan
Martin Lake. Find an indoor gym, classrooms, banquet facilities and a walking track. Take
classes such as jazzercise, arts and crafts, karate, gymnastics, even square dancing and
our seniors get into the act with Body Recall, low impact aerobics. As if there weren't
enough to do inside the building, surrounding it there is a 65 acre lakeside park with
picnicking facilities-pavilions and individual tables, playground for the kids, walking
trails, fishing and boat launching. You can see why churches, family reunions,
corporations, even wedding parties seek out these delightful facilities. And imagine the
community fun when adult teams of softball, volleyball and baseball show off their skills
for the cheering crowds. <br clear="all">
</p>

<p><img src="images/lilleag.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="278" HEIGHT="173">The tennis courts
are a popular site and of course the kids have a variety of sports to choose from also.
Soccer, baseball, basketball, softball. This recreation program just keeps growing. Five
years ago there were eight girls' softball teams. Today there are 20 in addition to 20
youth baseball teams. You are bound to find friends and fun at the Civic Center no matter
your interest. This versatile building is also available for banquets, meetings, and
parties. <br clear="all">
</p>

<p>Fishing is popular year-round at the nearby piers and boating begins by launching at
the boat ramp on the Civic Center grounds. </p>
