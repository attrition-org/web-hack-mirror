<p><font size="+2"><i><b>Growing</b></i></font>, growing. That&#146;s the word you hear
all over Pell City, from the tree shaded soda shop and drugstore downtown to the brand new
mansions on Logan Martin Lake. </p>

<p><i>Growth.</i>From historic Avondale Mills, the town&#146;s oldest and still largest
industry, to the new and expanding Benjamin Moore industry producing high tech coatings. </p>

<p><i>Growth.</i> No wonder since this is the third fastest growing area in the state of
Alabama. In less than ten years the population has doubled. It is predicted to double
again in the next ten. From nearby urban areas from out of state, from far-ranging locales
they came and they are still coming. There are many reasons &#150; location, lake, small
town friendliness, plenty of jobs &#150; or there could be just one reason. As a newcomer
explains, &#147;Everybody wants to live in a town where you can walk the streets at night
and not be afraid.&#148; </p>

<p><img src="images/rexall.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="207">The features that
attract people to Pell City today are the same features that fired the imagination of
Sumter Cogswell, an insurance agent traveling through in 1890. He was enchanted with what
he found: an infant village composed of a depot built by three railroads that met here and
one hotel for the train travelers. Cogswell was so impressed with the natural beauty of
Pell City he immediately saw the possibility of a thriving town. Near the river. Looking
into the hills. Close to two major markets, Birmingham and Anniston and the three
railroads. He organized the Pell City Iron and Land Company which bought the 400 acres for
50,000 dollars and incorporated the town on May 6, 1891. </p>

<p>A few years later, in 1901, Cogswell again passed through the town and found that the
panic of 1893-94 had left it virtually a ghost town of only 40 people. This time Mr.
Cogswell himself bought the town. No wonder that the main street bears his name. He became
a one-man industry hunter, donating acreage to bring a textile mill to town. 1,500 people
followed. For many years, &#147;the mill was the town, operating the school and the
hospital,&#148; according to a local historian. That established a lasting legacy of
industry and town supporting each other. Retail thrived when the Pell City Drug Co. was
founded in 1902 and is still the center of town. In the early 1900&#146;s all roads, it
seemed, led through Pell City. The famed Washington to the Pacific Coast highway was
routed through town. The Bankhead Highway from Birmingham to Atlanta was completed on
1933. </p>

<p>During World War I only one other town in the United States furnished more soldiers and
subscribed to more for liberty bonds in proportion to population than Pell City. </p>

<p align="center">In 1956 there was more growth when the neighboring towns of Eden and Oak
Ridge merged with Pell City. The town experienced steady growth, but still, says one
resident, &#147;We were kind of a hidden treasure and the lake was kind of a
kick-off.&#148; </p>

<h3 align="center">A Hidden Treasure Discovered</h3>

<p>The Coosa River winding south of Pell City transported riverboats and cotton in the
early days. After the steam boat era it was known mostly to fishermen. In 1964, all that
changed when Logan Martin Dam was built forming a lake with 275 miles of shoreline, so
beautifully curved that it was christened &quot;The Lake of a Thousand Coves.&quot; This,
along with the discovery of a friendly town so close to the city yet so far removed in
tranquillity caused a population boom. In 1989, there were 8500 citizens. Less than ten
years later, the population reached 16,000. </p>

<p>Yet all this growth has only added to the community's spirit. &quot;You go to the
grocery store and you don't know everybody now,&quot; explains one long time resident,
&quot;but all you have to do is speak and pretty soon you'll know them.&quot; Growth is an
opportunity for every citizen to benefit. &quot;We're not going to be able to keep it as
small as we might as well grow with it.&quot; Another old timer says with a smile,
&quot;Most are good people and when we draw those who are not, I think we kind of reform
'em.&quot; </p>

<p>The mayor and city council, a combination of long time citizens and new residents, is
an example of the blending of old and new in this city described by one as, &quot;popping
at the seams. If we are going to grow the city must take a major role in controlling its
destiny. We believe that while Pell City is in a period of substantial growth, we were
elected to see that we maintain a high quality of life, while guiding the growth.&quot; </p>

<p>Artist, crafters, and potters are drawn here, finding in this tranquil atmosphere a
setting for creativity. Pell City native and internationally-know watercolorist, Wayne
Spradley, welcomes them. <br>

<h4>Churches</h4>

<p><img src="images/church.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="374">&quot;I would say if
you want to find a friend, find a church,&quot; advises a long time resident. The town's
first Sunday School was held in the building which stood behind Pell City Drug Company.
Small kegs and wooden boxes were used for seats. The Cogswell family donated land for
church sites to a number of denominations. From that beginning the town's religious life
has grown to 30 churches in the city representing eight denominations with dozens more in
the surrounding area. Even with such diversity of denominations, when the community has
needs these churches often work together, supporting such efforts as the &quot;Love
Pantry&quot; which supplies food for those with special needs. </p>

<p>Industry is finding in Pell City, a nurturing environment with interstate access, two
industrial parks, a county airport and impressive medical facilities. There is a rich pool
of loyal skilled employees to encourage success. Executives are delighted to transfer to
this idyllic spot, some choosing to live within walking distance of downtown, other
choosing Lake Logan Martin and all finding a climate that varies just enough, &quot;but no
extremes,&quot; to keep everybody happy. In the summertime average July temperature is 82
degrees while January's average is 39 degrees. </p>

<p>Building permits, both residential and business are up 42% and still climbing. Every
style and price of home can be found. Demand for apartments has grown and is being met by
a number of established as well as new complexes. Town houses are emerging. Around Logan
Martin Lake waterfront property is a sought after treasure. Off water lots are increasing
in popularity for their price and accessibility to the lake. Summer homes account for some
lake houses but many are owned by full time residents who work in Pell City or by
commuters, working in Birmingham, Anniston, and other nearby towns who prefer to come home
to Pell City. &quot;I am meeting new neighbors from all over the world,&quot; says one
lake resident. </p>

<p>On the lake the cost of a 2,000 square foot waterfront home averages $140,000 with
larger homes averaging $225,000. Off water (both near the lake and in town) homes range
form $80,000 to $110,000 on. A leading realtor says, &quot;Its one of the few places I've
seen where you can buy a home, pay all the costs then sell a year later and make money.
One reason for these satisfied homeowners is the local homebuilders. You're going to see
them on the street everyday and know them by their reputations.&quot; </p>

<p>Sumter Cogswell might not recognize the little village he nursed to life in the early
1900's. He would be awed at the bustle of industry, amazed at the huge expanse of
sparkling lake water, puzzled by the zip and zing of modern life, but when he walked down
the street to be greeted by neighbors, or if he took a seat in the old soda shop downtown,
he would still feel right at home in Pell City. </p>
