    family development and enhance family functioning by coordinating services for children
    and families involved in child abuse. The center also facilitates cooperation between
    agencies, offers training for professionals, and provides education that will increase

    District Attorney's Office, The Department of Human Resources, and Friends of Children, a
    volunteer child abuse prevention organization, joined together by investing time and
    resources to make the center a reality. In 1993, a house designed specifically to meet the
    need of the center was donated through the generosity of a St. Clair County family. In
    addition, many other civic groups, churches, and individuals have given support to the
    center through donated items, financial contributions, and volunteer time. The center was
    fully operational in July of 1994.</font></p>
