    centralized location where child victims, non-offending family members, and agency
    officials involved in child sexual and serious physical abuse investigations come together
    to coordinate their services. Here, the difficult process of evaluating, intervening and
    evidence gathering can take place in a non-threatening environment, thus <b>reducing
    trauma on the child</b>. The <b>child's initial interview</b> is monitored via closed
    circuit television by a Multidisciplinary Team that consists of representatives of one or
    more of the following agencies: the district attorney's office, the department of human
    resources, juvenile probation, law enforcement and various private therapeutic groups. </font><p align="left"><img src="BBltr2.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="1" width="350" height="180" align="right" alt="Braveheart Letter 2"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp; T</font><font size="4">here
    are several components to a child's interview, such as obtaining information regarding the
    child's developmental level, testing the child's ability to discern between the truth and
    a lie, extrapolation of alleged abuse, unfolding the child's expectations, and closure to
    the interview. More than one interview is occasionally necessary.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, prior to and immediately following
    the child's interview, <b>the parents meet with the Multidisciplinary Team</b>, refered to
    as PACT (Professionals Against Child Trauma). The initial meeting is necessary to discuss
    the allegations, to gain insight into the parent's impression of the allegation, to
    understand the child's developmental level, and to obtain information for collaborating
    the child's story. Following the interview, the team meets with the parent and confirms or
    rejects their initial impression of the allegation. They also discuss ensuing steps, such
    as subsequent interviews with the alleged perpetrator, and possible prosecution. Medical
    and therapeutic referrals are made at this time.</font></p>

    charge, this service is available when a report of sexual or serious physical abuse is
    filed through the department of human resources, law enforcement agencies or the district
    attorney's office. Criterion for using this service is that the child either resides in
    St. Clair County or the incident happened in St. Clair county; however, courtesy
    interviews are conducted upon request for other counties which do not have Advocacy
    Centers.</font></p>
