<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Please submit an outline on a self selected
topic covering either the problems or solutions surrounding network security.&nbsp;
The focus of the three tracks are as follows:</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Track 1, Uber Haxor</font></u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">- These talks could include source
code examples, specific focus on a technical detail, or any topic that
may require previous knowledge.&nbsp; The nuts and bolts.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Track 2, Haxor</font></u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">- These talks might cover demonstrations,
examples and overviews of new attacks, technologies, or trends.&nbsp; These
are technical issues all security practitioners should be aware of.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Track 3, Newbie</font></u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">- These talks will help new comers
to the scene get a better understanding of many topics.&nbsp; Introductions
to TCP/IP, Phones, radios, and unix hacking were some of the popular topics
from last year.&nbsp; These topics, if updated to current, would continue
to be great topics.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The examples of topics is to give ideas
and direction to potential speakers, and is not the ultimate list.&nbsp;
Just ideas.&nbsp; Because of the unique nature of this conference, the
emphasis is on where the rubber meets the road, what is new and cool, major
announcements (al la BO2k), and topics hackers wouldn't normally come across.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Talks will be up to an hour in length,
and it is expected the speaker will make time for audience participation
and Q&amp;A.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Submissions should be in a outline format
to give us an idea of the quality and depth of your speech.&nbsp; Please
include what track you are submitting to, and how much time you would like
for your talk.&nbsp; If you need more than one LCD wall projector for a
demonstration, etc., please advise how many you need.&nbsp; When at DEF
CON we will get a copy of your talk to put on-line, as well as record your
track.&nbsp; By speaking at DEF CON you are granting DEF CON, Inc. permission
to reproduce, distribute, and potentially advertise your presentation on
www.defcon.org Send submissions to <a href="mailto:talks@defcon.org">talks@defcon.org</a>.</font></td>

it enhances your presentation.&nbsp; Current tools made available to speakers
include LCD projectors, overhead projectors, and slide projectors.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This year there will be up to two LCD projectors
in a session.&nbsp; If your talk requires any sort of demonstration we
encourage you to set up a network (Machines can be provided) and have each
machine projecting on one of the LCDs.&nbsp; Audience members will be able
to follow along what is occurring on each node as the talks progress, or
the speaker may provide different information on different screen, etc.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Please forward any additional resource
questions to dtangent@defcon.org.&nbsp; Speakers will be subscribed to
a mailing list that includes the other conference speakers in an attempt

going to increase the quality of the talks by screening people and topics
better.&nbsp; I realize you guys are speaking for basically free, but some
talks are better than others.&nbsp; Some people put in a bit more effort
than others.&nbsp; I want to reward the people who do the work by making

accepted outline.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"></font></font>

technical or reveal new vulnerabilities are of more interest than a review

content or research that have been created for DEF CON and has not been
seen before.</font></font>
