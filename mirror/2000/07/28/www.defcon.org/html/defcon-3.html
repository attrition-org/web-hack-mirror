Steele</a></u>: </font></i></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>President
of OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS, Inc. A former Spy, Experienced Bureaucrat, Radical
Visionary. Tofflers call him the "rival store" to CIA. Robert will explain
why Hackers should be considered a national asset.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Robert David Steele is the
bureaucrat's worst nightmare: a highly educated and skilled bureaucrat
himself, now a successful businessman, who has seen the light and been
quoted around the world--including the notorious Singapore Straits Times
saying "hackers are a national resource. He means it, and people are starting
to listen.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Steele spent 18 years as
a Central Intelligence Agency spy and Marine Corps intelligence officer.&nbsp;
He has done three overseas tours recruiting traitors, participated in signal
collection operations, helped program funds of overhead imagery satellites,
and been the senior civilian responsible for establishing the new $20 million
Marine Corps Intelligence Center.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He holds graduate degrees
in international relations (predicting revolution) and public administration
(strategic and tactical information management for national security),
is a distinguished graduate of the Naval War College, completed the Harvard
Executive Program (Intelligence Policy), and spent two years at CIA expense
learning about artificial intelligence.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Steele was introduced to
cyberspace by Howard Rheingold and John Perry Barlow, and he's never been
the same. His article in the Whole Earth Review, "E3i: Ethics, Ecology,&nbsp;
Evolution, and Intelligence" established for the first time the concept
of a citizens intelligence agency (cia) and an "open books" approach to
national intelligence.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Do *not* make the mistake
of thinking Steele is anti-establishment--on the contrary, he *is* the
establishment--of the future--and his contemporaries in the halls of power
are just starting to figure that out. Where Steele makes a different, is
in understanding that the communications and computing industries have
been criminally negligent (or maybe just stupid), the government has been
out to lunch, and hackers have something important to say about making
cyberspace a safe place to work and play.</font></font>

of IRC Girrrlz, including <a href="/SPEAKERS/DC-3/vamprella.jpg">Vamprella</a></font>.

<font size=-1>"Don't you hate it when that happens?"</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I was going to talk about
all the really bad things that have happened to me and a lot of other people
in the past year. You know, like having your shoe stolen while you're eating
at Taco Bell. That happened to me.&nbsp; Or your house catching fire. Or
getting stuck in a dumpster. Or having your head shaved when you are asleep.
Or having someone impersonate you on IRC and then finding out that your
friends actually think the impersonator is nicer and cooler than you. I
was going to write about stuff like having your uninsured new laptop computer
stolen, like..yes this really happened to me before someone stole my shoe
and my NIN CD. But then I thought, hey, why not talk about something happier.
So I asked all the people I could find 'what is happy' and they said "LOVE".&nbsp;
Well, some of them said some variations of it, but generally it involved
male and female interaction.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, thinks me, this is a
perfect thing to talk about. I already studied and released a linguistics
study on how males and females talk differently on IRC in hacking channels.
(Females are more technically inclined,&nbsp; vocabulary wise). But that
wasn't really about 'love'. So, I decided to just ask people 'What are
you like..if some guy wants to find a girl that he could actually really
'love', what kind of girls would you say are in this scene'.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>My little talk is entitled
females of #hack -- not 'female hackers' and not 'females in search of
hackers', but females of #hack. A more appropriate title would be "what
are women who are into the hacking scene and who hang out on IRC and who
don't have anything better to do than answer these dumb questions really
like like?" but this little talk is as it is. females of #hack. all lower
case. The reason I'm going to be talking about this is because lot of guys
ask me where they can meet girls. Girls who know about computers. Girls
who know what hacking is about. Girls who understand those late nights
at the lab. So come see what the IRC hacker femmes have to say, complete
with slides. Ok, so I drew them with crayons. But so what. If you're nice,
I bet they will send you GIFS.&nbsp;</font></font>

Campbell</a></u>: </font></i></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Q
&amp; A, overview of Governmental activities and stuff surrounding Area-51.
Here is the <a href="/SPEAKERS/DC-3/area-51.jpg">airport</a> the workers
leave from in Las Vegas.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Glenn Campbell, 35, is the
principal local activist seeking greater government accountability at "Area
51," a secret military base 90 miles north of Las Vegas. Formerly a successful
computer programmer from Boston, Campbell moved to the remote town of Rachel,
Nevada, in Jan. 1993 to investigate the many strange stories emanating
from the base.&nbsp; His carefully researched book, "The Area 51 Viewer's
Guide," helped bring mainstream attention to a story that had been dominated
by UFO and conspiracy buffs with little concern for facts.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Campbell declares himself
"seriously interested" in some of the UFO tales emanating from Nevada's
military restricted zone, but he dismisses most of the lights-in-the-sky
stories reported in Rachel, 25 miles north of the base.&nbsp; "This place
is a circus," says Campbell.&nbsp; "Anyone can make any claim they want
here and get away with it.&nbsp; Commerce, not truth, seems to be the primary&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>motivation here."&nbsp;
Campbell points out that the area above Rachel is an "intense war games
area" where exotic looking lights are produced by conventional military
hardware.&nbsp; Campbell himself says he has never seen a UFO in his 2-1/2
years living in Rachel.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Campbell is a bitter enemy
of the owners of the Little A'Le'Inn, the well publicized bar, motel and
restaurant in Rachel that caters to UFO believers.&nbsp; They consider
him a government agent who has been sent to debunk the UFO sightings here
and "muddy the waters" in favor of the military.&nbsp; Campbell, in turn,
considers the owners profiteers who are equally obscuring the truth by&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>endorsing all UFO sightings
as real.&nbsp; Campbell is also not on good terms with Ambassador Merlyn
Merlin II from the planet Draconis, a claimed "alien-in-human-form" who
is frequent visitor to Rachel.&nbsp; "The Area 51 story has become a magnet
for every nut case on the planet," says Campbell.&nbsp; "This is a shame,
because whatever the truth may be at Area 51, it is being overwhelmed by
the noise."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Glenn Campbell supports himself
through his personal investments and his mail-order business.&nbsp; He
maintain a major presence on the Internet with a free monthly email newsletter
(circulation: over 3000 copies) and a popular World Wide Web page.&nbsp;
Campbell is widely respected for his Area 51 research because he sticks
to the facts and a rarely engages in the kind of baseless speculation that
dominates the UFO field.&nbsp; "I am fighting primarily for less secrecy
and greater government accountability, which are goals I think everyone
can agree with regardless of their view on UFOs," Campbell says.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Campbell's email address
is psychospy@aol.com.&nbsp; Requests for subscriptions to his newsletter
should be directed to area51rc@aol.com.&nbsp; A catalog of publications

Carefully consider your intentions before embarking down the road of serious
hacking. How far are you willing to go?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Oscar Meyer?&nbsp; Well,
he's a real wiener.&nbsp; He is affectionately known to some of his friends
as a corn-ball geezer.&nbsp; He's been more or less successful at hacking
most everything that he has comes across for most of his nearly 50 years.&nbsp;
He thinks that hacking might just be a way of life, holds unconventional
views, and generally flounders about trying to make things work better.&nbsp;
Although he believes that anything and anyone can be hacked, he is often
less successful than he'd like to be.&nbsp; However, he keeps on trying.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Getting past the front door
is challenging, interesting and fun.&nbsp; However, once you are in, what
do you do?&nbsp; Rummaging around, deleting things, screwing things up,

to do after you have you've attained access that is not specifically authorized

"The Party's Over: Why Hacking Sucks." Stepehen intends to play "devil's
advocate" and suggest that "hacking should not be tolerated in any shape
or form as it serves no useful purpose and is a menace to society."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Stephen Cobb, an employee
of the National Computer Security Association, is Co-Chair of the Computer
Ethics and Responsibilities Campaign. He is also, by birth, a Libra, and
thus given to weighing both sides of everything. He has been</font></font>

but has never attempted unauthorized access. He believes in gun control
but practices target shooting. He doesn't believe in income taxes, but
pays them anyway. He is British by birth, but holds an American passport.
A former Rugby player, he is an ex-member of Mensa and the National Organization
for Women. In 1970, while still in high school, he charged police lines
in protest at the all-white South African Rugby tour. In 1995 he cheered
the multi-racial South African victory in the Rugby World Cup.</font></font>
