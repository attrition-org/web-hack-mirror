party for hackers held in Las Vegas, Nevada, every summer for the past
seven years.&nbsp; Over those years it has grown in size, and attracted
people from all over the planet.&nbsp; Well, no one from North Korea has
shown up (that we know of) but if they did I'm sure we would convince them
to tell us elite government sekrets.&nbsp; That's what it is all about.&nbsp;
Meeting other spies, er, people and learning something new.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are not trying to teach you to learn
how to hack in a weekend, but what we are trying to do is create an environment
where you can hang out with people from all different backgrounds. All
of them interested in the same thing, computer security.&nbsp; To do this
we have taken over the complete hotel at the Alexis Park Resort.&nbsp;
Does all of this seem interesting?&nbsp; Then it can be yours for the low
low price of only $50 at the door.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you want a greater idea of what it is
all about, and what other poeple have had to say about the convention please
visit the previous year's archives sections and read what the media and
attendees have had to say.</font>

bad happens: your servers get hacked through your firewall, and that expensive

that most commercial IDSs are little more than anti-script-kiddy tools

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Mr. Erickson will talk about
number theory, complexity theory, cryptography, and quantum computing.&nbsp;
The basics of number theory pertinent to cryptography will be covered,
including modular math, the Euclidian GCD algorithm and Euler's totient
function and theorem.&nbsp; Complexity theory and tractability will be
explained to give a feeling for what a 'hard' problem is (NP vs P) and
algorithmic runtime and Big-O notation with respect of input size will
be explained to show why factoring the product of two large prime numbers
isn't trivial.&nbsp; Then the RSA encryption/decryption algorithms will
be derived from scratch, using modular math, GCD, and Euler's totient function.&nbsp;
A few factoring methods will be described, to emphasize the complexity
involved in factoring the product of two large prime numbers.&nbsp; Then
the basics of quantum computation will be explained; superposition, EPR
state, decoherence, controlled NOT gates, and entanglement.&nbsp; The actual
quantum mechanics will be skipped to focus on the algorithms.&nbsp; Peter
Shor's quantum factoring algorithm will be explained and demonstrated,
breaking RSA in two steps.&nbsp; Lov Grover's quantum search algorithm
will be explained and it's ability to brute force anything in sqrt(N) steps
will hopefully be apparent.&nbsp; Since most conventional encryption will
be shown to be insecure, a few quantum encryption techniques will be covered.&nbsp;

Erickson was the product of a 6th grade science fair experiment in human
genetics by little Snirk Cojeno on planet Vega 7 (His parents helped a
little bit).&nbsp; After the fair was over, Jon was sold as slave labor
by the elementary school to the Orb Night intergalactic casting and modeling
agency.&nbsp; Due to his dashing good looks and human neck, Jon quickly
found himself the poster boy for Zarlak's explosive human restraint collars;
his likeness plastered all over space billboards and magazines.&nbsp; The
fame went to his head, and Jon soon attempted to join the unions, despite
the strict regulations against human slaves working like the frees do.&nbsp;
He was sentenced to 160 years on the Prison Planet Earth.&nbsp; As if exile
to Earth wasn't bad enough, moments after landing, he was quickly carted
away to Area 51 by the US Government, only to be traded to a Japanese research
group in exchange for some rare Pokemon cards by an agent named Jose Ronnick.&nbsp;
In Japan, the brilliant Dr. Kenji Cronos and a lab tech named michelle
began an experimental open-brain surgery procedure on Jon, hoping to teach
him about human emotion.&nbsp; Something went horribly wrong, and when
the anasthetic wore off, Jon woke up in an empty operating room, with a
giant hole his skull.&nbsp; All the colors began to taste like blue again,
and he panicked, plugging the hole with paper mache and running into the
streets to forage for himself.&nbsp; With 142 years left in his prison
sentence, Jon began his own scientific research in the realms of cryptography,
parallel algorithms and processing, artificial intelligence, and complexity
theory, and has lived as a student, teacher, actor, director, writer, DJ,
programmer, researcher, and entrepeneur.&nbsp; And he's sorry that she

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A protocol that uses steganography to circumvent
network level censorship.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many trivial techniques are
already available for circumventing firewalls and proxy servers that monitor
or censor network traffic -- for example, if your firewall blocks CNN,
someone could set up an unblocked site outside the firewall where you can
type "http://www.cnn.com/" into a form and retrieve the page contents.&nbsp;
The problem with these "protocols" is that they make it easy to get caught,
if the censors know what to look for -- for example, a GET or POST form
field containing "http://" is trivially easy to detect.&nbsp; Even an encrypted
protocol would still be easy for censors to detect, without breaking the
encryption -- just the fact that you're *using* a tool for circumventing
the censors would often be enough to get you in trouble.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What we have designed is
a protocol that uses steganography to circumvent network-level censorship,
so that the protocol is undetectable to censors.&nbsp; We explain why some
naive solutions to the problem -- such as hiding information in a long,
dynamically-generated URL which is sent to an outside "friendly" site,
or hiding information in cookies -- are not steganographically secure.&nbsp;
Our protocol hides information in "innocent-looking" text queries that
pass through the censoring proxy undetected.&nbsp; The page contents are
encrypted and embedded in more "innocent-looking" content that is sent
back to the browser.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This sounds simple, but the
mathematics of using steganography to make a protocol *undetectable* turn
out to be infuriatingly complicated.&nbsp; Much of the talk will be devoted
to attacks against the system that we didn't consider the first time around,
and why more naive solutions may fall to these attacks.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In days gone by, microprocessors
dealt in units of 8-bits at a time, and names such as Commodore, Atari,
and Apple (as in "Apple ][") ruled the land.&nbsp; Intrepid hackers of
amazing skill and talent worked their magic with limited resources, producing
code that was a thing of beauty.&nbsp; The days of the widespread 8-bit
desktop computer are past, but the 8-bit processor itself is not gone.&nbsp;
It has gotten faster, added some peripherals and picked up some of the
architectural features of it's larger later siblings, largely lost it's
external memory, and gone into hiding as the ubiquitous microcontroller
at the heart of embedded systems too numerous to count. Microcontrollers
offer an excellent opportunity to recapture that spirit of the late 70's
when 1K of code was a lot, while working with modern day technology.&nbsp;
In this one hour talk, Phil King will describe how to set up a microcontroller
development environment on a hacker budget and use it to learn and develop
nifty 8-bit embedded system toys.&nbsp; The talk will be framed by descriptions
of building an embedded keyboard sniffer with an Atmel AVR family microcontroller.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The USAFA Cadet Hacking Case:&nbsp; What
both sides should learn about computer forensics</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Basically I'll discuss the
case that went to trial in the spring of 99.&nbsp; I was the Deputy Head
of the Computer Science Department at the USAF Academy at the time and
was asked by the cadet accused of "hacking" to help with his defense.&nbsp;
I testified at the trial as an expert witness for the Defense.&nbsp; I
sat at the Defense table throughout the trial serving as their "computer
expert".&nbsp; Basically the trial was a comedy of errors by the prosecution.
law enforcement, and the cadet's attorneys alike.&nbsp; The cadet was involved
in IRC but the law enforcement types and prosecution became convinced that
he was the "hacker" (afterall, everybody KNOWS that IRC is nothing more
than a place for hackers to trade information on how to break into computers
-- the actual sentiment expressed by the investigators).&nbsp; I had up
to that point spent the majority of my time in the Air Force trying to
protect systems and to catch those who broke into AF systems.&nbsp; This
case really shook me as I saw the LE types latch onto the smallest of indicators
and blow them into a full blown felony case (the cadet faced 15 years in
Leavenworth had he been convicted of all counts).&nbsp; What I will cover
in the talk is:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>1)</b>&nbsp; Background
of the case <b>2)</b>&nbsp; The "evidence" the prosecution thought they
had <b>3)</b>&nbsp; The many possible areas where clues might have been
found had either side known where to look (or asked anybody who knew anything
about it) <b>4)</b>&nbsp; What lessons can be learned from this case.&nbsp;
Those from the government and industry need to know where to look if they
want to catch folks (and if they want to make sure they don't make fools
of themselves) and those who might find themselves accused someday need
to know how to help their attorneys find clues that could exonerate them.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Proactive Defense Against Malicious Code</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Anti-virus software is an
important part of a well-devised security policy, but reactive virus detection
is not versatile enough for the demands that will be made on businesses
engaged in e-commerce. The year 1999 began with the birth of the Happy
99 virus - a harbinger of things to come. Happy 99, plus Melissa, PrettyPark
and the Explore.zip worm are all examples of third generation of malicious
replicating code, designed to exploit the Internet for their rapid proliferation.
A variant of Explore.zip, called MiniZip, managed to hide itself from antiviral
utilities and spread at an amazing rate around the Internet at the end
of 1999. Such programs, which launch new malicious code attacks, create
"first strikes" against systems and networks. Allowing untrusted code to
execute on the corporate network may not be suitable for your organization.
But corporate security policies that block network executables adversely
affect the evolution of the Internet, extranet, and intranet. While no
security implementation is absolute, functionality is not achieved by disconnecting
users from the network and preventing access to programs. Therefore, proactive
defense against first-strike attacks is required today.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Almost all web sites today
contain mobile code. Many of the powerful business (ecommerce) applications
you need and use are written with mobile code. Consequently, net-enabled
malicious software is likely to increase in prevalence and successful utilization.
The factors accounting for such a prediction are the ease by which users
are duped into double-clicking on malicious e-mail attachments and, the
ease by which the sources of those e-mails are automatically spoofed to
seem to come from a boss or from an e-mail or instant message friend. Traditional
pattern matching approaches are incomplete, out-of-date, and ineffective
and were never designed in preventing a series of new generation attacks
based on malicious mobile code and Trojan executables.</font></font>

from Def Con 1 - when sixty real hackers met in face-time for the first
time to Def Con 8 when thousands crowd into a hotel for a hacking "event
scene." Richard Thieme has been called a "shrewd observer of hacker attitudes
and behaviors" and sometimes he is. You be the judge. In this talk he reviews
*very subjectively* the way truth is invented, perception managed, and
media manipulated in the many rings of Def Con. It's all here - the familiar
icons of good and evil, enemies of the people, Feds in disguise, happy
and unhappy hackers, and his take on the truths, half-truths and outright
lies that we exchange as currency in this looking-glass world.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Thieme's predictions at DefCon
IV in "Hacking as Practice for TransPlanetary Life in the 21st Century"
have all come to pass. But what's next? Hear how to position yourself for
the Next Big Thing, depending on your hacking&nbsp; generation and the
degree of real larceny in your heart.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Virus Writers: The End of The Innocence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Earlier research has empirically
demonstrated the cyclic nature of virus writing activity: As virus writers
age out, new virus writers take their places; enhanced connectivity amplifies
the existing problem and various technical factors result in new types
of virus writers surfacing and the cycles repeat. However, a new variable
has recently been introduced into the cycle: legal intervention.&nbsp;
The virus writing community now has experienced visits by concerned law
enforcement; there have been arrests and sentencings. New laws are being
enacted, and acted upon. Thus, the virus writing scene is no longer a casual
game of kids on local BBS.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What has been the impact
(perceptually and operationally) of these visits, arrests, and most importantly,
the (yet to be imposed) sentencing of David Smith. In other words, as the
virus problem gets more and more attention, where are we actually going
in terms of shaping acceptable behavior in our virtual communities and
what, if any, impact are these legal interventions having on the impact
of viruses impacting users ?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In order to produce a scientifically
meaningful answer to this question, this pre and post-test study examines
pre-sentencing opinions of the impact of the visits/arrests/sentencing
and compares these findings with those from post-sentencing opinions.&nbsp;
Opinions are interesting and must be considered, as we know the opinions
of today shape how people behave in the future.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>However, we are also concerned
with immediate impact. To this end, impact will be examined in terms of
viruses found both ItW and on the WWW, as a function of time with parameters
being pre/post sentencing. In particular, we are interested in any discontinuity
noted in the graph of viruses both ItW and on the WWW, and in online references
to legal concerns.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The conclusions will obviously
depend on the actual results, but there appear to be essentially one of
two scenarios:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>i. The pre and post tests
studies will demonstrate significant differences. Thus, proponents of tough
police follow-up of virus writers will have some hard evidence that this
actually has a financial value, as well as a societal impact.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>ii. The pre and post test
studies will demonstrate no appreciable difference.&nbsp; This means that
we need to re-evaluate the worth of pursuing virus writers as a useful
way of curbing the problem and evaluate the wisdom of spending large amounts
of public funding to pursue this avenue of defense.</font></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Based on RedHat Linux, users

also runs multiple firewalls, gateways, routers, VPNs, or any other network
device.&nbsp; Security experts (or hackers) can create a virtual network,
populate it with Windows systems and then attack them with the latest exploits.&nbsp;
In addition, all packet traffic can be (sniffed) sent to a file or displayed
in real time.&nbsp; This provides security experts with detailed information
about the nuts and bolts exchanges between networked computers.&nbsp; Thus,
software-programming flaws can be identified and exploited.&nbsp; In addition,
the system is a outstanding platform to create and test the most twisted
of viruses.&nbsp; The kicker is you can build a virus, instantly infect
a networked os, and then rapidly see the results.&nbsp; If it doesn't work
correctly, within seconds you can restore the infected windows os to a
virgin state, modify the virus, and try it again.</font></font>

found that the sites we took down would come back up after a few days or

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>"Like
a paranoid version of pin the tail on the donkey, the favorite sport at
this gathering of computer hackers and phone phreaks seems to be hunting

- John Markhoff, NYT</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>Basically
the contest goes like this:&nbsp; If you see some shady MIB (Men in Black)
earphone penny loafer sunglass wearing Clint Eastwood to live and die in
LA type lurking about, point him out.&nbsp; Just get my attention and claim
out loud you think you have spotted a fed.&nbsp; The people around at the
time will then (I bet) start to discuss the possibility of whether or not
a real fed has been spotted.&nbsp; Once enough people have decided that
a fed has been spotted, and the Identified Fed (I.F.) has had a say, and
informal vote takes place, and if enough people think it's a true fed,
or fed wanna-be, or other nefarious style character, you win a "I spotted
the fed!" shirt, and the I.F. gets an "I am the fed!" shirt.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>NOTE
TO THE FEDS:&nbsp; This is all in good fun, and if you survive unmolested
and undetected, but would still secretly like an "I am the fed!" shirt
to wear around the office or when booting in doors, please contact me when
no one is looking and I will take your order(s).&nbsp; Just think of all
the looks of awe you'll generate at work wearing this shirt while you file
away all the paperwork you'll have to produce over this convention.&nbsp;
I won't turn in any feds who contact me, they have to be spotted by others.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1><i>DOUBLE
SECRET NOTE TO FEDS</i>:&nbsp; This year I am printing up extra "I am the
Fed!" shirts, and will be trading them for coffee mugs,&nbsp; shirts or
baseball hats from your favorite TLA.&nbsp; If you want to&nbsp; swap bring
along some goodies and we can trade.&nbsp; Be stealth about it if you don't
want people to spot you.&nbsp; Agents from foreign governments are welcome
to trade too, but I gotta work on my mug collection and this is the fastest

(CTF) contest:</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Capture the Flag
(CTF) contest - Time to dust off those sniffers and shine those 'sploits,
because CTF is back with a vengeance.&nbsp; This year many of the rules
and goals have changed to refocus participants on the fun involved, as
well as make the event more relevant to a real world hacking situation.&nbsp;
So pay attention to the changes, this will be on the final exam.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>The
Players:</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1><b>1)
The Bastard Operators from HELL (BOFH) -</b> The people who want to be
on the BOFH side have to either set up a bastion host, or a firewall with
an unhardened host behind it. The hosts have to be running useful services
and have user accounts. If you set up a host you should be able to point
to it and say "that's a mail host" or "warez site" or a Shoutcast server,
etcetera.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>Registration
of Servers will be required to obtain an IP address.&nbsp; Be prepared
to provide the Judges a hard copy of the configuration of the machine.&nbsp;
(Box, OS, Patches, Services running &amp; bound ports.)&nbsp; Persons found
to be connecting unregistered servers will not be allowed to join the competition.&nbsp;
Please remember to to label your box with your name and contact info, as
this will speed things up considerably.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>Judging
will be based on the number and type of services and whether the host is
compromised.&nbsp; So the more services the better, just make sure you
lock 'em down.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1><b>2)
The (L)USERS -</b> Anybody who wants to should be able to walk up to an
admin and ask them for an account on their host. What the admin gives you
depends on the type of server they set up. The account should be enough
to actually get mail from the mail server, play quake on the quake server,
etc.&nbsp; Lusers can't win; they just get to use the servers.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1><b>3)
The Hackers -</b> Hackers win by putting their team name or handle in a
file in the root directory of any host on the network. To count, the file
has to stay there long enough for a designated Judge to verify it.&nbsp;
Whatever hacker or team racks up the greatest number of hosts wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additional points will be awarded for speed and efficiency.&nbsp; Hack
fast, Hack well.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>The
Rules:&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>1)
Everyone must register as a participant in order to obtain an IP address.&nbsp;
If you're wondering if this means you, then it does.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>2)
No hacking from any network segments other than the designated one.&nbsp;
There will be no tolerance for those taking down the DEF CON network.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>3)
No taking down the CTF network or any host you didn't bring for more than
60 seconds.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>4)
No taking down a host you did bring for more than 5 minutes.&nbsp; That's
just dirty pool.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>5)
Physically accessing any server after it is put into operation will result
in a disqualification for that person.&nbsp; Administration may only be
performed via the LAN.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>6)
If your mail host doesn't run any mail protocol known to man we laugh at
you, spit in your jolt &amp; you don't win.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>7)
Points for style. Admins and hackers get prizes based on how stylish their
host/hack is. Points will be taken away from you if you do stupid DOS attacks.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>8)
No thuggery, summoning of elder gods/ Mickey Finns/ physical coercion.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>9)
Obey the Goons, they exist for your protection.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>The
preceding information is liable to change.&nbsp; Upon set-up of CTF, please
request a current hard copy of the rules from Ghent or any member of the
NOC staff.&nbsp; Enjoy!</font></font></font></td>

written by our guest host, David Marconi and starring Will Smith and Gene
Hackman among others.&nbsp; The audience is invited to discuss the movie
and some of the scenes with the writer.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Enemy of the State</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The murder of a congressman
is caught on tape and Robert Dean (Will Smith) has it. He has to save his
family career and life all in 2 hours! Although the plot twists aren't
always surprising they are convincing. Gene Hackman plays the role of the
paranoid informant wonderfully but Will Smith can't help being funny no
matter how hard he tries. Tony Scott shows the action from surveillance
camera and telephoto angles giving an edgy feeling throughout the picture.
Most of the chases are on foot keeping car chases are kept to a minimum.
The story moves along at a good speed making it a good action movie with
a solid plot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#CCCCCC"><font size=-1>David
Marconi is a Hollywood writer and Director.&nbsp; He has worked the film
scene in TV as well as movies since the early 80's.&nbsp; His credits include
