Lies and Computer Crimes: The Truth Behind The Indictment Of "Computer
Genius" Christopher Schanot</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>On March 25, 1996 Christopher
Schanot was arrested based on an 11 day old warrant which stemmed from
an indictment in Missouri for five counts of computer and access fraud
involving Bellcore, SRI, Sprint and Southwestern Bell.&nbsp; Although he
was not indicted for crimes involving the Internet Libertaion Front, the
FBI lied and claimed in print that Schanot supposedly confessed to this.
The prosecution also claims Schanot cost Southwestern Bell $500,000 damage
to secure themselves after Christopher entered their system and that Southwestern
Bell is supposedly now hacker proof. They claim Schanot was a co-conspirator
in crimes against Southwestern Bell involving people Christopher never
knew or even spoke to and involving over a dozen hackers and phreaks who
haven't been arrested and others who haven't even been raided or questioned.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At the time of his arrest
Schanot, 19, was living with the woman he was dating, Netta Gilboa, 38,
who is the publisher of</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>*Gray
Areas* magazine (http://www.gti.net/grayarea&nbsp; - Christopher designed
the web page and also wrote reviews for it). The FBI has admitted both
in court and in press reports that Schanot committed no crimes during the
time he lived with Gilboa, but the bust was a result of Schanot's father
calling in the FBI to supposedly help find his runaway son. Although Gilboa
was not questioned, raided or arrested, *Gray Areas* magazine as well as
Gilboa's life and character have been the subject of both court testimony
and dozens of erroneous media reports. Gilboa and Schanot have not spoken
out until today and although the case is still ongoing which restricts
many juicy details, as much as possible will be said to try to correct
the media reports, expose the father, Mike Schanot, for stalking, and to
condemn everyone involved from the prosecution to the feds to fellow hackers.
Extensive presence of both federal agents from *every* possible agency
and media is expected at this particular speech as the case is both sensational
and ongoing. For this reason, in order to protect Christopher Schanot's
legal rights and privacy, as well as to prevent more charges or accusations
against him, there will be no questions or comments allowed from the audience
during this speech. Persons wishing to have a specific question answered
about the case can either ask Gilboa in advance or after the speech. On
the bright side, this expected abundance of feds will result in many more
opportunities to win an infamous "I Spotted The Fed" T-shirt.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Christopher is requesting
that hackers do not speak to the media about him and is asking that donations
to help him be sent care of Gray Areas Inc. (PO Box 808 Broomall PA 19008).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Netta Gilboa is arguably
the person who has gotten the furthest in the computer underground without
ever committing crimes herself.&nbsp; She is also possibly the person in
the scene questioned the most times ever by law enforcement simply for
the crime of talking to hackers. Gilboa is the publisher of the award winning
publication *Gray Areas* (http://www.gti.net/grayarea) and is the author
of "Elites, Lamers, Narcs and Whores: Exploring The Computer Underground"
which recently appeared in the Seal Press book *Wired_Women: Gender And
New Realities In Cyberspace.* She has also been published in *Phrack, Computer
underground Digest, Cult of the Dead Cat, Empire Times, Dupree's Diamond
News,* and many other paper magazines and electronic publications. Gilboa
holds an M.S. in Advertising and an M.A. in Sociology from Northwestern
University and a B.A. in Journalism from State University College of New
York at New Paltz.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Hated by some, loved and
respected by others, Gilboa seems to polarize the 1200+ hackers she has
interacted with. Gilboa is one of the few journalists to ever take the
time to get to know hackers before writing about them and to continue to
try to work with them despite severe harassment of both herself and other
people associated with *Gray Areas* magazine. Gilboa's boyfriend, Christopher
Schanot, is presently incarcerated without bail for computer crimes he
allegedly committed before meeting her. It should be noted that Christopher
trusts Netta with both his life and with his story.&nbsp; According to
the prosecution he was certainly in a position to check her out thoroughly
and decided to be with her regardless of the consequences.&nbsp; The couple
are now collaborating on a book tentatively titled *Computer Genius* which
will reveal the real inner workings of the hacking subculture and raise
questions about the feds, informants and security experts who are often
equally dirty and who allow it all to continue while they gather "information,"
hack themselves, and stay employed. Numerous Internet providers will be
evaluated for their roles in these events. It is also expected that manycurrent,
defunct and prank groups in the warez, ansi, hacking, virus and phreaking
scene such as ACID, BOW, DPAK, ICE, IIRG, ILF, INC, LOCK, LOD, MOD, NSA,
PHALCON/SKISM, NUKE, POSSE, R00T and WNOC will be explored as well. One
intention is clearly to clear the couple's names. Another is to help Christopher
gain recognition as an expert in the field. The combination of their different
perspectives of various events they each witnessed separately and together
over the years is expected to be way more powerful than any book written
by either of them alone or by some reporter who simply profiled hackers
but did not participate in the events themselves.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Although Netta Gilboa has
previously spoken everywhere from HoHoCon to PumpCon to Computers,Freedom
and Privacy, her DefCon speech will be long remembered for its guts, candid
revelations and for some of the shocking and chilling facts as well as
the glaring questions behind the "Computer Genius" case itself. Few people
arrested choose to reveal their stories so publicly.&nbsp; Don't miss it!</font></font>

think of ourselves. Redefines how we understand out possibilities for action
in the world. It's also a metaphor for new opportunities available to human
beings now and in the next century. Hacking is one way to practice living
in transplanetary society. That's why hackers are pathfinders for the next
generation. Spirituality is simply the way getting connected online translates
into new kinds of community life.</font></font>

that hackers can "outgrow their ignorance and be valuable members of the
