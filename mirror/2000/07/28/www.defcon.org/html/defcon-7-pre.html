from all over the planet.&nbsp; Well, no one from North Korea has shown
up (that we know of) but if they did I'm sure we would convince them to

how to hack in a weekend, but what we are trying to do is create an environment
where you can hang out with people from all different backgrounds. All
of them interested in the same thing, computer security.&nbsp; To do this
we have taken over the complete hotel at the Alexis Park Resort.&nbsp;

to form solutions without thinking.&nbsp; For example, the Critical Infrastructure
Assurance Office (CIAO), formed by a Presidential Directive to help protect
the Critical Infrastructure, was considering a plan to recruit a group

Info Warriors of the future.</font></font></font>

TEXTFILES, G-PHILES, AND LOG FILES: Remembering the 1980's Through ASCII</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In the 1980's, life started
to move online, bringing with it all the wonder, terror, and breadth of
human nature.&nbsp; Most markedly, an entire generation of teenagers turned
their energies and efforts onto this growing culture and turned the world
of Bulletin Board Systems into a combination street corner and clubhouse,
sharing their knowledge, lying and bragging into infamy, and&nbsp; creating
a shared experience that lasts in their hearts and minds to this day as
they become the foundation of the Internet Society.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>While the unique forces that
combined to make BBSes the experience they were have since shifted and
formed other cultures in the years since, a feel for the 1980's can be
found in the Textfiles (also known as g-files or 'philes') that nearly
every self-respecting BBS traded, offered, or created as a matter of gaining
notoriety (and more importantly, callers) in a sea of similar voices. In
these textfiles, readers can reminisce or learn anew about what the BBS
experience meant to those who lived through it, and easy parallels can
be drawn to the 'scenes' that are now thriving online today.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This talk will attempt to
give historical perspective and narrative to the BBS 'scene' of the 1980's,
presented by a user who was around for a good portion of it and took notes.
Expect shouted refutations from the audience and eerily familiar battles
waged across the message boards to live again.</font></font>

it pays to know who we can trust. After all, we have to work in "trusted

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>2) Port probes that are

and suspicious user activity.</font></font>

the media has this annoying habit of getting things wrong, at least from
a hacker's point of view. Mainstream reporters feel the same way -- hacking
is cool, sexy, and guarantees readership. But hackers are so evasive, way
too full of themselves, and then there's this godawful technology to try
to understand. How can reporters and hackers work together, or at least
understand each other?</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Brian
Ristuccia's Anti-Censorship Proxy (ACP) is a tool for circumventing network-level
Internet censorship.&nbsp; It combines functionality of older software
such as PGP, Anonymizer, and steganography software, enabling Internet
users to bypass firewalls and proxy servers without detection. ACP can
be used to circumvent firewalls used by China and Saudi Arabia to block
criticism of their governments, or to bypass software used in American
schools to censor pages about contraception, animal rights, and many non-Christian
religions.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>These
countries and institutions are likely to crack down on the use of such
software, provoking an "arms race" between ACP developers and their opponents.&nbsp;
(The use of strong encryption in ACP may even conflict with some countries'
import/export regulations.)&nbsp; This talk will describe the ACP and look
at some of the directions that such an "arms race" might take, as well
as describing real-world implementations of network-level censorship (in
China, Serbia, the Middle East, as well as many U.S. schools), what kind
of content is censored, and how the ACP could be used to bypass these restrictions.&nbsp;

- John Markhoff, NYT</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>Basically
the contest goes like this:&nbsp; If you see some shady MIB (Men in Black)
earphone penny loafer sunglass wearing Clint Eastwood to live and die in
LA type lurking about, point him out.&nbsp; Just get my attention and claim
out loud you think you have spotted a fed.&nbsp; The people around at the
time will then (I bet) start to discuss the possibility of whether or not
a real fed has been spotted.&nbsp; Once enough people have decided that
a fed has been spotted, and the Identified Fed (I.F.) has had a say, and
informal vote takes place, and if enough people think it's a true fed,
or fed wanna-be, or other nefarious style character, you win a "I spotted
the fed!" shirt, and the I.F. gets an "I am the fed!" shirt.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>NOTE
TO THE FEDS:&nbsp; This is all in good fun, and if you survive unmolested
and undetected, but would still secretly like an "I am the fed!" shirt
to wear around the office or when booting in doors, please contact me when
no one is looking and I will take your order(s).&nbsp; Just think of all
the looks of awe you'll generate at work wearing this shirt while you file
away all the paperwork</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>you'll
have to produce over this convention.&nbsp; I won't turn in any feds who
contact me, they have to be spotted by others.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1><i>DOUBLE
SECRET NOTE TO FEDS</i>:&nbsp; This year I am printing up extra "I am the
Fed!" shirts, and will be trading them for coffee mugs,&nbsp; shirts or
baseball hats from your favorite TLA.&nbsp; If you want to&nbsp; swap bring
along some goodies and we can trade.&nbsp; Be stealth about it if you don't
want people to spot you.&nbsp; Agents from foreign governments are welcome
to trade too, but I gotta work on my mug collection and this is the fastest
way.</font></font></font>

- <font color="#999999">The question still remains, can anyone stand up
to the power of Team SNI?&nbsp; The playing field is a 10bT ethernet segment
with 3 groups on it.</font></font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1><i>1)
The Bastard Operators from HELL(BOFH) -</i>&nbsp; folks who want to be
on the BOFH side have to either set up a bastion host, or a firewall with
an unhardened host behind it. The hosts have to be running useful services
&amp; have user accounts. If you set up a host you should be able to point
to it and say "that's a mailhost" or "warez site" or quake/Icecast server,
etc. BOFHs win by running the coolest services and getting hacked the least.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1><i>2)
The (L)USERS -</i> Anybody who wants to should be able to walk up to an
admin and ask them for an account on their host. What the admin gives you
depends on the type of server they set up. The account should be enough
to actually get mail from the mail server, play quake on the quake server,
etc.&nbsp; Lusers can't win, they just get to use the servers.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1><i>3)
The hackers.</i> nuff said. - Hackers win by putting their team name or
handle in a file in the root directory of any host on the network. To count,
the file has to stay there long enough for a goon to verify it.&nbsp; Whatever
hacker or team racks up the greatest number of hosts wins.&nbsp; (how can
you tell the users from the hackers? If you figure that out, talk to me.&nbsp;
I've got a job for you)</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>The
rules:</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>1)
No taking down the network or any host you didn't bring for more than 60
seconds.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>2)
no taking down a host you did bring for more than 5 minutes.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>3)
If your mail host doesn't run any mail protocol known to man we laugh at
you, spit in your jolt &amp; you don't win.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>4)
10 points for style. Admins and hackers get prizes based on how stylish
their host/hack is. Points will be taken away from you if you do stupid
DOS attacks. (*clever* DOS attacks (if there is such a thing) could *win*
you points)</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>5)

is known for its extravagant shows. <font color="#999999">An unofficial
group of DefCon attendees invite you to join us for the Cirque du Soleil's
production of "O" on Friday July 9, 1999 at 730 PM at the brand new Balagio
Resort Hotel and Casino. Tickets are $100 per person in advance.&nbsp;
Last year, DefCon's culturally elite, including A.J. Effin ReznoR, Richard
Theime, Krystalia and Wyle Wade banded together to see the Cirque's production
"Mystere" at Treasure Island. The show was incredible and left all of us
amazed. This year the overwhelming majority, as surveyed on dc-stuff, recommended
the Cirque's production of "O".</font></font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#999999"><font size=-1>Beyond
circus, beyond theatre, the world acclaimed Cirque du Soleil creates an
entirely original form of live entertainment. With an international cast
of 74, performing in, on and above water "O" is an $8 million dollar state
of the art experience which includes a 1.5 million-gallon water pool as
a stage, a live orchestra, and fire! Add a large group of hackers and you
get a Las Vegas experience to remember.</font></font></font>
