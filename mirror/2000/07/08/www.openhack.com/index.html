From June 26, 2000 to July 21, 2000, eWEEK (formerly PC Week) set up a number
of servers as a challenge, to see if the servers could be compromised in one
of four specific ways.  According to the rules, this was not a successful
compromise; however, it -was- a defacement, so Attrition has mirrored it.

This is the second time their challenge has been beat. The first occured on
00.07.03. <a href="/mirror/attrition/2000/07/03/www.openhack.com/">Mirror of first</a>.
