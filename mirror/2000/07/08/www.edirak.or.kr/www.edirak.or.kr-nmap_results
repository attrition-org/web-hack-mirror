Interesting ports on www.edirak.or.kr (210.124.100.2):
Port       State       Service
80/tcp     open        http                    

TCP Sequence Prediction: Class=trivial time dependency
                         Difficulty=4 (Trivial joke)
Remote operating system guess: Windows NT4 / Win95 / Win98
