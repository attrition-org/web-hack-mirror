<BLOCKQUOTE>Reasons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</B></I></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>The Kashmir issue, the most controversial issue in the history of humanity. Everyday, the Indians Slaughter countless mujahideen, rape, torture and execute innocent women and children. What for? What gives the bloody Indians the right to violate human rights in such a manner? The Indians have violated all norms of acceptable wartime conflict and have not been reprimanded for their actions. There have been repeated attempts to advocate free elections to let hte people choose their destiny but the Indians have suppressed all these with hostile intervention and the murder of innocent civilians. Why must we bear such atrocities? All over the world, the Muslims have been targeted and systematically eliminated. Kashmir, Palestine, Bosnia... what gives \anyone the right to try and eradicate a people different from themselves? And what has the US done to prevent this? Nothing. The US has always seen itself as the moderating power of the world but it has supported Israel in its cause and has remained silent on the Kashmir Issue for Too long. A Must we remind everyone that almost al l the people in the world is owned by the Muslims? Is that why the US kisses Saudia Arabia's ass while committing such injustices deep inside? And they call Pakistan a corrupt country? Just how fucking corrupt can you get when the President of hte most powerful nation in the world gets a blowjob from an intern working in his office??? We have suffered throughout the ages and will suffer no more. This is the era of cyberwarfare, where once again the Muslims have prevailed. We will not rest till every node, every line, every bit of information contained in our suppressors has not been wiped out, returning them to the dark ages. Well will not tolerate anymore, and we will not fail. As I type this from the confront of my home... far away in a valley the blood of innocents paints the mountains red....</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On several occasions we were emailed and asked why did we hack the various site, Ok we are doing this to create global awareness of what is happening in INDIA, and we hope we would get help, We are sorry if we offended ANYONE, or if any one was hurt with any of our comments, graphical material used. here are some facts of Kashmir.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>For the vast majority of time since 1947, the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir pursued non-violent methods to get the referendum held. The Kashmiri people are now fighting to implement what has been promised to them. They want to come out of the physiological limbo of not knowing if they are Indian, Pakistani or Kashmir. They want the matter sorted once and for all. </P>
</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>It is high time to sort this </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4 COLOR="#c0c0c0">issue</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4> out for the following reasons:</P>
</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Over 50,000 Kashmiri's have been killed since 1990.</P>
<P>Over 1,000 Indian army people have been killed since 1990. </P>
<P>Its time India lived up to its promises. </P>
<P>The whole of South Asia is unstable due to this problem, especially now that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers. Two great nations namely Pakistan and India have to spend enormous amount of money on their armed forces because of this problem. When India and Pakistan takes 5 steps forward the Kashmir issue takes them back 6 steps. There has never been a better time to sort this problem. The cold war has ended, we are at the dawn of the 21st century and the potential consequences of not sorting it out are two high to contemplate. Neither Pakistan, India nor Kashmir will win in the war, especially if it goes nuclear. </P>
