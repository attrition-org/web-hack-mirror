        THE DETAILS<br>
        Authorities are seeking information in connection with the mysterious disappearance of a juvenile female, Michelle Lois Prasek, on December 19, 1997. Prasek was reportedly last seen by her mother in their home near The Woodlands, Texas, less than an hour before she was to leave home to get on a bus for school. Prasek may have been on the school premises that day, but she did not attend classes. The next day Prasek's mother reported her missing to local authorities in Montgomery County, Texas.<br>
        <br>
        REMARKS<br>
        Michelle Prasek was last seen wearing a tan T-shirt with the initials CK, blue jeans, and Nike tennis shoes. A few of Prasek's other personal belongings were also missing from her home.<br>
        <br>
        Prasek has had no prior history of running away and no trouble with the law or school. She was a good student academically. Prasek's parents are divorced and, prior to her disappearance, she was looking forward to spending the Christmas holidays with her father in Kingsville, Texas.<br>
        <br>
        Prasek has an interest in cats and has a cat for a pet. She enjoys reading books, particularly horror stories.<br>
        <br>
        REWARD<br>
        The FBI is offering a reward for information leading to Michelle Prasek's whereabouts.<br>
        <br>
        individuals with information concerning this case should take no action themselves, but instead immediately contact the nearest FBI Office or local law enforcement agency. For any possible sighting outside the United States, contact the nearest United States Embassy or Consulate.</p>

        <p align="center">Let me tell you a story.<br>
        <br>
        A guy, a little over twenty accidently drives over a elderly woman and her grandchild of ten.<br>
        During police investigation, it turns out that the guy was drunk when he drove his car.<br>
        The guy goes free because of some stupid technicality that his lawyer finds.<br>
        Two weeks later he commits suicide and leaves a note:&nbsp;<br>
        Forgive me for sins done.<br>
        <br>
        All because he was drunk.<br>
        <br>
        There are no excuses, only facts. Drinking sucks, enjoying a drink doesn't.<br>
        There are no excuses, only facts. During the Eurocup 2000, people were served low alcohol drinks because they
        didn't want everybody to get drunk so fast.<br>
        There are no excuses, only facts.<br>
