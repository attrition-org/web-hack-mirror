</b></font><font face="Arial">

<p>The schools of the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville are excellent places to
learn. Time and proper assistance are provided so that all students are expected to learn
and do learn at very high levels.</p>

<p>Each school provides an orderly environment with rules, values, high expectations,
caring, and commitment that together create a healthy family-type atmosphere. All school
personnel care; they model the obligation and desire to teach; and they promote the
academic and personal success of each student.</p>

<p>As importantly, parents participate in the education of their children, and their
active and supportive involvement is continually sought.</p>
