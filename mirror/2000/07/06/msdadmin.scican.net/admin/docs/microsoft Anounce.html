<p align="CENTER">Work at Home Rights Back for some Office Products</p>
</b></font>

<p>For Microsoft products of Office and Office Professional full suite only,</p>

<p>Publisher, Project, and Front Page licensed through Open (MOLP) or Select,</p>

<p>education customers now have the right to use these products on either a</p>

<p>home or portable computer. Effective immediately, the primary user of a</p>

<p>computer on which a copy of the software is installed may make a second copy</p>

<p>on either a home or portable computer for work-related purposes.</p>

<p>Microsoft has decided to reinstate work at home in education only because of</p>

<p>the non-typical working environment of the teacher/faculty member. Most</p>

<p>teacher/faculty members do not have an office per se and execute most of</p>

<p>their work from home.</p>

<p>For select customers that have purchased any of the products above, a letter</p>

<p>will be sent to them stating that they are now entitled to work at home</p>

<p>privileges provided they date and sign the letter. By signing and dating</p>

<p>letter, the customer acknowledges and agrees to the change in their select</p>

<p>product use rights. Customers need to sign and date letter and then return</p>

<p>it to Microsoft by May 31. These letters will be sent the week of April 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For open customers that have previously purchased any of the above software,</p>

<p>they will not receive a letter, but will be entitled to work at home rights</p>

<p>immediately. These customers will be informed via newsletters and various</p>

<p>other communication methods.</p>
