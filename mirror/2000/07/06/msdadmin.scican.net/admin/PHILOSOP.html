<p align="JUSTIFY">METROPOLITAN SCHOOL DISTRICT OF MARTINSVILLE</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">EDUCATION PHILOSOPHY</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that our schools should strive for excellence in all
that they do.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that the school climate should be one of trust, respect,
and security. There should be open, candid communication.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that each student is unique and that the school
corporation's purpose is to develop the unique potential of each student. Therefore, the
Metropolitan School District of Martinsville in cooperation with parents and other
community institutions, directs all activities, curricular and co-curricular, toward
promoting the maximum intellectual, emotional, physical, social, aesthetic, and moral
development of each student.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that each student should be motivated to succeed in
school and that the desire to learn is accentuated when learning experiences are
stimulating and non-threatening.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that all students need success to prosper. Success
breeds success; and a positive self-image is paramount to proper development. A proper
school climate should be flexible and divergent enough to allow each person to have some
measure of success regularly.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that rote learning of facts is important only to the
degree that they become the building blocks for concepts and processes. Developing the
ability to solve problems whether social, mathematical, or economic should be given
preference. Students should experience regular opportunities for rigorous analytical
thinking which involves planning, applying, validating, and evaluating in all curricular
areas commensurate with their ability and maturity. They should develop a sense of
responsibility for their own learning.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that students need teachers of vision, empathy, and
ability who are committed to helping students grow into all they are capable of becoming.
The teacher's role should not be solely that of disseminator of knowledge but must include
the ability to establish an effective teaching/learning environment. The teacher should
help each student realize what he has learned and channel random discoveries into
systematized learning.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that education should have a humanizing effect; it
should arouse in all students a genuine concern for themselves, their peers, and other
human beings. Students should understand the value and integrity of each human life. They
should come to know themselves and develop respect and compassion for their fellow man.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that students should demonstrate love for and pride in
their country and school. They should demonstrate appreciation for the freedoms and
privileges and country, respect for the government of which they are a part, and respect
for all school and other public property.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE EXPECT</b> students to develop their moral sense so that as adults
they will be able to make principled judgments in the fact of complex and adverse
circumstances.</p>
<b>

<p align="JUSTIFY">WE BELIEVE</b> that the excellence of education is equally dependent
upon the teacher's ability to teach, the student's desire to learn, and the quality of
administrative and parental support of the teacher's task. Therefore, we pledge the
resources of the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville to the development of an
effective teaching and learning climate and each student adequate opportunities to achieve
our educational goals. </p>
