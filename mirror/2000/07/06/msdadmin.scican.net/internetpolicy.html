<p align="CENTER"><img src="desktopsmall.gif" align="BOTTOM" naturalsizeflag="3" width="48" height="46"></p>

<p>The MSD of Martinsville is pleased to provide our community with access to the
INTERNET, a worldwide electronic highway. Accessibility to the INTERNET&nbsp;is available
to school staff members in all of the Martinsville schools. Students may also access the
INTERNET at school by committing to the MSD&nbsp;of Martinsville's AUP (Acceptable Use
Policy).</p>

<p>The INTERNET&nbsp;provides a connection for our staff and students to thousands of
computers in places such as museums, NASA, schools and libraries throughout the world. A
wide variety of information is available through accessing the INTERNET. However, with
these benefits also comes the availability of material that may be considered
inappropriate to children and not of any educational value. The MSD of Martinsville will
take reasonable precautions to restrict students from these controversial areas.</p>
