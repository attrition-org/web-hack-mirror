tag... ya ya ya i know, i said i'd be changin out new <i>creative</i> designs for my tag and all the rest of that bullshit but i've been busy ok damnit? hehe, anyway you can expect something new and kickass soon hopefully, as in doing these things i look to feed the eyes with some scrumptious titilizing something or another so look for it. oh and i think i'm slowly figuring out why this kind of shit is done so often, atleast in my case.. i think that we're all a bunch of naturally wacky freaky dinky fuckin weirdos, and instead of going to public places where incoherent shit like this is usually ignored, we take it to a place where it cant be! so from now on looks like you all will be recieving a dose of my fucked up psyche on every tag.. and well if you dont like it.. <b>then dont fucking read it</b>. but dont bitch and moan at me how much you hate me because i <b>made</b> you read through my bullshit.. either ya do or ya dont, like i give a fuck less either way... but one thing i do know is you can cover alot more territory by building new bridges then breaking down others...
