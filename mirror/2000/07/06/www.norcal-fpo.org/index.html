<b>I Pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the
Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.</b>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">The flag is the
symbol of our national unity, our national endeavor, our national aspiration.<br>
The flag tells of the struggle for independence, of union preserved, of liberty
and union one and inseparable, of the sacrifices of brave men and women to whom
the ideals and honor of this nation have been dearer than life.<br>
It means America first; it means an undivided allegiance.<br>
It means America united, strong and efficient, equal to her tasks.<br>
It means that you cannot be saved by the valor and devotion of your ancestors,
that to each generation comes its patriotic duty; and that upon your willingness
to sacrifice and endure as those before you have sacrificed and endured rests
the national hope.<br>
It speaks of equal rights, of the inspiration of free institutions exemplified
and vindicated, of liberty under law intelligently conceived and impartially
administrated. There is not a thread in it but scorns self-indulgence, weakness,
and rapacity.<br>
It is eloquent of our community interests, outweighing all divergencies of
opinion, and of our common destiny.<br>
