        <p align="center">Everyday we get garbage thrown at us. In the news we read pseudo reports by people who have no clue what happens in a region, a small example: a couple of years ago a river in Holland flooded, on CNN they made it look like the half of Holland was under water. NOTE: In Holland people do not live around one frigging river. Amsterdam never got flooded by water either, just by Japanese and German tourists making 20 pictures a second.<br>

        If nobody laughed in the background on the David Letterman show, would it actually be funny? Yes? Tape it, and
        watch it when you just woke up, you won't laugh, you'll think it's stupid. NOTE: It is stupid, but because you're tired and other people laugh, you do too, you're a creature of habit.<br>
        <br>
        Ever heard a celebrity like Britney Spears sing live? Of course not, they can't. They're blown up singing dolls made to look good, and singing, well computers can do magic these days. Ever seen a picture of Britney Spears when she just woke up? Probably not huh? It's because when she gets out of bed, she looks ugly, in reality she doesn't have the pretty face you see in those video clips, it takes hours to make her look like that, so anyone who would want to be like her (girls, not guys. :)) or would want a girlfriend to look that good is going to lose that battle. But for some reason people feel crappy when they don't.<br>

        I forget where I got this from, but once I heard this (and no, it weren't voices in my head):<br>
        "I worked at a restaurant where the food was disgusting, so one day I asked the cook why the restaurant was so busy even though the food was bad and he said: if you feed people enough slop, they'll develop a taste for it"<br>
