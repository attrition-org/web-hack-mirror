<b><u>0wned</u></b> - more proof that not running the latest version of ProFTPd 
can easily get you in trouble :) Apart from that, a huge <i>fuck you</i> to the
goddamn son of a bitch on 200.213.31.238 who was synflooding the server while we
tried to get in. Bastard.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<!---
   Any scriptkiddy can synflood a server. It's *lame* and very immature. Think
   about that *before* you let your goddamn puberty mood kick in.

<center><h2>This is your wake-up call.</h2></center>
Maybe it's about time that sysadmins learn to know about the weaknesses of the
servers they are administrating. Up until now there have only been people like
ourselves hacking into this server, but what if someone one of those many many people 
who can gain access actually has malicious intent? All data on this server 
could've been wiped away in a split second.
&nbsp;<br>
Standard disclaimer: In this hack no data has been compromised, read, filtered 
or modified and no files were tampered with. Mail accounts have not been accessed 
and no backdoors or filters have been installed on the server (although we easily 
could've done that as you might have realized by now).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A simple "mv index.old.html index.html" will bring your site back the way 
it was before we entered. Oh and we took the liberty of patching the hole we used
to get in. You're welcome.<br>
