        <p align="center">Forgetting.<br>
        <br>
        I personally think forgetting things is good. Because what if we didn't forget a lot of things? I think it would really stink if we kept on remembering things we didn't want to remember, like some nasty accident we witnessed, or whatever, but sometimes, forgetting things is bad.<br>
        <br>
        We've forgotten there's a war in Afghanistan, in the Congo, white farmers are being murdered almost daily in Zimbabwe, human rights are still not being enforced in China or Turkey, Kashmir isn't in the news that much anymore and Elian's problems aren't cared about anymore.<br>
        Everyone acted like it was oh so important a little while ago, and now because CNN doesn't broadcast it anymore we don't care anymore. Kind of sad isn't it? That we are just interested or care about or show compassion with people and things in the news.<br>
        <br>
        Which raises a question: were we interested because it was in the news or because we really care?<br>
        IF we REALLY cared, why aren't we showing it anymore? The problems are still there aren't they? Why don't we do something for them then?<br>
        <br>
        The Dalai Lama is still exiled from Nepal, a country of which most people don't even know where it is, or that it even exists. And nobody cares or does anything anymore. And we're not interested.<br>
        <br>
        And you don't care about the Dalai Lama, and if you said you were interested and cared about human rights in China, the war in the Congo or the high level of crime in South-Africa, you're just a big fat liar, and you should have a look at yourself.<br>
        Are you part of a human rights movement? Probably not. You just send a check to organizations rich enough to afford a commercial. Do you actually help people? The homeless? The sick? The elderly? Give money, give your support to organizations that help in places where it's needed and nobody cares about? I doubt it, because it's not in the news, you forget, and you will be forgotten too.<br>
