         <A NAME="blevins"></A><B>Bequest Doubles OCU CD Collection,
         Brings Priceless Recordings to University</B></P>
         
         <P>For years, Oklahoma City resident Bill Blevins enjoyed
         performances by Oklahoma City University's Oklahoma
         Opera/Music Theater Company. Upon his death on May 30 this
         year, he returned the gift of music with an enormous
         collection of album and CD recordings, books, videos, scores
         and librettos.</P>
         
         <P>"What this gift has done for our library is amazing,"
         said Mark Parker, dean of the OCU School of Music. "Prior to
         receiving this gift, our CD collection numbered 500. It has
         now tripled."</P>
         
         <P>Also included in the collection are an album of "42nd
         Street" signed by the cast members, OCU alumna Leona
         Mitchell's first album and other OCU-related memorabilia.
         </P>
         
         <P>Blevins had a life-long passion for classical music and
         contributed generously to many aspiring artists and students
         of opera and musical theater. In addition to the music
         collection, the Bill Blevins Endowment is being established
         at OCU.</P>
         
         <P>Blevins was chief of pathology at Midwest City Hospital
         from 1969 until his retirement in 1998. He earned a
         bachelor's degree from Oklahoma State University and his
         medical degree from the University of Oklahoma. He also
         obtained a Ph.D. in chemistry and a Ph.D. in microbiology
         from Baylor Hospital in Texas.</P>
         
         <P><A NAME="states"></A><B>Two Students Claim State Pageant
         Titles</B></P>
         
         <P>In its 96-year history, Oklahoma City University has
         produced three Miss Americas and 27 state pageant winners.
         The University's winning tradition continues this year with
         Katherine Hill, a May 2000 OCU graduate and 1998 Miss OCU
         winning the Miss Minnesota 2000 crown; and Jill Pennington,
         an OCU graduate student in vocal performance capturing the
         Miss Nebraska 2000 title. They will compete for the Miss
         America title in October.</P>
         
         <P><B><A NAME="orchestra"></A>Symphony Orchestra Receives
         National Award</B></P>
         
         <P>For its strong commitment to the works of 20th century
         composers, the Oklahoma City University Orchestra has
         received the second place Award for Adventurous Programming
         by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers
         (ASCAP) and the American Symphony Orchestra League. The
         award was presented on June 16 at the American an Symphony
         Orchestra League's national conference in Boston, Mass.</P>
         
         <P>OCU's repertoire for the 1999-2000 season included works
         by John Adams, John Corigliano, Stephen Paulus, Christopher
         Rouse, Michael Torks, Joseph Schwantner and Ellen Taaffe
         Zwilich. Mark Parker, dean of the Margaret E. Petree College
         of Music and Performing Arts' School of Music and the
         Orchestra's director, explained that the season was
         conceived as a celebration to usher in the year 2000.</P>
         
         <P>"The OCU Symphony Orchestra has made a commitment to
         music of living composers," Parker said. "We have often
         premiered music of the University's past
         Composer-in-Residence Ray Luke and our current
         Composer-in-Residence Edward Knight. The Orchestra looks
         forward to readings of new works by student composers, as
         well as professional composers."</P>
         
         <P>OCU competed against outstanding schools from across the
         nation, including the Manhattan School of Music, the first
         place winner; and Yale, which took third place.</P>
         
         <P>"Students in OCU's Symphony Orchestra, while trained in
         the classics, receive an extensive education in music of our
         time," Parker said. "The students are not the only ones who
         benefit from this exposure to so much of today's music.
         While many university orchestras are lucky to have 100
         people in the audience at any given concert, the audience at
         OCU regularly numbers over 350."</P>
         
         <P><B><A NAME="jones"></A>Stars Name New Women's Basketball
         Coach</B></P>
         
         <P>Janell Jones has been named the head women's basketball
         coach at Oklahoma City University. The university conducted
         a nationwide search and selected Jones after interviewing a
         number of candidates.</P>
         
         <P>Jones has been an assistant coach at OCU the last two
         seasons, in which the Stars won back-to-back NAIA National
         Championships. Prior to that, she was an assistant coach at
         Oral Roberts University, and was a successful high school
         coach at Midwest City Carl Albert. While at Carl Albert, her
         team won the Class 5A State Championship and Jones coached
         Page Sauer, who is now playing in the WNBA.</P>
         
         <P>"I'm excited to have the opportunity to continue working
         with the great group of players that we have at OCU," Jones
         said. "We have an outstanding nucleus of returning veterans
         and some exciting new recruits that will help us sustain the
         accomplishments of the past two years."</P>
         
         <P>OCU returns four players who started during the two
         championship seasons. Two Oklahoma All-State selections,
         Millwood's Kiesha Watson and Carl Albert's Sara Kincannon,
         have already signed to play for OCU next season.</P>
         
         <P>"We believe Janell has been a major part of the success
         of our program the past two seasons and we're confident that
         she will continue to lead OCU to prominence in the future,"
         said athletic director Dr. Joseph "Bud" Sahmaunt.</P>
         
         <P><B><A NAME="fte"></A>Three OCU Students Receive FTE
         Fellowships</B></P>
         
         <P>Three Oklahoma City University students are among 37
         undergraduate students in the United States selected to
         receive Partnership for Excellence Fellowships from the Fund
         for Theological Education</P>
         
         <P>Students Stephanie Hughes-Tremper of Oklahoma City,
         Jeanne Pate of Altus, Okla., and Peggy Risenhoover of
         Norman, Okla., were selected for their superior academic
         achievement and exceptional gifts for ministry.</P>
         
         <P>As fellows, they will receive a monetary award and
         continued support by FTE as they determine whether to pursue
         theological education in preparation for ministry. The
         program is designed to encourage their formation as
         ministers for the churches.</P>
         
         <P><B><A NAME="dance"></A>OCU Dance Alumni Selected for
         International Competition</B></P>
         
         <P>Four of the 24 finalists for the 2000 Leo's Jazz Dance

         City University School of American Dance &amp; Arts
         Management. They are Rick Twombley, Beth Dukleth, Lauren
         Gaul and Kim McCollum.</P>
         
         <P>"Considering the international scope and prestige of the
         competition, I am very pleased at the high representation
         that our graduates have among the finalists," said John
         Bedford, dean of the OCU dance school. "I credit the dance
         faculty for providing dance majors with exposure to top
         choreography while they are students, giving them a firm
         foundation on which to develop their abilities."</P>
         
         <P>The 2000 Leo's Jazz Dance Choreography Competition will
         take place August 2-6 at the University at Buffalo, New
         York. Gold, Silver and Bronze Leos, along with cash prizes,
         will be awarded.</P>

         during the Jazz Dance World Congress, August 2-6, in the
         Center for the Arts, University at Buffalo, New York. A
         distinguished jury will choose the winners of the three Leo
         awards.</P>
