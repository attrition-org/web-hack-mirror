Weed was a lamer now his shit is mine. As for weed ... I don't think you'll be seeing him for quite some time. The only thing of his is the rebellion. In his death I will continue it.  - The Rebellion - RANCID -<br>

<u>In sane?</u><br>
What does it mean to be sane? To follow society's rules and guidlines. To not be yourself but be manipulated into what society wants you to be... so it can hide all its flaws and act like everything is ok? I'm not insane... Society is insane.<BR>
