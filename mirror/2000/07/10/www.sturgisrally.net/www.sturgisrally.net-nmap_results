Starting nmap V. 2.50 by fyodor@insecure.org ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (2), OS detection will be MUCH less reliable
Interesting ports on vdomains.enetis.net (206.31.204.100):
Port       State       Service
80/tcp     open        http                    

Remote operating system guess: SunOS 4.1.1 - 4.1.4 (or derivative)
