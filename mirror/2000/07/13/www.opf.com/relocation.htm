        Piper &amp; Flynn ERA understands that relocating can be an unsettling 
        experience for you and your family. With our help your move could be the 
        best trouble free move you have ever made. Through our affiliation with 
        Cendant Mobility Services, the nation&#146;s leading relocation network, 
        our <b>Relocation Department</b> can help you buy, sell or rent a home 
        anywhere in the world. In order to ensure that our customers and clients 
        receive real estate services that exceed their expectations, we select 
        from our best trained, most experienced sales agents to assist you. In 
        fact, they play the role of a counselor to guide you carefully through 
        the total buying and selling process.</font> 
        <p>
     <font face="Arial" size="2">If you are selling your home, 
        a Comparative Market Analysis will suggest to you its market value and 
        a recommended asking price that will sell it at the highest price with 
        the most favorable terms for you. If you are buying a home, a mortgage 
        pre-approval will be performed so that you will know exactly what you 
        can afford, and the assigned sales agent will only show you homes you 
        are able to buy. If you are renting, we will assign an agent to work closely 
        with you to find a suitable home or apartment.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        O'Conor, Piper &amp; Flynn ERA also offers relocation management services 
        directly to corporations.</font></p>
