<center>*sigh* Dear admin, your site's security has been comprised. <br>
why didn't you bother to read about security hazards?<br> or even sign up
to
bugtraq and visit securityfocus and packetstorm regularly.<br>
That way you would have been able to make this site more secure<br>
but you wouldn't have been able to prevent this hack!@~$%<br>
why? you ask, because only one person knows of this vuln<br>
and who is that you ask? he goes by the name of bighawk<br>
<font color="blue"> Nothing has been damaged on your system. We have
patched the hole. All you have to do is mv indexbak.html index.html. Don't
bother saying this hack cost your company or whatever millions or
thousands of ca$h :)</font>

Ok first of all i want to say that TH
suck
ass. You guys use msadc and fp extensions to hack, well it's not 1997
anyone more kids, maybe if it was 1997 it would be ok to hack with those
exploits. Learn how to code AND how to own some *nix sites. All you are is
script kids who use other peoples exloits to look "cool" on attrition..you
are nothing and never will be nothing..speaking of script kids i want to
talk about artech..artech you diss script kids BUT you are one yourself.
you use other peoples exploits that they found to hack sites and then rant
about how "elite" you are. you suck just as much as TH..
