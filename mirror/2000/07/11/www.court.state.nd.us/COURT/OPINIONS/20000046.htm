  <strong>Sandstrom, Justice.</strong>
<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  David F. Mead and Marlene Mead, co-conservators for
Robert D. Mead;
Pauline Mead, also known as Elaine Mead; and Jackie Wolf, trustee for the Jessica
Mead and Justin Mead and Three Affiliated Tribes of Mandan-Hidatsa-Arikara Trust
("the Meads") appeal from a summary judgment of dismissal of the Northwest
Judicial District Court.  We affirm, concluding the issues of whether Robert Mead
was competent and whether he acted intentionally in shooting Keith Braddock are res
judicata, and thus Farmers Union Mutual Insurance Company ("Farmers Union") did
not have a duty to defend or indemnify the Meads in the resulting wrongful death suit.

 

<p align="center">I
<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  On March 20, 1996, Robert Mead shot and killed Officer
Keith Braddock
in Watford City.  Mead was charged with murder, felonious restraint, and terrorizing. 
On April 3, 1996, after Robert Mead's initial appearance, the district court ordered
he be evaluated by a psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  On April 24, 1996, Dr. Dennis Kottke, a psychiatrist at the
North Dakota
State Hospital, submitted his psychiatric evaluation of Robert Mead to the court.  Dr.
Kottke wrote, "It is our impression that the patient is not mentally ill, does not have
a frank mental disorder although he clearly has a lot of paranoid and distrustful
features&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  He is thus felt fit to proceed with the trial."  Robert Mead
did not
contest Dr. Kottke's evaluation.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  Robert Mead acted as his own counsel throughout the
criminal proceedings,
although a court-appointed attorney served as standby counsel.  At trial, Robert Mead
did not deny he shot Keith Braddock, but argued he shot him in self-defense. 
Self-defense was the only defense Robert Mead presented to the jury.  The jury found
him guilty as charged.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  By a complaint dated July 5, 1996, Mary Braddock brought
suit against
Robert Mead for the wrongful death of Keith Braddock, her husband.  On August 13,
1996, Robert Mead created a trust, calling it the Jessica Mead and Justin Mead and
Three Affiliated Tribes of Mandan-Hidatsa-Arikara Trust.  Robert Mead named
Jackie Wolf as trustee.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  On December 26, 1996, the court appointed David F. Mead
and Marlene
Mead as co-conservators for Robert Mead, based on his incarceration at the North
Dakota State Penitentiary.  On April 9, 1997, the district court appointed David F.
Mead and Marlene Mead "as Guardian Ad Litem to represent Robert D. Mead in the
above entitled action while he is confined and detained in the North Dakota State
Penitentiary."
<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  Robert Mead was deposed and stated he intentionally shot
Keith Braddock
in self-defense.  At the time of the shooting, Robert Mead had a farm liability policy
through Farmers Union.  The policy contained an exclusion for intentional acts
committed by the insured.  Farmers Union denied coverage for the Braddock suit.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  David F. Mead and Marlene Mead defended the civil suit and
entered into
a stipulation for judgment under which Robert Mead, "through his family members,"
paid a settlement to the Braddocks.  According to the complaint in the present action,
Pauline Mead provided $60,000 of the settlement money and Jackie Wolf, as trustee
for the Jessica Mead and Justin Mead and Three Affiliated Tribes of Mandan-Hidatsa-Arikara
Trust, provided $40,000 of the settlement funds.  David F. Mead and
Marlene Mead paid the costs of defending the suit.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  The Meads now bring this action against Farmers Union,
seeking
reimbursement for the settlement amounts and attorney's fees.  They allege Robert
Mead is mentally ill and therefore incapable of committing an intentional act.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  On August 30, 1999, Farmers Union moved for summary
judgment.  The
district court granted the motion, and the Meads appealed.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  The Meads' appeal was timely under <a
href="/court/rules/appellat/rule04.htm">N.D.R.App.P. 4(a)</a>.  The district court
had jurisdiction under N.D.C.C. &#167;&nbsp;27-05-06.  This Court has jurisdiction under
N.D. Const. art. VI, &#167;&nbsp;6, and N.D.C.C. &#167;&nbsp;28-27-01.

 

<p align="center">II
<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  Summary judgment is a method for promptly and
expeditiously disposing
of a controversy, without trial, if either party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
law, if no dispute exists as to either the material facts or the inferences to be drawn
from undisputed facts, or if resolving factual issues would not alter the results.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980371.htm">Engel
v. Montana Dakota Utils.</a></u>, 1999 ND 111, <a
href="/court/opinions/980371.htm#P6">&#182;&nbsp;6</a>, 595 N.W.2d 319 (citing <u><a
href="/court/opinions/970218.htm">Perry Ctr.,
Inc. v. Heitkamp</a></u>, 1998 ND 78, <a
href="/court/opinions/970218.htm#P12">&#182;&nbsp;12</a>, 576 N.W.2d 505).
<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  <a href="/court/rules/civil/Rule56.htm">Rule 56(c),
N.D.R.Civ.P.</a>, provides summary judgment should be granted
"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."  "On
appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the
summary judgment motion."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/980371.htm">Engel</a></u>, 1999
ND 111, <a href="/court/opinions/980371.htm#P6">&#182;&nbsp;6</a>, 595 N.W.2d 319
(citing
<u><a href="/court/opinions/970201.htm">Freed v. Unruh</a></u>, 1998 ND 34, <a
href="/court/opinions/970201.htm#P6">&#182;&nbsp;6</a>, 575 N.W.2d 433).

<p align="center">A
<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  In its opinion granting Farmers Union's motion, the district
court held:

  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>[w]hen the jury in <u>State v. Robert Mead</u> returned its
verdict finding Mead guilty of murder, Class AA Felony, it necessarily
determined that he acted with the intent required for the commission of
that offense--that is, that he acted intentionally (or knowingly) when
he fired the shot that killed Keith Braddock.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The district court concluded the criminal judgment "is res judicata as to the issue of
intent and that the Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from re-litigating that issue."
<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  On appeal, the Meads argue their claim against Farmers
Union is not
barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel.  "Res judicata means that a valid, existing
final judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive, with regard to the
issues raised, or those that could have been raised, and determined therein, as to the
parties and their privies in all other actions."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio
Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clark</a></u>, 1998 ND
153, <a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P23">&#182;&nbsp;23</a>, 583 N.W.2d 377
(quoting <u>Peacock v. Sundre Township</u>, 372 N.W.2d
877, 878 (N.D. 1985)).  Collateral estoppel "forecloses the relitigation, in a second
action based on a different claim, of particular issues of either fact or law which were,
or by logical and necessary implication must have been, litigated and determined in
the prior suit."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio Cas. Ins. Co.</a></u>, at <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P23">&#182;&nbsp;23</a> (citation omitted).

<p align="center">1
<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  The Meads claim the district court erred in granting
Farmers Union's
motion for summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact
"regarding the negligence of Keith Braddock vs. the negligence of Robert, and the
state of mind or mental illness of Robert."  They argue that Robert Mead was
incompetent to defend himself at his criminal trial and that a fact question exists as
to whether his waiver of counsel at trial "was knowing and intelligent given his
mental condition."  In addition, the Meads argue there was no evidence presented to
the jury in Robert Mead's criminal case regarding his mental condition or Keith
Braddock's allegedly improper procedures and actions.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  In <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio
Casualty Insurance Co. v. Clark</a></u>, we held there were no genuine
issues of material fact regarding Daniel Clark's intent in shooting George Girodengo
because a jury had previously found the shooting was an intentional act.  1998 ND
153, <a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P12">&#182;&#182;&nbsp;12</a>, <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P28">28</a>, 583 N.W.2d 377.  Following Clark's criminal
trial,
Girodengo's family sued Clark for wrongful death.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Id.</u></a> at <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P2">&#182;&#182;&nbsp;2-3</a>.  Ohio
Casualty Insurance Company, which had issued a homeowner's insurance policy to
Clark, provided him a defense in the civil suit.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Id.</a></u> at <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P4">&#182;&nbsp;4</a>.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, however, brought an
action for a
declaratory judgment, arguing the shooting was excluded from coverage.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio Cas.
Ins. Co.</a></u>, 1998 ND 153, <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P4">&#182;&nbsp;4</a>, 583 N.W.2d 377.  Thus, Ohio
Casualty Insurance
Company claimed it owed no duty to defend or indemnify Clark in the civil suit.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Id.</a></u> 
We held that Clark's killing was an intentional act for which insurance coverage was
excluded, both because there was an intentional act exclusion and for public policy
reasons.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Id.</u></a> at<a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P17"> &#182;&#182;&nbsp;17</a>, <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P28">28</a>, <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P30">30</a>.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  In <u>Poole v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</u>,
which we cited with approval
in <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. v. Clark</a></u>,
William Poole, insured by State Farm Fire
&amp; Casualty Company, was convicted of first-degree murder after a trial in which he
did not specifically assert the insanity defense.  941 F.&nbsp;Supp. 964, 965 (D. Colo.
1996); <u>see</u> 1998 ND 153, <a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P27">&#182;&nbsp;27</a>, 583 N.W.2d 377.  Poole was
then sued for
wrongful death, and a declaratory judgment was sought to determine whether State
Farm was required to defend and indemnify him.  <u>Poole</u>, at 965.  The court in
<u>Poole</u>
held that a finding "beyond a reasonable doubt that one acted with deliberative intent
necessarily negates questions of diminished mental capacity and legal insanity."  <u>Id.</u>
at 968.

<p align="center">2
<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  The facts of the present case are very similar to <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio Casualty Insurance
Co.</a></u> and <u>Poole</u>.  Thus, under <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio
Casualty Insurance Co.</a></u>, we conclude the district 
court correctly determined there were no genuine issues of material fact.  1998 ND
153, 583 N.W.2d 377.  The issues of whether Robert Mead was competent and
whether he acted intentionally in shooting Keith Braddock were raised, litigated, and
determined in Robert Mead's criminal case.  Therefore, the district court did not err
in granting Farmers Union's motion for summary judgment.

<p align="center">B
<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  The Meads further argue Farmers Union breached its duty
of good faith
and fair dealing by failing to defend the Meads in the Braddock suit.  An insurer
generally "has a duty to defend an underlying action against its insured if the
allegations in the complaint give rise to potential liability or a possibility of coverage
under the insurance policy."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm">Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v.
Clark</a></u>, 1998 ND 153, <a href="/court/opinions/980057.htm#P8">&#182;&nbsp;8</a>,
583
N.W.2d 377 (quoting <u><a href="/court/opinions/960187.htm">Nodak Mut. Ins. Co. v.
Heim</a></u>, 1997 ND 36, <a href="/court/opinions/960187.htm#P11">&#182;&nbsp;11</a>,
559
N.W.2d 846).  Section 26.1-32-04, N.D.C.C., provides that "[a]n insurer is not liable
for a loss caused by the willful act of the insured, but the insurer is not exonerated by
the negligence of the insured or of the insured's agents or others."
<p>[&#182;<a name="P22"></a>22]  Because Robert Mead's policy with Farmers Union
contained an exclusion
of liability for intentional acts and because the issue of whether Robert Mead acted
intentionally when he shot and killed Keith Braddock is res judicata, the district court
did not err in ruling Farmers Union had no duty to defend Robert Mead in the
Braddock suit.

 

<p align="center">III<p>[&#182;<a name="P23"></a>23]  The judgment of dismissal of the
district court is affirmed.
