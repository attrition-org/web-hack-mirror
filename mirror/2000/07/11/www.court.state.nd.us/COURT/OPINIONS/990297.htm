  <strong>Maring, Justice.</strong>
<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  Johnson Farms, a general partnership, appealed from a
judgment dismissing
its action against George and Donna McEnroe for specific performance of an oral
agreement for the purchase of real property, but awarding Johnson Farms $91,930 it
overpaid the McEnroes for an adjacent parcel of property Johnson Farms purchased
in January 1994.  The McEnroes cross-appealed from the part of the judgment
awarding Johnson Farms $91,930 plus interest.  We conclude the trial court's pivotal
findings of fact in this case are inconsistent and incapable of reconciliation.  We
reverse and remand for a new trial on all issues.


<p align="center">I
<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  The factual background of this case is detailed in <u><a
href="/court/opinions/970045.htm">Johnson Farms v.
McEnroe</a></u>, 1997 ND 179, 568 N.W.2d 920.  In that case we reversed a summary
judgment in favor of the McEnroes dismissing Johnson Farms' action for specific
performance of an oral agreement to convey 59.17 acres of land adjacent to Grand
Forks because there were genuine issues of material fact to be resolved at trial. 
Johnson Farms claimed it orally agreed in 1993 to purchase 59.17 acres from the
McEnroes for $9,000 per acre, or $532,530.  The parties agreed to structure the
transaction as a "like-kind" property exchange under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 1031 so the
McEnroes could avoid paying capital gains taxes.  According to Johnson Farms, the
initial transaction occurred when it purchased land from Bill and Pamela Rychart for
$373,000 and exchanged it for 30.61 acres of the McEnroes' property in January
1994.  Johnson Farms then owed McEnroe $159,530 for the remaining acreage, and
the parties began to look for additional property to complete the transaction.  In
February 1994, George McEnroe executed an option giving Johnson Farms until April
1, 1995 to either deposit $159,530 in escrow or provide suitable "like-kind" property
to complete the transaction.  Johnson Farms argued even though the option was
invalid, it nevertheless evidenced the overarching oral agreement between the parties. 
Johnson Farms claimed that before suitable property could be found, McEnroe
breached the agreement and refused to complete the balance of the transaction. 
Johnson Farms argued the statute of frauds was no bar to its action against the
McEnroes because it had partially performed the overarching agreement.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  The McEnroes argued no oral agreement existed for the sale
of the entire
59.17 acres of property for $9,000 per acre.  The only agreement between the parties,
according to the McEnroes, was the completed "like-kind" property transaction
involving the 30.61 acres exchanged for the Rychart property.  The McEnroes
admitted George McEnroe granted Johnson Farms a unilateral written option, which
was actually an offer of the right to obtain the second tract of land.  Whether the
option was valid is immaterial, according to the McEnroes, because Johnson Farms
never tendered suitable "like-kind" property to exchange, or deposited $159,530 in
escrow, either within the time limitation contained in the option or afterward.  During
this time period, closure of the Grand Forks Air Force Base was a possibility, and the
McEnroes argued it was only after retention of the base was secured and land
immediately west of the subject property was chosen as the site for the new Aurora
Events Center that Johnson Farms' interest in the remaining tract was kindled.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  Following a bench trial on remand, the trial court ruled
Johnson Farms was
not entitled to specific performance compelling the McEnroes to convey the
remainder of the 59.17 acre tract of land, but also ruled Johnson Farms was entitled
to $91,930 from the McEnroes for "overpayment" of the initial exchange of 30.61
acres in January 1994.

  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he only oral contract that ever existed between
the parties, that is material to this case, is their oral agreement by which
Johnson Farms agreed to exchange the Rychart property it purchased
in November of 1993 for 30.61 acres of property described above.  The
Court further finds that the oral agreement for such exchange included
an agreement of the parties that the property exchanged by the
Defendants had an agreed value of $9,000 per acre, and that the
Plaintiff intended to convey to the Defendants in exchange for
Defendants' property a tract of land having a value corresponding to
the 30.61 acres of the Defendants' land valued at $9,000 per
acre.</BLOCKQUOTE>


  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he tract of land traded by the Defendants to the
Plaintiff pursuant to the oral agreement between the parties was valued
at the agreed price of $9,000 per acre, or a value of $281,070.00.  The
price paid by the Plaintiff for the Rychart property traded to the
Defendant George McEnroe was $373,000.00, $91,930.00 more than
the agreed value of the land traded by Defendants to Plaintiff for said
property.  This constituted an overpayment by the Plaintiff of
$91,930.00.</BLOCKQUOTE>


  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>[E]xcept for the trade of property between the
parties in January of 1994, pursuant to the oral contract as found by the
Court, no other contract for the purchase or sale of land between the
parties, oral or written, was entered into.  The Plaintiff contending for
such an oral contract of purchase and sale of property, has wholly
failed to sustain the burden of proof that such an oral contract ever
existed between the parties with respect to the sale by the Defendant
McEnroes to the Plaintiff Johnson Farms of all or any part of the
property owned by George McEnroe, except the tract that was traded
by the Defendants to the Plaintiff on January 18,
1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  Judgment was entered dismissing Johnson Farms' action for
specific
performance and ordering that McEnroes pay Johnson Farms $91,930, plus interest
from December 14, 1998, which was the date of the final submission of the case to
the court for decision.  Both parties appealed.


<p align="center">II
<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  Johnson Farms argues the trial court erred in finding there
was an agreement
only for the initial exchange of land for the Rychart property in January 1994 because
the evidence establishes this transaction was part of an overarching agreement for the
sale of the entire 59.17 acres, and Johnson Farms partially performed the oral
agreement, taking it out of the statute of frauds.  Johnson Farms also argues the trial
court miscalculated the amount it overpaid the McEnroes for the initial conveyance
of 30.61 acres, and contends it should be awarded interest from January 19, 1994, the
date the parties exchanged deeds.  In their cross-appeal, the McEnroes argue the trial
court erred in finding Johnson Farms overpaid them for the 30.61 acres of land
because there is no evidence the parties agreed to a $9,000 per acre price as part of
the Rychart property exchange.  The McEnroes also argue the trial court erred in
failing to dismiss Donna McEnroe from the action because she did not participate in
any of the discussions between the parties concerning the disputed property.  Both
parties also complain about internal inconsistencies in the trial court's findings of
fact.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  We agree the trial court's findings in this case are not
consistent.  Johnson
Farms' theory throughout these proceedings has been the McEnroes orally agreed in
1993 to sell to Johnson Farms 59.17 acres of land for $9,000 per acre, or for a total
purchase price of $532,530.  Part of the evidence relied on by Johnson Farms to
support its argument an overarching agreement existed is that when the $373,000
Johnson Farms paid for the Rychart property it exchanged for the 30.61 acres of the
McEnroes' property is added to the $159,530 called for by the option for the
remainder of the 59.17 acres, the total sum is $532,530, or $9,000 per acre for the
entire 59.17 acre tract.  The trial court, however, flatly rejected the contention that the
parties reached an oral agreement for the sale of the entire 59.17 acre tract.  The trial
court found that during summer 1993, George McEnroe offered to sell the
approximately 60 acre tract to Johnson Farms for $10,000 per acre, but Johnson
Farms, through a partner, Bert Johnson, would pay only $9,000 per acre.  The trial
court found "the transaction was abandoned" and "the prior negotiations between the
parties with respect to the sale of a 60 acre tract of land by McEnroe" was "nullified."
<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  Instead, the trial court found "the only oral contract that ever
existed
between the parties, that is material to this case, is their oral agreement by which
Johnson Farms agreed to exchange the Rychart property it purchased in November
of 1993 for 30.61 acres of property," and the property exchanged by the McEnroes
"had an agreed value of $9,000 per acre."  The McEnroes argue there is no evidence
the parties negotiated a purchase price of $9,000 per acre for the 30.61 acres
exchanged for the Rychart property, but only negotiated how much land to trade for
the Rychart property.  According to the McEnroes, if the parties had agreed on a
$9,000 per acre price, Johnson Farms would have received 41.44 acres of land for the
Rychart property.  The McEnroes argue this establishes the January 1994 transaction
was simply a "like-kind" property exchange without regard to a per acre price, and
there was no $91,930 overpayment by Johnson Farms for the 30.61 acres.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  Johnson Farms agrees there is no evidence to support a
$9,000 per acre price
for the January 1994 transaction alone, but contends the $9,000 price per acre figure
can only be reached by considering the January 1994 transaction as the first of a two-part
overarching agreement for the purchase of the entire 59.17 acres of property. 
Johnson Farms argues if the January 1994 transaction was a totally separate
transaction, the $373,000 it paid for the Rychart property and exchanged for the
McEnroes 30.61 acres would have resulted in a $12,185.56 per acre purchase price,
when Johnson Farms had offered only $9,000 per acre and McEnroe had asked for
only $10,000 per acre.  Johnson Farms contends the trial court's separate transaction
theory is preposterous because when McEnroe offered to sell the remainder of the
59.17 acres in the February 1994 option for $159,530, it resulted in a $5,585.78 per
acre purchase price only one month after McEnroe sold 30.61 acres for $12,185.56
per acre.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  In its memorandum opinion, the trial court set forth its
reasons for finding
Johnson Farms had overpaid the McEnroes for the 30.61 acres in January 1994:

  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>The Rychart property conveyed to George C.
McEnroe on January 18, 1994 carried a cost to Johnson Farms of
$373,000, or $88,000 more than Bert Johnson's original bid.  That
auction bid was reduced to writing between Bert Johnson and the
Rycharts on November 16, 1993. . . .  Mr. Johnson's $373,000 would
have purchased 41.444+ acres of the McEnroe property, at $9,000.00
an acre.  However, he decided to buy only 31.23 acres.<a name="FN_1_"><a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. . . 
No
mention is made of the differences in the documents of exchange. . . . 
That fact alone has led defendants to contend that the $373,000 should
be considered as the agreed price for the 31.23- acres that they
conveyed to Johnson Farms.  That position appears inconsistent with
the voluntary action of George McEnroe to offer the option terms that
he did.  But for the option, the evidence would support a finding that
the $373,000 was the exchange price for the 31.23 acres actually
purchased by Johnson Farms from George and Donna McEnroe. 
However, the evidence in the case, particularly including the option
offered by George McEnroe on February 19, 1994, shows that the
agreed price for those 31.23 acres was $9,000.00 per
acre.</BLOCKQUOTE>


  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>  $373,000 plus $159,530 equals $532,530, divided
by $9,000 equals 59.17 acres at $9,000 per acre.  59.17 acres less 31.23
purchased equals 27.94 acres remaining unsold.  31.23 acres times
$9,000 per acre equals $281,070 paid and due to McEnroes. $373,000
actually paid by Johnson Farms for Rychart land and exchanged for
31.23 acres. $373,000 less $281,070 equals $91,930.  This amount is
due from McEnroes to Bert Johnson, d/b/a/ Johnson
Farms.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  It is evident the trial court found the parties agreed to a
purchase price of
$9,000 per acre for the January 1994 transaction based solely upon the purchase price
set forth in the option added to the amount paid by Johnson Farms for the Rychart
property, divided by 59.17 acres.  This is tantamount to a finding that the Rychart
property exchange was only the first part of an overarching agreement for the
purchase of the entire 59.17 acres.  The trial court's use of this method to calculate
the overpayment is internally inconsistent with its finding that the only agreement
between the parties was for the purchase of the 30.61 acres of land in January 1994.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  We favor permitting a trial court, upon motion of a party,
to
clarify obvious
inconsistencies and ambiguities in its judgments.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980190.htm">Woodworth v. Chillemi</a></u>, 1999 ND
43, <a href="/court/opinions/980190.htm#P14">&#182; 14</a>, 590 N.W.2d 446.  However,
where the inconsistencies and ambiguities
in the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are incapable of
reconciliation to support a judgment, reversal and remand for a new trial is required. 
<u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>United States v. Jefferson Electric Mfg. Co.</u>, 291 U.S. 386, 405-06
(1934);
<u>Renfer v. Skaggs</u>, 215 P.2d 487, 489 (Cal. App. 1950); <u>Wickham v. Famco Services,
Inc.</u>, 350 So.2d 1159, 1161 (Fla. App. 1977); <u>Bob Anderson Pontiac, Inc. v.
Davidson</u>, 293 N.E.2d 232, 237 (Ind. App. 1973); <u>Hawkins v. Teeples and Thatcher,
Inc.</u>, 515 P.2d 927, 931-32 (Or. 1973); 75B Am.Jur. <u>Trial</u> &#167; 1982 (1992); 89
C.J.S. <u>Trial</u> &#167; 636 (1955).  The test is similar to the one applied to a jury's special
verdict, where we will reverse and remand for a new trial if no reconciliation of the
jury's answers is possible and the inconsistency is such that the special verdict will
not support the judgment entered below or any other judgment.  <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u><a
href="/court/opinions/970133.htm">Barta v.
Hinds</a></u>, 1998 ND 104, <a href="/court/opinions/970133.htm#P6">&#182; 6</a>, 578
N.W.2d 553; <u><a href="/court/opinions/950272.htm">Fontes v. Dixon</a></u>, 544 N.W.2d
869,
871 (N.D. 1996); <u>Binstock v. Fort Yates Public School District</u>, 463 N.W.2d 837,
839-40 (N.D. 1990); <u>Massey-Ferguson Credit Corp. v. Orr</u>, 420 N.W.2d 1, 3 (N.D.
1988).
<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  The pivotal issue in this case is whether there was an oral
agreement for
the purchase of the entire 59.17 acres of the McEnroe property.  The trial court's
express finding and its method of determining Johnson Farms' overpayment for the
initial 30.61 acre exchange provide opposite answers to this question.  The parties
have not suggested how this inconsistency can be reconciled, and we, too, are unable
to resolve the conflict.  We conclude the trial court's inconsistent findings do not
support the judgment, and we reverse and remand for a new trial on all issues.


<p align="center">III
<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  The McEnroes argue the trial court erred in failing to
dismiss Donna
McEnroe as a party to this action because there is no evidence she participated in any
of the discussions or negotiations concerning the property Johnson Farms seeks to
recover through specific performance.  The McEnroes moved to dismiss Donna
McEnroe from the action, but the trial court failed to specifically rule on the motion.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  Title to all of the 59.17 acres involved in this case is in the
name of George
McEnroe alone.  Donna McEnroe signed the initial deed conveying the 30.61 acres
to Johnson Farms in January 1994 and the later deed conveying the additional .62
acres to Johnson Farms in July 1994.  During trial, she claimed a homestead interest
in the remainder of the 59.17 acres.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  In <u>Sexton v. Sutherland</u>, 37 N.D. 500, 164 N.W.
278 (1917), Patrick
Sexton and Margaret Sexton, husband and wife, sued the defendants to quiet title to
real property claimed as their homestead.  Title to the property was in the name of
Patrick Sexton alone.  The defendants argued, because legal title to the homestead
was in the name of the husband, the wife did not have a sufficient interest to maintain
an action to determine adverse claims.  This Court said:

  <p><BLOCKQUOTE>The question here presented is whether [Margaret
Sexton] is a proper party plaintiff in an action instituted by her husband
to determine adverse claims to such homestead.  We are agreed that,
while a wife is not an indispensable party to such action she is
nevertheless a proper party.  She is clearly interested in the object of,
and the relief sought in, the action.  She has an interest in the subject-matter of the litigation,
which cannot be concluded by decree unless
she is made a party to the proceeding.  If the defendants had desired to
enforce their claims against the premises either by action to determine
adverse claims or otherwise, it would have been manifestly proper for
them to join both Patrick Sexton and Margaret Sexton as parties
defendant.  In fact, this would have been absolutely necessary in order
to obtain a judgment concluding the homestead rights, if any, of
Margaret Sexton in the premises.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<u>Sexton</u>, 37 N.D. at 511, 164 N.W. at 282.  <u>Sexton</u> comports with the
generally
recognized rule that one spouse cannot be divested of homestead rights by judicial
proceedings in which only the other spouse is a party, even if title to the homestead
property is in the name of the other spouse alone.  <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>Francksen v.
Miller</u>, 297
N.W.2d 375, 377-78 (Iowa 1980); <u>Priddy v. Massey</u>, 256 P.2d 425, 426-27 (Okla.
1953); Annot., <u>Judgment involving real property against one spouse as binding
against other spouse not a party to the proceeding</u>, 58 A.L.R.2d 701, &#167; 18 (1958).
<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  Donna McEnroe is a proper party in this action for specific
performance
of an oral agreement for the purchase of property in which she claims a homestead
interest.  If specific performance is granted, Donna McEnroe's homestead rights, if
any, under N.D.C.C. ch. 47-18, will need to be addressed.  Because we reverse and
remand for a new trial, thus placing this case in its original posture, it is unnecessary
to decide whether the trial court erred in failing to dismiss Donna McEnroe from the
action after dismissing Johnson Farms' claim for specific performance.
