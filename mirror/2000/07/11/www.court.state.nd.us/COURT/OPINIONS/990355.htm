<p align="center"><strong>N.D. Securities Commissioner v. Juran and Moody,
Inc.</a></strong>

<h5 align="center">No. <a name="6">990355</a></h5>


  <strong>Kapsner, Justice.</strong>
<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  The North Dakota Securities Commissioner
("Commissioner") appeals from
the district court's dismissal of his <p>Appeal from the final decision of the administrative
law judge ("ALJ") which dismissed the Commissioner's order against Juran and
Moody, Inc., et al. ("Juran and Moody").  We hold the Commissioner is allowed to
appeal under N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15 and has standing to appeal.  We therefore
reverse and remand to the district court.

<p align="center">I
<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  On July 24, 1997, the Commissioner issued an order against
Juran and
Moody.  The Commissioner ordered Juran and Moody to stop offering unregistered,
nonexempt securities and to pay $175,000 for violations of securities laws.  Juran and
Moody timely requested a hearing.   Juran and Moody filed objections to the
Commissioner's order, asserting, in part, the Commissioner had improperly destroyed
documents regarding the treatment of securities transactions of other companies<a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  and
Juran and Moody had relied on those documents in its own securities transactions. 
The Commissioner submitted a request for an ALJ to the Office of Administrative
Hearings ("OAH").  The request listed the Commissioner and Juran and Moody as the
parties, described the matter as an "[a]ppeal of Commissioner's order based on
unregistered securities offerings, misrepresentation and failure to provide information
to the Commissioner," and indicated the Commissioner sought an ALJ "[t]o conduct
the hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a <u>final</u> order." (emphasis
in original).  Explaining his decision to request a final order, the Commissioner
indicated he "felt that it was very important to allow the hearing officer to make the
final decision since Juran &amp; Moody were already accusing the Commissioner of being
biased."      
<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  The OAH designated an ALJ to hear the matter.  Prior to a
hearing, several
motions were made.  Juran and Moody moved the ALJ for permission to serve
interrogatories upon the Commissioner.  The Commissioner initially contested the
motion but later provided Juran and Moody with the requested information.  Juran
and Moody successfully moved the ALJ to exclude an affidavit submitted by the
Commissioner.  Both Juran and Moody and the Commissioner moved the ALJ for
summary judgment. 
<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  A hearing was held before the ALJ in November 1998.  Juran
and Moody
and the Commissioner attended and presented  arguments to the ALJ.  On January 22,
1999, the ALJ issued "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on Cross-Motions for
Summary Judgment."  The ALJ found Juran and Moody did not violate
securities registration laws and dismissed the Commissioner's imposition of civil
penalties.  The ALJ, however, did not resolve all the issues.  The Commissioner
withdrew the  allegations regarding the remaining issues.  The ALJ issued a final
order of dismissal on April 20, 1999.  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  The Commissioner appealed to district court.  Asserting the
Commissioner
lacked standing to appeal, Juran and Moody filed a motion to dismiss.  The court
concluded "the agency has not established that it has 'standing' for purposes of
appealing its own final order" and granted Juran and Moody's motion to dismiss.  The
Commissioner appealed.  

<p align="center">II 
<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  The Commissioner argues N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15
should be interpreted
to allow his <p>Appeal from the ALJ's decision.  The interpretation of  a statute is a
question of law fully reviewable by this Court.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/960299.htm">Medcenter One, Inc. v. North Dakota
State Bd. of Pharmacy</a></u>, 1997 ND 54, <a
href="/court/opinions/960299.htm#P13">&#182; 13</a>, 561 N.W.2d 634.  Our primary goal
is to ascertain legislative intent.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/960299.htm">Id</a>.</u>  We
look first to the language of the statute.   <u><a href="/court/opinions/960299.htm">Id</a>.</u> 
We read statutes as a whole to give meaning to each word and phrase, whenever fairly
possible.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/960299.htm">Id</a>.</u>  If the language is clear and
unambiguous, the legislative intent is
presumed clear from the face of the statute.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/960299.htm">Id</a>.</u>  "If the language of a statute is
ambiguous, the court may resort to extrinsic aids to interpret the statute."  <u>Blackburn,
Nickels &amp; Smith, Inc. v. National Farmers Union Property &amp; Cas. Co.</u>, 452
N.W.2d
319, 322 (N.D. 1990).  A statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible to differing rational
meanings.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/950256.htm">Northern X-Ray Co., Inc. v. State ex rel.
Hanson</a></u>, 542 N.W.2d 733, 735
(N.D. 1996).  Ambiguity may result where the Legislature has amended portions of
a statute.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/910328.htm">Roggenbuck v. North Dakota Workers
Comp. Bur.</a></u>, 481 N.W.2d 599, 602
(N.D. 1992) (noting "the ambiguity resulting from the amendments to section
65-05-15, N.D.C.C.").
<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]   Section 28-32-15, N.D.C.C., is susceptible to differing
rational meanings
and is thus ambiguous.   On several occasions, the Legislature has amended different
portions of the statute.  Subsection one suggests the Commissioner, as a party to the
administrative proceedings, may <p>Appeal from the ALJ's decision.  N.D.C.C. &#167;
28-32-15(1). 
It indicates "[a]ny party to any proceeding heard by an administrative
agency, except in cases where the order of the administrative agency is declared final
by any other statute, may <p>Appeal from the order."   <u>Id.</u>    "'Party' means each person
named or admitted as a party or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be
admitted as a party.  An administrative agency may be a party."  N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-01(8). 
Other subsections, however, suggest the Commissioner, as the agency, may
not appeal.   Subsection four provides "[a]n appeal shall be taken by serving a notice
of appeal . . . upon the administrative agency concerned."  N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15(4). 
Subsection five provides "[t]he agency and all other parties of record who are
not designated as appellants must be named as appellees."  N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15(5). 
Subsection six provides "[t]he bond or other undertaking [filed by the
appellant] . . . may be enforced by the agency concerned."  N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15(6).
<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  Because the statute is ambiguous, we may consider extrinsic
evidence to
interpret it.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/960331.htm">State v. Brossart</a></u>, 1997 ND
119, <a href="/court/opinions/960331.htm#P14">&#182; 14</a>, 565 N.W.2d 752.  Under

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]   Interpreting N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15 to preclude the
Commissioner from
appealing from the ALJ's final decision would frustrate the apparent, although not 
explicit, legislative intent.  "[O]ur interpretation must be consistent with legislative
intent and done in a manner which will accomplish the policy goals and objectives of
the statutes."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/950428.htm">In the Interest of K.G.</a></u>, 551
N.W.2d 554, 556-57 (N.D. 1996) (citations
omitted).  The consequences of construing N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15 to preclude the
Commissioner's appeal, a proper consideration under N.D.C.C. &#167; 1-02-39(5),
compel us to hold that in the limited context where an agency requests the OAH
designate an ALJ to issue a final decision and appeal is not expressly prohibited,<a
href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the
requesting agency is allowed to appeal under N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15. 
<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  Finality is a concept central to the administrative process
as it establishes
the time to petition for reconsideration under N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-14, the
effectiveness of the order under N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-14.1, and the time for appeal
under N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15.  Understood within the statutory construct of
administrative agency actions, the finality of an order is a precondition to taking
further action, not a prohibition against further appeal.  <u>See</u> II Kenneth Culp Davis
&amp;
Richard J. Pierce, Jr., <u>Administrative Law Treatise</u> &#167; 15.11, at 355 (3d ed. 1994)
(emphasizing "[c]ourts have long held that only 'final agency action' is reviewable"
and noting final actions are "immediately reviewable" under section 704 of the
Administrative Procedure Act).   We believe the district court misinterpreted the word
"final" in the Commissioner's request to the OAH as precluding appeal by the
Commissioner from the ALJ's decision.
<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  The Legislature has developed a scheme allowing an
agency the option to
request the OAH designate an ALJ to issue a final decision rather than a
recommendation.  <u>See</u> <u><a href="/court/opinions/970013.htm">Blanchard v. North
Dakota Workers Comp. Bur.</a></u>, 1997 ND
118, <a href="/court/opinions/970013.htm#P14">&#182; 14</a>, 565 N.W.2d 485 (providing
"[w]hen read as a whole, the statutory
scheme for decisions by an ALJ manifests a legislative intent that an ALJ's decision
is a final order when the Legislature has authorized the ALJ to issue a final order, or
when the requesting agency has authorized the ALJ to issue a final order").  Section
28-32-13(2), N.D.C.C., indicates if a "person authorized by the agency head or by
law to issue a final order, is presiding, the order issued is the final order."  Under
N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-08.5(6), a hearing officer has a duty to "[m]ake findings of fact
and conclusions of law and issue a final order, if required by statute or requested by
an agency."  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  In enacting N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-08.5(6) and related
statutes, the
Legislature was concerned with "accurately reflect[ing] the independent nature of
OAH hearing officers."   <u>Hearing on H.B. 1089 Before the House Judiciary Comm.</u>,
54th N.D. Legis. Sess. (March 30, 1995) (memorandum from OAH Director Allen C.
Hoberg to the Legislature).
<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  Likewise, in creating the OAH, the Legislature emphasized
the value of
independence and impartiality in administrative proceedings.  "A central
administrative tribunal is inherently separate from and therefore independent of the
agency pursuing the issue under adjudication.  This simple, yet fundamental feature
dramatically enhances . . . fairness."  <u>Hearing on S.B. 2234 Before the House
Judiciary Comm.</u>, 52nd N.D. Legis Sess. (March 6, 1991) (letter from Charles D.
McFaul, Chief Administrative Law Judge for the City of New York, to North Dakota
Attorney General Nicholas J. Spaeth) ["<u>Hearing on S.B. 2234</u>"].  An independent
hearing body also "would remove the appearance of impropriety" that may exist
where an agency uses it own employees as hearing officers.  <u>Hearing on S.B. 2234</u>,
<u>supra</u> (remarks of North Dakota Senator Jim Maxson).  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  An agency's option to request designation of an ALJ to
issue a final
decision is important where, as here, the party opposing the agency alleges the agency
is prejudiced against the party.   Juran and Moody alleged the Commissioner had
improperly destroyed documents which Juran and Moody had relied upon in issuing
its securities.  Acknowledging the allegation, the Commissioner requested the OAH
designate an ALJ to issue a final decision.   In such circumstances, exercise of the
agency's option to request a final ALJ decision completely separates the agency from
the decisionmaker, thus "remov[ing] [any] appearance of impropriety" and ensuring
the actual independence and impartiality of the decisionmaker.  <u>See</u> <u>Hearing on S.B.
2234</u>, <u>supra</u> (remarks of North Dakota Senator Jim Maxson).  If we held an agency
that exercised its option to request a final ALJ decision was precluded from
appealing, we would deter agencies from using the option in circumstances such as
this where the agency itself believes there is a benefit, because of the issues raised,
to use an independent final decisionmaker.    

    [&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  Because construing N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15 to
preclude the Commissioner from
appealing would frustrate the Legislature's apparent intent, we conclude where an
agency requests the OAH designate an ALJ to issue a final decision, N.D.C.C. &#167;
28-32-15 allows the requesting agency to appeal from that final decision unless such
appeal is otherwise precluded.  <u>See</u> N.D.C.C. &#167; 54-44.3-12.2 (requiring the
Central Personnel Division to request the OAH designate an ALJ to issue a final
decision and precluding the Central Personnel Division from appealing from the
ALJ's decision). 

<p align="center">III
<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  In addition to being allowed to appeal under N.D.C.C.
&#167; 28-32-15, the
Commissioner must have standing to <p>Appeal from the ALJ decision.  <u>See</u> <u><a
href="/court/opinions/950407.htm">Shark v.
U.S. West Communications, Inc.</a></u>, 545 N.W.2d 194, 197 (N.D. 1996) (indicating
"[w]hile this definition [of party in N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-01(8)] helped identify a
party for purposes of the agency proceeding, it added nothing to the distinct concept
of standing for judicial review of an agency decision").  The Commissioner argues
he satisfies our test for standing to appeal from an agency decision.  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  In <u>Application of Bank of Rhame</u>, 231 N.W.2d
801, 808 (N.D. 1975), we
established the requirements for standing to appeal from an agency decision.  A
person has standing if the person:  (1) participates in the proceedings before an
administrative agency, (2) is directly interested in the proceedings, and (3) is factually
aggrieved by the agency's decision.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/950407.htm">Shark</a></u>,
at 198 (explaining <u>Application of Bank
of Rhame</u>).
<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  Here, the  Commissioner participated in the proceedings
before the ALJ
and thus satisfies the first requirement for standing.  Juran and Moody, the
Commissioner himself, and the ALJ treated the Commissioner as a party to the
proceedings before the ALJ.  Juran and Moody moved to serve interrogatories upon
the Commissioner, to exclude an affidavit submitted by the Commissioner, and for
summary judgment.  The Commissioner moved the ALJ to issue summary judgment. 
Both Juran and Moody and the Commissioner participated in oral argument before
the ALJ.  The ALJ accepted motions and briefs and heard arguments from both Juran
and Moody and the Commissioner.  The ALJ indicated his prehearing scheduling
order was "based on the agreement of the parties."  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  The Commissioner  was directly interested in the
proceedings and therefore
meets the second requirement for standing.   When administrative agencies  "engage[]
in a policy-making function, represent the public interest in the proper enforcement
of the law being administered, and where the public as well as private parties have an
interest in upholding the order of the agency, the agency itself is the proper party to
represent this public interest."  2 Am. Jur. 2d <u>Administrative Law</u> &#167; 642 (1994
&amp;
Supp. 1999) (discussing an agency's <p>Appeal from the final judgment of a court
reviewing the agency's determination); <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>State v. Chicago &amp;
N.W. Ry. Co.</u>,
179 N.W. 378, 383 (N.D. 1920) (noting "it is readily to be inferred that the board [of
Railroad Commissioners] itself as a public agency is charged primarily with
protecting the interests of the public"); <u>Board of Adjustment of City of Fort Worth
v. Stovall</u>, 216 S.W.2d 171, 173-74 (Tex. 1949) (reasoning the zoning board
"represents the public interest in the proper enforcement of the particular law or
regulation involved" and "there is a definite public interest to be protected" and thus
reversing the lower appellate court's dismissal of the zoning board's <p>Appeal from the
district court's decision).  The Commissioner has a strong interest in and
responsibility for the proper and uniform application of securities laws.  Under
N.D.C.C. &#167; 10-04-16(1), the Commissioner may issue a cease and desist order or
a suspension order for a violation of chapter 10-04 if "the commissioner deems [it]
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors."  The
statute also authorizes the Commissioner to impose fines for violations of the chapter. 
N.D.C.C. &#167; 10-04-16(1).    
<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  Finally, the Commissioner was factually aggrieved by the
ALJ's decision
and thus satisfies the third requirement for standing. The ALJ reversed the
Commissioner's findings of securities laws violations and the Commissioner's
imposition of civil penalties for the violations.  The Commissioner's interest in
ensuring proper and uniform application of securities laws for "the public interest"
and "the protection of investors," <u>see</u> N.D.C.C. &#167; 10-04-16(1), may be impeded
by a decision adverse to the Commissioner's prior exercise of authority.  That interest
is protected by permitting judicial review of such decisions.  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  We conclude the Commissioner satisfies the test
established in <u>Application
of Bank of Rhame</u> and thus does have standing to appeal from the ALJ's decision.


<p align="center">IV
<p>[&#182;<a name="P22"></a>22]  Because the ALJ is an employee of the OAH,<a
href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> an independent and
nonspecialized agency, the appropriate standard of review of a final decision made
by an ALJ must be analyzed.  When reviewing an agency decision, generally, a
deferential standard applies. 
<p>[&#182;<a name="P23"></a>23]  Regarding review of an agency's factual findings, we have
explained we
do not make independent findings or substitute our judgment for that of the agency,
but determine only whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined the
findings were proven by the weight of the evidence in the record.  <u><a

Dakota Workers Comp. Bur.</a></u>, 1999 ND 174, <a
href="/court/opinions/990057.htm#P7">&#182; 7</a>, 599 N.W.2d 280.  "It is the
agency's responsibility to assess the credibility of witnesses and resolve conflicts in
the evidence."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/990057.htm">Id</a>.</u>  An agency is required to
adequately explain its rationale if it
rejects the recommendations of an ALJ.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/970013.htm">Blanchard v.
North Dakota Workers Comp.
Bur.</a></u>, 1997 ND 118, <a href="/court/opinions/970013.htm#P21">&#182; 21</a>, 565
N.W.2d 485.  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P24"></a>24]  Here, deference to the ALJ's factual findings is warranted. 
The ALJ had
the opportunity to observe the witnesses and the "responsibility to assess the
credibility of witnesses and resolve conflicts in the evidence."  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/990057.htm">Stewart</a></u>, at <a
href="/court/opinions/990057.htm#P7">&#182; 7</a>. 
Moreover, even where an ALJ issues a mere recommendation, the ALJ is afforded
some deference since the agency must sufficiently explain its rationale if it rejects the
ALJ's recommendation.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/970013.htm">Blanchard</a></u>, at <a
href="/court/opinions/970013.htm#P21">&#182; 21.</a>
<p>[&#182;<a name="P25"></a>25]  Regarding review of an agency's legal conclusions, we
have indicated an
agency "has a reasonable range of informed discretion in the interpretation and
application of its own rules."  <u>In the Matter of Permits to Drain Related to Stone
Creek Channel Improvements and White Spur Drain</u>, 424 N.W.2d 894, 900 (N.D.
1988).   "[C]ourts generally defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation when the
language is so technical that only a specialized agency has the experience and
expertise to understand it or when the language is ambiguous."   <u>Id.</u> 
<p>[&#182;<a name="P26"></a>26]  Similar deference to the ALJ's legal conclusions is not
justified.  Unlike
an agency, an ALJ does not necessarily have specialized knowledge or expertise. 
Section 54-57-03(1), N.D.C.C., indicates the OAH must conduct "all hearings of
administrative agencies under chapter 28-32" except those expressly excluded. 
Although N.D.C.C. &#167; 54-57-03(4) indicates "the director [of the OAH] shall
attempt to assign an administrative law judge having expertise in the subject matter
to be dealt with," the OAH is not a specialized agency and the ALJ is not interpreting
the OAH's own rules. The ALJ here was interpreting and applying the rules of the
Securities Commission, an agency independent from the OAH.  
<p>[&#182;<a name="P27"></a>27]  We accordingly hold where an agency requests the OAH
designate an ALJ
to issue a final decision, judicial review of the ALJ's factual findings should involve
the same standard of review used for agency decisions, but the ALJ's legal
conclusions must be reviewed in the same manner as legal conclusions generally,
without special deference to the ALJ. 

<p align="center">V
<p>[&#182;<a name="P28"></a>28]  Because the Commissioner may appeal from the ALJ's
final decision under
N.D.C.C. &#167; 28-32-15 and has standing to appeal, we reverse the dismissal of his
appeal and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
