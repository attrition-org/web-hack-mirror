<p align="center"><strong>Disciplinary Board v. McDonald</a></strong> 

<p align="center"><strong>Nos. <a name="6">990359-361</a></strong> 

<p><strong>Per Curiam.</strong> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  The Disciplinary Board petitions for disciplinary action
against Scott J. McDonald for
making a statement of fact and offering evidence to a court which he knew was false.  We
conclude there is clear and convincing evidence McDonald violated <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 3.3(a)</a>,
and we order McDonald be suspended from the practice of law for six months and one day,
successfully complete the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination, and pay the full
costs of the disciplinary proceedings.

<p align="center">I

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  McDonald was admitted to practice law in North Dakota on
May 29, 1987.  During the
period relevant to this case, McDonald was a sole practitioner in Bowman.  In June 1993,
McDonald represented Howard Brooks in making a claim for abandoned mineral interests in
Slope County.  At the time, McDonald had one full-time secretary, Becky Hodell, on his staff.  A
part-time secretary, Carolyn Russell, worked occasionally when additional assistance was needed. 
With Russell's help, McDonald prepared a notice of lapse of mineral interest under N.D.C.C. ch.
38-18.1.  He directed Russell to have the notice published in the official county newspaper; mail
the notice to Mabel E. and J. L. Albright, the owners of the mineral interests, at their last known
post office address within 10 days of the final publication; and file the notice and an affidavit of
service with the Slope County Register of Deeds.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  In July 1993, the notice was published in the Slope County
Messenger.  In August or
September 1993, Russell told McDonald everything had been completed for the termination of the
mineral interests, and McDonald had the Brooks file placed with his inactive files.  Russell no
longer worked for McDonald after June 1995.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  In April 1996, client Brooks asked McDonald whether the
Albrights' mineral interests
were terminated, because Brooks had discovered the notice had not been filed with the Slope
County Register of Deeds.  McDonald reviewed the file and found the notice and an affidavit of
service had not been recorded with the Register of Deeds, and no affidavit of service of the notice
had been prepared.  According to McDonald, there was an envelope in the file which appeared to
have the notice addressed to the Albrights and which had been returned by the United States
Postal Service as being undeliverable.  In May 1996, McDonald recorded the notice of lapse of
mineral interest and an affidavit of publication with the Slope County Register of Deeds, but did
not record an affidavit of service of the notice.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  In November 1996, the Albright heirs brought a quiet title
action against members of the
Brooks family, seeking to eliminate the notice of lapse of mineral interest from the title of the
property and to have the Brookses declared as having no interest in the mineral acres.  In
December 1996, McDonald answered the quiet title action on behalf of the Brookses.  In January
1997, the Albright heirs moved for summary judgment.  McDonald opposed the summary
judgment motion and made a counter-motion for summary judgment, arguing the mineral interests
of the Albright heirs had terminated under the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 38-18.1.  With his
response, McDonald filed an affidavit in which he claimed:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>3. That on the 20th day of July, 1993, my office did cause to be
placed in the
United States Mails, a photocopy of Brooks' Notice of Lapse of Mineral Interest, addressed to
J.L. Albright and Mabel Albright at 6922 South Halstead Street, Chicago, Illinois; and

<p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>4. That on August 3, 1993, the United States Post Office returned
the said
envelope containing Brooks' Notice of Lapse of Mineral Interest addressed to J.L. Albright and
Mabel Albright, to my law office, and that the envelope was marked by the United States Post
Office as being "Undeliverable", at which time the said envelope was placed into my file.

<p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  McDonald argued in his brief to the trial court that title
vested in the surface owner,
Brooks, because the procedural requirements under N.D.C.C. ch. 38-18.1 were satisfied:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  In this action, there is no question that publication was made once
each week
in the official county newspaper in the county in which these minerals are located.  Additionally,
as the attached Affidavits and copies of the return delivery of the certified mailings show, the
Notice was not only properly published, but was also sent to the last known mailing address of the
alleged mineral interest owners, J.L. Albright and Mabel Albright.  This Notice was mailed within
10 days of the date after the last publication date of the Notice of Lapse of Mineral Interest on
July 15, 1993.  See Exhibit "3".  It is also clear that a copy of the Notice and the Affidavit of the
Service of the Notice by publication was recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds in the
County in which the mineral interests are located.  Pursuant to North Dakota Century Code
&#167;
38-18.1-06, this is prima facie evidence in these legal proceedings that such notice has been
given.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  Along with these materials, McDonald also filed a photocopy
of the envelope which was
purportedly mailed to the Albrights on July 20, 1993, and a photocopy of the Postal Service's
"Domestic Return Receipt," "PS Form 3811."  The attorney for the Albright heirs noticed
discrepancies on the envelope and the Form 3811.  The postmark date on the envelope was "JUL
20," but no year was indicated.  The Form 3811 had a publication date of "December 1994."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  The attorney for the Albright heirs filed an affidavit from the
Dickinson Postmaster, who
said the "Form 3811 was not available for use by the United States Post Office or its patrons until
sometime late in 1994, or perhaps even early 1995."  The Albrights' attorney also served a
subpoena duces tecum on McDonald requiring him to bring the envelope and the mailing receipts
to the summary judgment hearing.  McDonald withdrew his reliance on the alleged July 20, 1993
mailing, and turned to an older notice of abandonment of mineral interests which had been
recorded in 1988 to support Brooks' legal position.  The trial court ruled in favor of the Albright
heirs, and McDonald personally paid the costs of judgment.  These disciplinary proceedings were
instituted.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  When the envelope, which was purportedly mailed on July
20, 1993 to the Albrights,
was opened at the disciplinary hearing for the first time since it was filed in the quiet title action, it
contained a copy of the notice of lapse of mineral interest dated June 21, 1993, and a copy of the
affidavit of publication.  The affidavit of publication was sworn and subscribed to on August 6,
1993, 17 days after McDonald said the envelope was mailed.  McDonald claimed Russell mailed
the envelope.  Russell did not testify at the hearing and her whereabouts are unknown.<a
name="FN_1_"><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  The hearing body found the envelope was not mailed on
July 20, 1993, "but the
circumstances make it clear the envelope was placed in the mail after [McDonald] reviewed his
file in April, 1996 on or about July 20, 1996."  The hearing body also found not all of the
markings on the envelope were made by Postal Service personnel:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  McDonald testified Russell told him in August or September, 1993
that she
had completed everything which needed to be done to terminate the mineral interests for Brooks. 
She was not employed by McDonald after June 2, 1995.  The envelope placed in the mail to
Mabel E. Albright and J. L. Albright on or about July 20, 1996 and which was found
undeliverable by the Postal Service and placed in McDonald's file, was not placed there by
Carolyn Russell.  Someone in McDonald's office created a forgery of an envelope to evidence
mailing of a Notice of Lapse of Mineral Interest to Mabel E. Albright and J. L. Albright, M.D. 
Only Russell and McDonald had motive to do so, and only McDonald had the opportunity to do
so.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  Reasonable inferences drawn from the circumstantial evidence and
other
evidence provide testimony of clear and convincing proof that when McDonald discovered the
statutory requirements had not been met for the termination of a mineral interest during his review
of the file for Brooks in April, 1996, that he acted on or about July 20, 1996 to create a forgery of
an envelope to falsely suggest mailing of a Notice of Lapse of Mineral Interest to Mabel E.
Albright and J. L. Albright, M.D. on July 20, 1993.  The forgery was prepared in order to give the
appearance of compliance with statutory requirements for the termination of the Albright mineral
interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  The hearing body concluded that when McDonald filed his
affidavit in the quiet title
action, the forged envelope he created evidenced a mailing of the notice in compliance with the
statutory requirements for terminating mineral interests, and in the affidavit McDonald "made a
statement of fact to the Court and offered evidence to the Court which he knew to be false in
violation of <a href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 3.3(a)</a>." 
As a sanction, the hearing body recommended
McDonald's license to practice law be suspended for 60 days and he be ordered to pay the costs
of the disciplinary proceeding.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  The Disciplinary Board adopted the report of the hearing
body, but recommended
McDonald pay one-half of the costs of the proceedings and submitted  its report to this Court. 
McDonald timely filed objections to the report and both parties presented briefs and oral
argument.  We consider the Board's report under <a
href="/Court/Rules/Discipline/Rule3.1.htm">N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl. 3.1(F)</a>.

<p align="center">A

<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  The Board found McDonald violated <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof.
Conduct 3.3(a)</a>, which provides, "A
lawyer shall not: (1) Make a statement to a tribunal of fact or law that the lawyer knows to be
false; or (2) Offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false."  <u>See also</u> N.D.C.C.
&#167;
27-13-01(6) (requiring attorneys shall "never seek to mislead the judge or jury by any artifice or
false statement of fact or law").  The high duty of candor placed upon attorneys is summarized in
<u><a href="/court/opinions/900393.htm">Disciplinary Board v. Kaiser</a></u>, 484 N.W.2d
102, 108 (N.D. 1992) (citations omitted):

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  "'Truth and candor are synonymous with justice, and honesty is an
implicit
characteristic of the legal profession.'  ABA, <u>The Judicial Response to Lawyer
Misconduct</u>, III.1,
III.3 (1984).  The primary function of our judicial system is to find the truth to reach a just
conclusion. . . .  Our courts are almost 'wholly dependent on members of the bar to marshal and
present the true facts. . . .'" </BLOCKQUOTE>

<p align="center">1

<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  McDonald argues all exhibits relied upon by the Board
were introduced by McDonald
and not by disciplinary counsel during his case-in-chief, and because McDonald moved for a
"directed verdict" at the close of disciplinary counsel's case-in-chief, we cannot rely on this
material in determining whether there is clear and convincing evidence he violated <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof.
Conduct 3.3(a)</a>.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  Although disciplinary proceedings are neither civil nor
criminal, but quasi-judicial in
nature, the Rules of Evidence and Civil Procedure apply "insofar as appropriate . . . ."  <a
href="/Court/Rules/Discipline/Rule3.5.htm">N.D.R.
Lawyer Discipl. 3.5(B)</a>.  In a criminal context, a defendant permits this Court to review the
entire
record to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to sustain the verdict if the defendant
presents evidence after a <a href="/Court/Rules/Criminal/Rule29.htm">N.D.R.Crim.P. 29(a)</a>
motion for judgment of acquittal is denied.  <u>See</u>
<u><a href="/court/opinions/960092.htm">State v. Jones</a></u>, 557 N.W.2d 375, 377 (N.D.
1996).  A similar result ensues in a civil
context when
a defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law under <a
href="/court/rules/civil/Rule50.htm">N.D.R.Civ.P. 50(a)</a>.  "Technically a
party waives the right to a judgment as a matter of law if the motion is made at the close of the
opponent's case, and thereafter the moving party introduces evidence in its own behalf."  9A
Wright &amp; Miller, <u>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</u> &#167; 2534, at p. 322
(1995) (footnote
omitted) (discussing the federal counterpart to <a
href="/Court/rules/civil/Rule50.htm">N.D.R.Civ.P. 50(a)</a>).  <u>See also</u> <u>Pease v.
Magill</u>, 17
N.D. 166, 169, 115 N.W. 260, 261 (1908).  Because McDonald presented evidence after his
motion for "directed verdict" was denied by the hearing body, we are not procedurally bound to
review only the evidence presented by disciplinary counsel, but can review the entire record of the
proceedings.

<p align="center">2

<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  McDonald argues he is entitled to all reasonable and
favorable inferences from the
evidence because he has denied any wrongdoing and witnesses are presumed to tell the truth.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  The presumption that a witness has told the truth is easily
rebuttable by evidence to the
contrary.  <u>See</u> <u>Andrews v. O'Hearn</u>, 387 N.W.2d 716, 730 (N.D. 1986).  This
presumption may
be rebutted by circumstantial evidence or a combination of both direct evidence and circumstantial
evidence.  <u>See</u> <u>Lovas v. St. Paul Ins. Companies</u>, 240 N.W.2d 53, 61 (N.D.
1976).  We have
recognized the concurrence of well-authenticated circumstances can be stronger evidence than
positive testimony unconfirmed by circumstances.  <u>Id.</u> If circumstantial evidence clearly
and
convincingly establishes that McDonald violated <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 3.3(a)</a>, the presumption
is
dissipated and McDonald is not entitled to the benefit of any favorable inferences.

<p align="center">3

<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  McDonald challenges several of the Board's findings of
fact in support of his argument
there is no clear and convincing evidence he violated <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 3.3(a)</a>.  The Board
found the "Notice and an Affidavit of Service [of the notice] was not filed with the Register of
Deeds of Slope County, as required by statute."  McDonald claims no pertinent statute was read
into the record and no expert testimony was given in the disciplinary proceedings to establish he
had not complied with the requirements for terminating mineral interests.  According to
McDonald, this error places all of the Board's factual findings in question because it is critical to
the Board's ultimate finding McDonald had a motive to, and did, create a false affidavit and falsify
evidence.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  Courts and administrative hearing bodies may take judicial
notice of state laws even if
the law is not formally submitted and received in evidence or requested to be officially noticed. 
<u>Walter v. North Dakota State Highway Com'r</u>, 391 N.W.2d 155, 158 (N.D. 1986).  The
Board,
through its hearing bodies, may do the same.  Under N.D.C.C. &#167; 38-18.1-06(4), "[a] copy
of
the notice and an affidavit of service of the notice must be recorded in the office of the register of
deeds of the county in which the mineral interest is located" to constitute prima facie evidence
that notice has been given to successfully terminate mineral interests.  <u>See also</u> <u><a
href="/court/opinions/980326.htm">Spring Creek
Ranch, LLC v. Svenberg</a></u>, 1999 ND 113, <a
href="/court/opinions/980326.htm#P11">&#182; 11</a>, 595 N.W.2d 323.  There is nothing
incorrect
or improper about the Board's finding McDonald did not comply with the statutory requirements
that would undermine the Board's other findings.

<p align="center">4

<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  McDonald argues the Board's finding that not all markings
on the envelope addressed
to the Albrights were made by Postal Service personnel is not supported by credible evidence.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P22"></a>22]  John Callinan, a United States postal inspector, testified
that while he believed the
envelope at some point in time probably did go through the mail, there were various discrepancies
on the face of the envelope.  Callinan noted the postage meter impression with no year in the date
was "very unusual and it's against our postal regulations to make a meter imprint without a full
date in it on first class mail."  He also testified postal records reflected the Form 3811, with a
publication date of December 1994, had a delivery date of May 12, 1995, "and sometime after the
delivery date . . . they would go to our supply centers for supply to the post offices around the
country."  Callinan testified a stamped impression on the lower left hand corner of the envelope
was customary, but the writing on the stamped impression was not.  According to Callinan, the
date written on the stamp for the first notice of the certified mail was "7-24," and the second
notice should have been five days later, but instead was noted as being attempted on "7-26." 
Callinan said 15 days after the first notice was given, the letter would be returned, but the return
date written was "7-31," only seven days after the first notice.  Callinan also testified he did not
believe a postal employee wrote "MLNA 65807" on the face of the envelope.  Although "MLNA"
is a Postal Service acronym for "Moved Left No Address," the five digit number following it is
supposed to be the zip code of the delivery number, and 65807 is the zip code for Springfield,
Missouri, not Chicago, Illinois.  We conclude there is credible evidence to support the Board's
finding that not all markings on the envelope were made by Postal Service personnel.

<p align="center">5

<p>[&#182;<a name="P23"></a>23]  McDonald argues the Board's finding that the envelope
was placed in the mail "on or
about July 20, 1996" is also not supported by the evidence.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P24"></a>24]  The evidence clearly shows the letter was not mailed on
July 20, 1993, as McDonald
initially claimed, but must have been mailed sometime after that date.  McDonald testified he
placed the Brooks file in his inactive files in September 1993 and did nothing more with it until
Brooks contacted him in April 1996.  McDonald then discovered the notice and affidavit of
service had not been recorded with the Register of Deeds.  Callinan testified the Form 3811 used
on the envelope would not have been available for use until "sometime after" May 12, 1995.  The
postmark date on the envelope was "JUL 20."  Considering the recent reactivation of the Brooks
file in April 1996, we believe the evidence strongly suggests the most plausible date the envelope
was placed in the mail was, as the Board found, July 20, 1996.

<p align="center">6

<p>[&#182;<a name="P25"></a>25]  McDonald contends the Board's finding that Russell did
not mail the envelope is not
supported by the evidence.  McDonald does not claim Hodell mailed the envelope, but argues
Russell, his part-time secretary, could have done so.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P26"></a>26]  The earliest the letter could have been mailed was
"sometime after" May 12, 1995, and
McDonald's records showed Russell was not employed by McDonald after June 2, 1995. 
McDonald placed the Brooks file with his inactive files in September 1993, and it seems highly
improbable Russell would open the Brooks inactive file and mail the envelope shortly before her
employment ended.  We believe the circumstantial evidence clearly supports the Board's finding
Russell did not mail the envelope.

<p align="center">7

<p>[&#182;<a name="P27"></a>27]  McDonald argues there is no clear and convincing
evidence he forged the envelope and
made a statement of fact and offered evidence he knew was false to the court in the quiet title
action.  The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence in this case
is that McDonald falsified the envelope to attempt to show compliance with N.D.C.C. ch.
38-18.1, and then used this evidence in an attempt to support Brooks' legal position in the
Albrights' quiet title action. 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P28"></a>28]  The evidence shows someone in McDonald's office
falsified the envelope to show a
notice of lapse of mineral interest was mailed to the Albrights on July 20, 1993.  McDonald
testified Hodell would not have had a motive, and would not have done so.  McDonald testified
Russell could have had a motive to falsify the mailing, but the only motive for Russell to do so
would be to cover up her mistake, and it seems highly improbable Russell would open an inactive
file almost two years after the fact to correct the mistake.  McDonald, as Russell's supervisor,
certainly had a more substantial motive to falsify the mailing.  Considering these circumstances
and the minuscule window between the time the Form 3811 might have been available for use in
Bowman and the time Russell left McDonald's employment, we agree with the Board that
McDonald had the most opportunity and strongest motive to falsify the mailing.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P29"></a>29]  We reject McDonald's contention the affidavit and
envelope were never actually
"submitted" to the court in the quiet title action because he conceded the mailing was defective
and thereafter relied on an alternative argument to support  Brooks' claim to the mineral interests. 
McDonald did file a false affidavit and a photocopy of the falsified mailing with the district court
in the quiet title action.  McDonald's eventual withdrawal of the falsified evidence, only after its
authenticity was challenged by opposing counsel, does not erase the ethical violation.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P30"></a>30]  We conclude there is clear and convincing circumstantial
evidence that McDonald
made a statement of fact and offered evidence which he knew was false to a court in violation of
<a href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/RULE3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 3.3(a)</a>.

<p align="center">B

<p>[&#182;<a name="P31"></a>31]  McDonald argues he was denied due process because his
hearing was held on
November 24, 1998, more than 14 months after the petition for discipline was filed, and the
hearing body did not issue its findings and recommendations until September 13, 1999, almost 10
months after the hearing.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P32"></a>32]  While the length of the delay is very troubling, we see no
"grave injustice" in the
14-month delay between the filing of the petition for discipline and the hearing.  <u><a

time was spent by both parties attempting to find Russell.  Although the hearing body exceeded
the 60-day time limit under <a href="/Court/Rules/Discipline/Rule3.1.htm">N.D.R. Lawyer
Discipl. 3.1(F)</a> for submitting its report, this time limit
is directory, rather than jurisdictional, and the failure to observe prescribed time intervals does not
abate a disciplinary proceeding.  <a href="/Court/Rules/Discipline/Rule3.5.htm">N.D.R. Lawyer

(Ind. 1977), the Indiana Supreme Court
said:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  Due process, as applied to disciplinary proceedings involving
attorneys,
requires notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard. . . .  Beyond these requirements,
there is no authority to suggest that the expiration of a time period would establish a
constitutional infirmity mandating dismissal of all charges.  There may be hypothetical factual
situations where this expiration of time destroys the fundamental fairness of the entire disciplinary
process; however, there is no evidence in the present case to warrant such
determination.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>(Citations omitted).  Likewise, we find nothing in this case to warrant a determination that the
delay in submitting the report destroyed the fundamental fairness of this disciplinary process.

<p align="center">III

<p>[&#182;<a name="P34"></a>34]  The Board recommends McDonald be suspended from the
practice of law for 60 days
and pay $3,307.18, one-half the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.  Disciplinary counsel argues
McDonald should be suspended for some period longer than six months, preferably one year, and
he should be required to pay the full costs of the disciplinary proceedings, $6,614.36.  McDonald
argues an admonition would be appropriate under the circumstances of this case.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P35"></a>35]  In determining the appropriate sanction, we are guided by
<a href="/Court/Rules/Standards/s6.htm">N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer
Sanctions 6.1</a>:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE><u>Rule 6.1. False statements, fraud, and
misrepresentation.</u></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances, upon application
of the
factors set out in <a href="/Court/Rules/Standards/s3.htm">N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer
Sanctions 3.0</a>, the following sanctions are generally
appropriate in cases involving conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice or that
involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation to a court:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  6.11   Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer, with the
intent to
deceive the court, makes a false statement, submits a false document, or improperly withholds
material information, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a party, or causes a
significant or potentially significant adverse effect on the legal
proceeding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><blockquote> 6.12   Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows
that false
statements or documents are being submitted to the court or that material information is
improperly being withheld, and takes no remedial action, and causes injury or potential injury to a
party to the legal proceeding, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal
proceeding.</blockquote>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P36"></a>36]  We reject the Board's recommendation that McDonald be
suspended from the practice
of law for 60 days.  An attorney's deliberate use of false testimony or falsified evidence in a
judicial proceeding is antithetical to the oath, the standards, and the ideals of the legal profession. 
<u>See</u> <u><a href="/court/opinions/960258.htm">Lamont</a></u>, 1997 ND 63, <a
href="/court/opinions/960258.htm#P19">&#182; 19</a>, 561 N.W.2d 650; <u><a
href="/court/opinions/900393.htm">Kaiser</a></u>, 484 N.W.2d at 109.  In <u><a
href="/court/opinions/900393.htm">Kaiser</a></u>, we
suspended an attorney from the practice of law for two years for testifying falsely under oath on
two occasions.  In that case, although the attorney admitted the violations of the Code of
Professional Responsibility, the attorney's first episode of false testimony "had a profound effect
on the outcome of that litigation, and on the decision by this court in that litigation" and resulted
in "profits of nearly two million dollars to Kaiser and his partners."  <a
href="/court/opinions/900393.htm"><u>Kaiser</u></a> at 107.  In <u><a
href="/court/opinions/960258.htm">Lamont</a></u>, we
suspended an attorney from the practice of law for 60 days for falsely testifying at a trial. 
However, the lawyer's testimony had no effect on the outcome of the trial and it did not result in
any benefit to himself personally or to his client.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/960258.htm">Lamont</a></u> at <a
href="/court/opinions/960258.htm#P20">&#182; 20</a>.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P37"></a>37]  In imposing a sanction, we consider the duty violated, the
lawyer's mental state, the
potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct, and the existence of aggravating or
mitigating factors.  <a href="/Court/Rules/Standards/s3.htm">N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer
Sanctions 3.0</a>.  Deliberately presenting false
information to a court is a very serious violation.  McDonald denied any wrongdoing, but the
Board and this Court have found he committed the violation.  McDonald has shown no remorse. 
There was the potential for a very serious miscarriage of justice because the false affidavit and
false document could have served as the basis for a taking by McDonald's client of the mineral
interests of the other party.  McDonald withdrew the falsified evidence from the court's
consideration, but only after its authenticity was challenged by opposing counsel, and the court
ultimately found in favor of the Albrights.  Even though the intentionally falsified evidence was
immaterial to the actual outcome of the litigation, it is nevertheless an extremely serious breach of
professional ethics.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/900393.htm">Kaiser</a></u> at 107-08.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P38"></a>38]  The Board found as mitigating factors under <a
href="/Court/Rules/Standards/s9.htm">N.D. Stds.
Imposing Lawyer Discipl. 9.32</a>
that McDonald has no prior disciplinary record, he was inexperienced in the practice of law, and
he "practiced by himself in a solo practice in a remote area."  While the absence of a prior
disciplinary record tilts in McDonald's favor, we do not agree the other factors are mitigating
circumstances in this case.  McDonald's unethical conduct occurred after he had been practicing
law for more than nine years.  "After so many years of practice, there is no question that he knew
better."  <u><a href="/court/opinions/900393.htm">Kaiser</a></u> at 108.  Moreover, attorneys
"in a solo practice in a remote area" are not subject
to a different standard of legal ethics.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P39"></a>39]  We conclude a suspension of six months and one day from
the practice of law is
appropriate in this case.<a name="FN_2_"><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P40"></a>40]  We also reject the Board's recommendation that
McDonald pay only one-half of the
costs of the disciplinary proceedings.  The Board recommended reducing the amount of costs
because the charge of violating <a href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/Rule8.1.htm">N.D.R. Prof.
Conduct 8.1</a> was dismissed.  However, the parties
agree most of the costs in this proceeding were incurred in attempting to locate Russell.  Russell's
whereabouts were just as important to McDonald's defense to the <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/Rule3.3.htm">N.D.R. Prof Conduct 3.3(a)</a>
violation as they were to McDonald's defense to the <a
href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/Rule8.1.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 8.1</a> violation.  We
conclude McDonald should pay the entire costs of the disciplinary proceeding.

<p align="center">IV

<p>[&#182;<a name="P41"></a>41]  We order McDonald be suspended from the practice of
law for six months and one day
commencing June 1, 2000.  McDonald is ordered to pay $6,614.36 for the costs and expenses of
the disciplinary proceedings.  Before he may practice law again, McDonald must apply for
reinstatement in accordance with <a href="/Court/Rules/Discipline/Rule4.5.htm">N.D. Lawyer
Discipl. 4.5</a>, including certification by the bar
examiners of McDonald's successful completion of the Multistate Professional Responsibility
Examination.

<p>1. </a>McDonald claimed Russell was also known as Carolyn Bruns and he did not know her
before
she began working in his office during the spring of 1993.  When it was discovered McDonald
represented Carolyn Bruns in a 1990 divorce matter, McDonald admitted he was "mixed up about
that," and said Bruns and Russell were two separate people.  Because of this, McDonald was also
charged with violating <a href="/Court/Rules/Conduct/Rule8.1.htm">N.D.R. Prof. Conduct
8.1</a> by knowingly making a false statement of
material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter.  The hearing body dismissed this charge,
reasoning "[t]he evidence shows confusion by all parties as to the identity of Carolyn Russell, but
there is no clear and convincing evidence of a knowing false statement on the part of McDonald." 
Disciplinary counsel does not challenge dismissal of this charge.  McDonald's argument that the
entire disciplinary proceeding was contaminated by this charge which was ultimately dismissed by
the hearing body is without merit.</a>
