<p align="center">Disciplinary Board v. Larson

<p align="center">Civil Nos. 930219 &amp; 930220

<p>Per Curiam.

<p>This is a disciplinary proceeding against Lorene Whitesides Larson, an attorney licensed to
practice law in North Dakota since 1942.  We order that Larson be disbarred for practicing law
while under suspension.  

<p>In <u>Disciplinary Bd. v. Larson</u>, 450 N.W.2d 771 (N.D. 1990) (<u>Larson I</u>),
Larson was suspended
from the practice of law for 90 days for mishandling client funds.  In <u>Disciplinary Bd. v.
Larson</u>,
485 N.W.2d 345 (N.D. 1992) (<u>Larson II</u>), Larson was suspended from the practice of
law for two
years for mishandling funds in an estate, and, concurrently, for seven months for practicing law
while under the suspension ordered in<u> Larson I</u>.  We stated in <u>Larson II</u> what a
suspended
attorney cannot do:  
  <blockquote>A suspended attorney must refrain from <u>all</u> facets of the practice of law. 
{Citations
omitted.}  In language drawn from Rule 118.12 of the Iowa Court Rules, we impose the
following terms on Larson's suspension for these violations:  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>{The} attorney suspended shall refrain, during such suspension, from all facets of
the
ordinary law practice including, but not limited to, the examination of abstracts;
consummation of real estate transactions; preparation of legal briefs, deeds, buy and sell
agreements, contracts, wills, and tax returns; and acting as a fiduciary.  
  </blockquote>

<p>485 N.W.2d at 350.  In January 1993, disciplinary counsel sought Larson's disbarment for
practicing law in violation of the<u> Larson II</u> suspension.  

<p>A hearing panel of the disciplinary board issued findings of fact and conclusions of law,
stating in
part:  
  <blockquote>{Larson} did engage in the practice of law subsequent to the effective date of her
suspension and contrary to the Supreme Court's order of suspension by:  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>a) Continuing to act as a fiduciary for James B. Bosh;  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b) Preparing Power of Attorneys and Living Will Declarations for Clara Budish
and Felix T.
Budish;  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>c) Preparing and filing with County Court a Personal Representative's Verified
Statement to
Close Estate in the estate of Theodore Jensen;  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>d) Filing for recording with the Walsh County Register of Deeds for purposes of
terminating a deceased joint tenant's ownership interest in real property certified copies of
death certificates of Gerald Widme, Albert Richotte, and Selmer Orlando Olson.  
  </blockquote>

<p>All of the above constituting conduct in violation of N.D.C.C. 27-14-02(2) and Rule 8.4(d) of
the
Rules of Professional Conduct.1

<p>The panel concluded that Larson "knowingly and intentionally continued to practice law
subsequent to the effective date of her suspension."  The panel recommended that Larson be
disbarred and that she "pay all costs and expenses of this proceeding including attorney fees
incurred by disciplinary counsel.  Disciplinary counsel shall file an affidavit as to these costs,
expenses and attorney fees and the amount in said affidavit shall constitute the amount to be
paid."  Under NDPRLDD 3.1 (F), the disciplinary board affirmed the hearing panel's findings and
recommendations and submitted them as its report to this court for decision.

<p>We explained our standard of review in disciplinary matters:  
  <blockquote>We review disciplinary proceedings against attorneys de novo on the record with
the
standard of proof being by clear and convincing evidence.  In reviewing the record, we
accord due weight to the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the hearing panel. 
However, this Court does not act as a mere "rubber stamp" approving the findings and
recommendations of the Disciplinary Board after a perfunctory review.  In determining what
discipline is warranted, each case must be decided on its own particular facts.  
  </blockquote>

<p><u>Larson I</u>, 450 N.W.2d at 773-74 (citations omitted).  These standards guide our
review here.

<p>Larson contends that, in filing a personal representative's verified statement to close the estate
of
Theodore Jensen, she relied on a county judge's advice "during a previous time" and "on a prior
estate" that the filing of that document "was an administrative act."  Larson cannot reasonably rely
on a county judge's characterization of an act in a previous probate when Larson's present lack of
authority to practice law was not effective.  The filing of probate documents clearly is "the
ordinary law practice" that a suspended attorney may not perform.  <u>Larson II</u>, 485
N.W.2d at
350.  

<p>Larson also contends that she relied on that county court's "advice with regard to continuing
to
assist James Bosh during a change-over period between her conservatorship and that of a
successor conservator."  Larson sought the county judge's permission to apply for public
assistance for Mr. Bosh after she was suspended.  Faced with the apparent immediate need by
Bosh, the county court reluctantly allowed Larson to apply.  Presented with this predicament by
Larson, the county court's permission to perform one act is not a legal justification.  Instead, as
in<u>
Larson II</u>, 485 N.W.2d at 351, this ploy appears to be another attempt by Larson to
"rationalize
her conduct by disingenuous legal arguments."    

<p>Larson argues that her conduct was not willful disobedience of the suspension order because
NDCC Ch. 27-14 does not define "willfully" and her conduct does not meet such common
dictionary definitions as "malicious," "done with evil intent," or done "with a bad motive or
purpose."  She argues that she cannot be disbarred because NDSILS 8.1(a) stipulates that she
"knowingly" or "intentionally" violated the disciplinary order, and, because those terms are not
defined, they must be given an ordinary meaning of willful, in the sense of having been done with
an "evil intent or bad purpose."  This, too, appears to be another attempt by Larson to "rationalize
her conduct by disingenuous legal arguments."  <u>Larson II</u>, 485 N.W.2d at 351.  As
<u>Judicial
Qualifications Comm'n v. Schirado</u>, 364 N.W.2d 50 (N.D. 1985); and <u>Matter of
Cieminski</u>, 270
N.W.2d 321 (N.D. 1978), illustrate, the term "willfully" in a professional disciplinary proceeding
means acts that were done in the exercise of the performer's free will and were not done under
coercion. 

<p>Larson's attorney concedes, and the record corroborates, that Larson violated this court's
suspension order, but pleads for leniency through other measures short of disbarment.  He asks
that we allow Larson to retire without being disbarred.  Sadly, we are unable to do so.  We are
deeply disappointed that, after a long legal career since 1942, Larson has twice violated
suspensions.  We conclude that we must disbar Larson.  

<p>This court's disciplinary orders are not intended to be "empty noise."  <u>McCullough v.
Swanson</u>,
245 N.W.2d 262, 265 (N.D. 1976).  Disciplinary orders are intended to protect the public. 
<u>See</u>
<u>Larson II</u>, 485 N.W.2d at 351.  NDSILS Standard 8 instructs:  
  <blockquote>Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances . . .:  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote><u>8.1</u> Disbarment is Generally Appropriate When a Lawyer:  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>(a)  intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and
such
violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the
profession; or  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>(b)  has been suspended for the same or similar misconduct, and intentionally or
knowingly
engages in further similar acts of misconduct that causes injury or potential injury to a
client, the public, the legal system, or the profession.  
  </blockquote>

<p>We have no difficulty in concluding, as did the disciplinary board and the hearing panel on this
record, that Larson "knowingly and intentionally continued to practice law subsequent to the
effective date of her suspension" in <u>Larson II</u>.  Therefore, NDSILS Standards 8.1(a) and
(b)
apply.  We agree with the disciplinary board and the hearing panel that no mitigating factors exist
in this case.  We order that Larson be immediately disbarred from the practice of law in the State
of North Dakota. 

<p>NDPRLDD 1.3(A)(9) says that "{m}isconduct shall be grounds for . . . {a}ssessment of costs
and
expenses of proceedings against the lawyer."  NDPRLDD 1.3(D) directs: "Unless otherwise
ordered by this court or the board, costs and expenses of all disability or discipline proceedings, . .
. , shall be assessed against the lawyer in any case where discipline is imposed."  Beginning with
<u>Matter of Pohlman</u>, 248 N.W.2d 833 (N.D. 1976), this court has required disciplined
attorneys to
pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings, including legal fees and expenses.  In <u>Larson
II</u>, we
observed:  "It is only fair that attorneys whose unethical conduct creates the need for a
disciplinary system contribute their direct share of the costs of maintaining that system."  485
N.W.2d at 351.  We concluded that "under NDPRLDD 1.3(D), costs and expenses should
ordinarily include reasonable attorney's fees of disciplinary counsel."  485 N.W.2d at 351.  The
disciplinary board has recommended that Larson be ordered to pay all costs and expenses of the
disciplinary proceeding, including attorney fees incurred by disciplinary counsel, and that the
amount claimed in an affidavit of disciplinary counsel "shall constitute the amount to be paid."  As
in <u>Larson II</u>, 485 N.W.2d at 351, we agree that Larson should be required to pay the
costs and
expenses of the disciplinary proceedings, including reasonable attorney fees of disciplinary
counsel.  However, given Larson's challenge to the reasonableness of disciplinary counsel's
claimed amounts, we direct a less open-ended approach.  

<p>A disciplined attorney should have a fair opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of
attorney
fees claimed by disciplinary counsel.  We, therefore, order Larson to pay the costs and expenses
of the disciplinary proceedings, including reasonable attorney fees of disciplinary counsel, in an
amount to be determined by the disciplinary board after affording Larson an adequate hearing
opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the attorney fees claimed by disciplinary counsel.  

<p>NDPRLDD 6.2(B) directs this court to cause publication of a notice of a lawyer's disbarment
in
the state bar association publication and in the official newspaper of the county where the lawyer
maintained an office for the practice of law.  NDPRLDD 6.2(C) directs this court to request the
presiding judge in the lawyer's judicial district to appoint a professional trustee, if necessary, under
NDPRLDD 6.4.  Rule 6.3(A) mandates that a disbarred lawyer give notice of the disbarment to
clients, co-counsel, and opposing counsel.  In this case, disciplinary counsel has requested wider
dissemination of notice of Larson's disbarment, especially to banks and nursing homes.  Under
NDPRLDD 6.3(B),2 we authorize disciplinary counsel to give additional notice of Larson's
disbarment as the disciplinary board directs.

<p>This case merits consideration of the possibility of earlier intervention for enforcement. 
Disciplinary counsel, the disciplinary board, and this court each have a role in the disciplinary
process.  Usually, the process is initiated by disciplinary counsel, the disciplinary board makes
findings and recommendations, and this court adjudicates.  Once discipline has been imposed,
enforcement will often be necessary.  As in this case, one method of enforcement will be that an
attorney who violates a disciplinary order can be disciplined again. 

<p>Still, there will often be additional enforcement means that may be more prompt, less
expensive,
and more effective.  NDPRLDD 2.4(B)(3) authorizes disciplinary counsel to "{p}rosecute
disciplinary . . . proceedings . . . before hearing bodies, the board and the court."  We do not
narrowly construe that authorization to confine disciplinary counsel only to prosecuting
proceedings for the imposition of a disciplinary order.  We construe the power and duty of
disciplinary counsel broadly to also authorize prosecution of enforcement actions by seeking such
relief as injunctions3 and punishment for contempt of court4 for noncompliance.  <u>See</u>,
<u>e.g.</u>, 7A
C.J.S., <u>Attorney and Client</u> 120(b) (1980); 7 Am.Jur.2d,<u> Attorneys at Law</u> 46,
97, 117 (1980);
Annotation, <u>Right to enjoin business competitor from unlicensed or otherwise illegal acts or
practices</u>, 90 A.L.R.2d 7  11{a} (1963).  Nor does this court need to act on or to consider
every
enforcement effort.  While a disciplinary order is in effect, judges of the district court can be
authorized or delegated to take appropriate action to enforce discipline and to protect the public. 
<u>See</u> NDPRLDD 1.1(A), 2.2, and 6.2(C); NDCC 27-05-06(1) and (3); N.D. Const. art.
VI,  3. 
Prompt local enforcement may often be more effective than additional discipline for a recalcitrant
subject.   

<p>We (1) order that Larson is immediately disbarred from the practice of law in North Dakota;
(2)
order Larson to pay the costs and expenses of the disciplinary proceedings, including reasonable
attorney fees of disciplinary counsel in an amount to be determined by the disciplinary board in
accordance with this opinion; and (3) authorize disciplinary counsel to disseminate notice of
Larson's disbarment as the disciplinary board directs.
