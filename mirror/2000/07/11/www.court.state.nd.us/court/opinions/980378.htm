<p align="center"><strong>Nos. <a name="6">980378 &amp; 980393</a></strong> 

<p><strong>Per Curiam.</strong> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  The Disciplinary Board petitions for disciplinary action
against Fintan L. Dooley and
recommends Dooley be reprimanded and ordered to make $16,666.65 in restitution to a former
client for violating N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a), and be reprimanded for violating N.D.R. Prof.
Conduct 1.7(a) and 1.16(e).  We conclude Dooley did not charge an unreasonable fee within the
meaning of N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a), and need not make restitution to the client, and he did
not have an impermissible conflict of interest in violation of N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a).  We
further conclude Dooley failed to return funds to a client upon termination of representation in
violation of N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e).  We order Dooley be reprimanded for that violation.

<p align="center">I

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  Fintan L. Dooley was admitted to practice law in North
Dakota on January 2, 1976.  On
September 23, 1987, Dooley entered into a one-third contingent fee agreement with Teddy Lee
Cahill to represent him on his claim for personal injuries suffered in a railroad accident.  Cahill had
received workers compensation benefits for his injuries, and Dooley, on May 18, 1989, executed
an agreement to represent the Workers Compensation Bureau under N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09
for
its subrogation interest in connection with any action involving Cahill's claims.  Dooley informed
Cahill by memo, "I ask you, after careful review of our fee agreement, to recognize that our fee
agreement entitles me to receive one-third of all recoveries made from the Bureau or from the
hospitals or from the railroads."  Cahill testified he understood and agreed the gross recovery
included the subrogation interest of the Bureau, and he would pay one-third of the gross recovery
as an attorney fee to Dooley.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  Dooley brought an action on Cahill's behalf against
Burlington Northern Railroad
Company for damages resulting from his personal injuries.  With Cahill's consent, Dooley retained
other lawyers to assist him with the action against Burlington Northern.  Dooley was responsible
for paying associate counsel fees, specifically agreeing with Cahill their fees "will be paid out of
my share of the recovery."  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  On January 26, 1994, Burlington Northern entered into a
$400,000 settlement
agreement with Cahill, Dooley, the Bureau, and Diane Schwandt.  Schwandt and Cahill live
together with their children as a family unit.  Cahill and Schwandt "released and discharged"
Burlington Northern "from any and all known and unknown . . . causes of actions" resulting from
the accident.  Although Schwandt was not a party to the action and was not married to Cahill, she
executed the release and settlement because, in the words of the release, "at the time of his injury
Teddy Lee Cahill was living with Diane Schwandt and she may have a consortium claim arising
out of this accident."  Before signing the settlement, a Bureau representative had the following
language added: "The Bureau by signing this release does not waive its right to assert its
subrogation interest to any claims for consortium."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  Burlington Northern's settlement with Cahill and the Bureau
was shared equally by them
in accordance with the provisions of N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09.  First, the lawyers received
one-third of the gross amount of recovery, less the retainer paid by Cahill, for a total of
$127,333.33.  The Bureau received its one-half share, less 25 percent for attorney fees and its
share of the costs, for a total of $118,595.57.  Cahill's lawyers received their advanced costs,
totaling $67,419.07.  Cahill received the remaining amount of $86,652.04.  The amount of
attorney fees payable by the Bureau under N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09 was not actually paid by
the
Bureau to Dooley, but the Bureau's share of the settlement was reduced by that amount.  The
effect of the allocation was Cahill paid the entire amount of attorney fees in accordance with his
agreement with Dooley, and was partially reimbursed by the reduction of the amount paid to the
Bureau.  This allocation resulted in Cahill effectively paying Dooley almost 42 percent of his share
of the settlement as an attorney fee.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  Dooley prepared a check on his trust account to the Bureau
for its $118,595.57 share,
but did not deliver it to the Bureau.  Instead, Dooley agreed to represent Schwandt in an action
against the Bureau to recover her consortium claim from part of Burlington Northern's settlement
payment.  The Bureau rejected Schwandt's consortium claim to the extent it would reduce the
amount payable to the Bureau on its subrogation interest.  Dooley wrote Schwandt to advise her
of the Bureau's refusal to allocate any part of its subrogation interest to her on a consortium
claim, and requested her and Cahill's agreement to "enter into contest with the North Dakota
Workers Compensation Bureau on our behalf to obtain free of [the] Bureau's subrogated claim
additional funds not already distributed to us but claimed by the Bureau."  Cahill and Schwandt
executed an "Acknowledgment" of this agreement on February 22, 1994.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  Dooley wrote to the Bureau and explained a new allocation
would be made for payment
of the settlement proceeds.  Dooley allocated $200,000 to Cahill for settlement of his claims and
allocated $200,000 to Schwandt for settlement of her loss of consortium claim.  Cahill's net
recovery and attorney fees and costs remained the same, but the Bureau's share was reduced to
one-half of Cahill's share and was further reduced by costs and the 25 percent statutory attorney
fee payable by the Bureau.  Dooley voided the check he had previously written to the Bureau, and
wrote two new checks on February 22, 1994.  Dooley wrote one to the Bureau for $43,595.57 in
settlement of its subrogation interest in Cahill's claim against Burlington Northern and wrote
another for $75,000 payable to himself in trust for Schwandt.  Dooley also informed the Bureau
he was preparing a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment against it for Schwandt's loss of
consortium claim.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  In April 1995, Cahill and Schwandt terminated Dooley's
representation and retained
Dale W. Moench to represent them for their claims against the Bureau.  On November 14, 1995,
Moench and Stephen D. Easton, a special assistant attorney general representing the Bureau,
wrote Dooley requesting he deliver the $75,000 and accrued interest to Schwandt and the
Bureau.  After Dooley failed to respond, Moench and Easton wrote in December 1995 and
repeated their request.  On January 5, 1996, Dooley responded:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>I have your letters.  Now, I again give notice of my attorney's lien in
these
funds contingent upon a decision favorable to Diane Schwandt based either upon loss of
consortium or her provision of services to a disabled person.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>I enclose copy of most recent statement received for this account
showing a
balance of $80,032.51.  I await either a court order or an agreement which pays me an agreeable
sum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>As a final alternative, under the statute I would agree to make
deposit of the
funds on the provision that no distribution of the one third I claim would be made without
opportunity for hearing or an agreement between the parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  Easton wrote Dooley's attorney on June 26, 1996, agreeing
to Dooley's suggestion the
funds be deposited with the district court.  The court ordered deposit of the funds on July 11,
1996, pending the outcome of the loss of consortium claim, and Dooley deposited the funds with
the court on August 8, 1996.  Schwandt's loss of consortium claim was resolved without Dooley's
further involvement.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  In November 1996, Dooley was served an amended
petition for discipline alleging he
had violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5 because he charged Cahill an unreasonable attorney fee,
and he had violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16 by failing to turn over the $75,000 and interest to
his client and the Bureau after he was terminated as Schwandt's attorney.  In June 1997, Dooley
was served a separate petition for discipline alleging he violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a) and
(c) by having an impermissible conflict of interest in representing Schwandt in her loss of
consortium action against the Bureau regarding the $75,000 placed in his trust account when he
had represented the Bureau on its subrogation interest in the same underlying matter.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  The dispute was heard by a hearing body of the
Disciplinary Board on November 18,
1997.  The hearing body filed its recommended findings and discipline on April 2, 1998, finding
Dooley had committed each violation and recommending he be reprimanded and ordered to make
$16,666.65 in restitution to Cahill for charging him an unreasonable fee.  The Disciplinary Board
adopted the hearing body's findings and recommendations for discipline and submitted its report
to this Court.  Dooley timely filed objections to the report and both parties presented briefs and
oral argument.  We consider the report of the Disciplinary Board under N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl.
3.1(G).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  What attorneys charge for their services is primarily a
matter of agreement between the
lawyer and the client.  ABA/BNA Lawyers' Manual On Professional Conduct, at 41:301 (1994)
(<u>ABA/BNA Manual</u>).  However, N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a) requires a lawyer's fee to
be
reasonable:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  (a) A lawyer's fee shall be reasonable.  The factors to be considered
in
determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE>  (1) The time and labor required, the
novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service
properly;</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE>  (2) The likelihood, if apparent to the
client, that the
acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the
lawyer;</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE>  (3) The fee customarily charged in the
locality for
similar legal services;</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Attorney fees charged in excess of the amount allowed under statute or rule are not
reasonable.

Moe</a></u>, 1999 ND 110, <a href="/court/opinions/980356.htm#P10">&#182;&#182;
10-16</a>, 594 N.W.2d 317;
<u>ABA/BNA Manual</u>, at 41:314.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  In finding Dooley charged Cahill an unreasonable fee, the
Disciplinary Board reasoned:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  Dooley's agreement with the Bureau provides: "I understand and
agree that
attorney fees and costs will be prorated in accordance with Section 65-01-09 of the North Dakota
Century Code (Supp. 1981)."  Dooley was obligated to charge and accept an attorney's fee of not
more than 25 percent of the gross amount of the Bureau's subrogation interest.  Dooley cannot
avoid this by contracting with Cahill for a fee of "one-third of all recoveries" including the
Bureau's subrogation interest.  The Hearing Body found such a contract results in Cahill being
charged and paying a fee that is excessive and unreasonable in violation of N.D.R. Prof. Conduct
1.5(a).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>We believe the Board's analysis is flawed.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  When Bureau claimants seek recovery for their injuries
from third persons, N.D.C.C.
&#167; 65-01-09 governs the Bureau's subrogation rights and provides the Bureau must pay
attorney fees on funds recovered for the Bureau based on given percentages.<a
name="FN_1_"><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> In <u><a
href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones v.
Pringle
&amp; Herigstad, P.C.</a></u>, 546 N.W.2d 837 (N.D. 1996), we interpreted N.D.C.C. &#167;
65-01-09 in
connection with a claim that the statute placed a cap on attorney fees a private attorney could
charge an injured party.  In <u><a href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones</a></u>, the
attorney charged the injured claimant in a third-party action
a 33 1/3 percent contingent fee.  After settlement, the Bureau suspended the injured claimant's
benefits.  The injured claimant objected to the attorney charging a 33 1/3 percent fee on the
portion of her settlement equal to the benefits suspended by the Bureau when the Bureau only
credited her with a 25 percent attorney fee on the suspended benefits.  The injured claimant
argued the attorney was entitled to only a 25 percent fee for the Bureau's subrogation interest,
including the suspended benefits.  We rejected her argument, and held N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09
does not regulate fees private attorneys may charge their injured clients in third-party
actions:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>The statute does not regulate attorney fees payable by injured
claimants on
funds they recover due to the efforts of their private attorneys.  The Bureau internally accounts
for attorney fees on suspended benefits by using the percentages required by N.D.C.C. &#167;
65-01-09; this practice does not impose a legal obligation on private attorneys to follow the same
procedure in calculating their attorney fees.  Only the legislature could impose such a requirement,
and it has not done so here.  We conclude N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09 requires the Bureau to pay
set attorney fees when funds are recovered for the Bureau from third parties through personal
injury actions; the statute does not regulate the fees private attorneys may charge clients other
than the Bureau in such actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><u><a href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones</a></u>, 546 N.W.2d at 841.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  The Board contends Dooley's fee violates the statute and
<u><a href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones</a></u> because Cahill did not
receive any part of the money which went to the Bureau and for which he paid Dooley a fee.  The
Board argues the statutory provision for attorney fees applies only to funds actually recovered for
the Bureau, and Dooley should likewise be limited to the statutory amount of attorney fees for the
funds he recovered for the Bureau.  Because the net effect of Dooley's fee agreement with Cahill
was to have Cahill pay for a portion of attorney fees for the Bureau's recovery, the Board argues
Dooley's fees were unreasonable.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  We reaffirm what we said in <u><a
href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones</a></u>: N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09 does not
regulate the fees
attorneys may charge private clients in third-party actions.  The statute only caps the amount of
attorney fees the Bureau must pay from its general fund to an attorney for recovery of its
subrogated interest.  The statute does not obligate an attorney to charge and accept as a fee not
more than 25 percent of the gross amount of the Bureau's subrogated interest.  Nothing in the
language of the statute or in <u><a href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones</a></u> forbids an
injured claimant from agreeing to pay attorney fees
for obtaining a portion of the Bureau's recovery of its subrogated interest.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  Although the net effect of Dooley's fee agreement with
Cahill is that Cahill paid
attorney fees for a portion of the Bureau's recovery, the record shows Dooley on several
occasions fully explained the nature of the fee agreement to Cahill.  The agreement was in writing
and stated the method by which the fee would be determined and whether expenses would be
deducted before or after the contingent fee was calculated.  <u>See</u> N.D.R. Prof. Conduct
1.5(c). 
Dooley performed hypothetical examples for Cahill of how funds would be disbursed if there was
a recovery.  Dooley explained to Cahill how the Bureau's subrogated interest would be calculated
and how the statutory attorney fees would be credited back to him.  There is no claim Cahill was
fraudulently induced into signing the fee agreement or there was overreaching on the part of
Dooley.  Indeed, Cahill testified, and the Board found, Cahill understood and agreed the gross
recovery included the Bureau's subrogation interest and he would pay Dooley one-third of the
gross recovery as an attorney fee.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  The fee arrangement may also be viewed as an agreement
for Cahill to pay Dooley an
almost 42 percent contingent fee for the amount of his own recovery.  The Board concedes a 42
percent contingent fee would not be unreasonable as a matter of law in this case.  Although there
is evidence Dooley charged more than the customary fee in this locality for these third-party
actions, the record shows there were difficult issues in the case, the case was time consuming, and
special expertise was required to perform the necessary legal services.  The costs incurred
exceeded $65,000, and undoubtedly would have been much higher if the case had gone to trial. 
The result of the litigation was favorable to Cahill.  There was testimony Dooley's effective
contingent fee of 42 percent was not unreasonable when compared to the fees customarily
charged in the locality for similar types of cases.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  Dooley fully disclosed to Cahill his fee would be one-third
of the gross amount of the
recovery, and Cahill voluntarily agreed to this arrangement.  We conclude Dooley did not charge
Cahill an unreasonable fee in violation of N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a), and Cahill is not entitled
to restitution.

<p align="center">B

<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  Conflicts of interest in a lawyer's representation of a client
are prohibited by N.D.R.
Prof. Conduct 1.7(a):

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  (a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the lawyer's ability to
consider,
recommend, or carry out a course of action on behalf of the client will be adversely affected by
the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer's own
interests.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P22"></a>22]  In concluding Dooley violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct
1.7(a), the Disciplinary Board
reasoned:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>Dooley cannot represent Schwandt for loss of consortium so as to
reduce the
amount of the Bureau's subrogation interest.  At the time he undertook to represent Schwandt he
was representing the Bureau and had a duty to the Bureau to recover for it the full amount of its
subrogation interest provided by statute.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>We disagree with the Board's finding Dooley had an impermissible conflict of interest in this
case.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P23"></a>23]  The hearing body, in addressing this issue, spoke of the
"duty" Dooley "owed the
Bureau as its lawyer."  However, Dooley's relationship with the Bureau was not, under these
circumstances, an ordinary attorney-client relationship.  As we noted in <u><a
href="/court/opinions/950335.htm">Jones</a></u>, 546 N.W.2d at 841
n.1, N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09 requires an injured worker who brings a third-party action to act
as
trustee for the Bureau's subrogation interest, and by implication also requires the injured
employee's attorney to represent the Bureau's subrogation interest.  Attorneys who bring
third-party actions for injured employees enter into a contractual relationship with the Bureau that
essentially sets forth the requirements of the statute.  Here, Dooley was required by the contract
to calculate the Bureau's interest according to the statute and remit that amount to the Bureau,
and he agreed the Bureau's subrogation interest "may not be reduced by settlement, compromise,
or judgment . . . ."  There was no fee negotiation, and Dooley was not free to decline this
mandatory relationship with the Bureau.  Courts analyzing similar statutorily-imposed obligations
upon attorneys have ruled no attorney-client relationship exists between the attorney and statutory
beneficiary.  <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>Curtis v. Simpson Chevrolet</u>, 348 F.Supp. 1062, 1068

the court, in addressing a contention a statute authorized government attorneys to represent Aid
to Dependent Children recipients as clients, the court said:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>The essence of this statutorily created relationship is that of
assignor-assignee. 
The mere fact that the assignor is required to cooperate with the attorney for the assignee does
not establish an attorney-client relationship.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>We have similarly defined the Bureau's subrogation interest under N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09
as "'a
legal operation by which a third person who pays a creditor succeeds to his rights against the
debtor as if he were his assignee.'" <u><a href="/court/opinions/930205.htm">Meyer v. North
Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau</a></u>, 512
N.W.2d 680, 682 (N.D. 1994) (quoting <u>Ness v. St. Aloisius Hospital</u>, 313 N.W.2d 781,
782
(N.D. 1981)).  Accordingly, we view Dooley's relationship with the Bureau not as an
attorney-client relationship, but as a contractual relationship imposed by operation of law.<a

<p>[&#182;<a name="P24"></a>24]  The Board has not cited, nor have we found, any reported
decision subjecting an
attorney to discipline under circumstances similar to those present in this case.  We have
discovered cases in the workers compensation context, however, where courts have rejected
claims that employee's attorneys should not be allowed to recoup their statutory percentage
attorney fees on the employer's insurance carrier's subrogated interest because the attorneys had a
conflict of interest by failing to protect, or by taking adverse action against, the carrier's
subrogated interest.  For example, in <u>Langley v. H. K. Ferguson Co.</u>, 542 N.E.2d 1200,
1204-05
(Ill. App. 1989), the court said:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>Although [the employer] asserts that [the employee's] counsel is not
entitled
to the attorney's fees in question because he failed in his alleged duty to protect the employer's
lien, we note . . . "the Workers' Compensation Act . . . provides that the duty of protecting the
employer's lien lies with the court".  We note too that employe[e]s' attorneys often represent
interests that are somewhat different from those of employers in cases such as this.  Indisputably
[the employer] must pay its fair share of the cost of recovering the benefits it has recovered.  It
cites neither law nor policy that justifies excusing it from paying the fee statutorily imposed for the
services and benefits it has received.</BLOCKQUOTE>

F.Supp. at 1068
(holding, although employee's attorney attempted to set aside subrogation lien, the employer's
insurance carrier must still pay proportionate part of attorney fees because "[i]n circumstances
such as this, a fee is not payable to counsel because he represents the employer with all the duties
attendant in the attorney-client relationship, but because a fund has been created through his
efforts from which the employer will benefit.").

<p>[&#182;<a name="P25"></a>25]  This Court has embraced the concept protection of the
Bureau's subrogation interest
lies primarily with the court.  In <u><a href="/court/opinions/930205.htm">Meyer</a></u>, 512
N.W.2d at 682, we ruled the Bureau's subrogation
interest does not extend to a spouse's claim for loss of consortium.  We also ruled injured workers
cannot shield settlement amounts from the Bureau's right of subrogation by arbitrarily allocating
amounts to the spouse's claim for loss of consortium:</u>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>To prevent arbitrary apportionment, the bureau should be
notified prior to
settlement so it can participate in any apportionment of settlement funds between the injured
employee and the employee's spouse.  Failure to notify the bureau prior to settlement, however,
does not automatically invalidate amounts apportioned to a spouse's loss of consortium claim. 
The inquiry is whether the apportionment is reasonable in light of the specific circumstances. 
Only amounts which are reasonably related to a spouse's injuries may be protected from the
bureau's right of subrogation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><u><a href="/court/opinions/930205.htm">Meyer</a></u>, 512 N.W.2d at 683.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P26"></a>26]  Dooley's actions in this case can be viewed as awkward
when judged against the
present legal setting.  Schwandt was not a party in Cahill's action against Burlington Northern, but
the record shows Dooley communicated to Cahill and Schwandt early during his representation
about a possible loss of consortium claim and often encouraged their marriage to strengthen that
claim.  It was not until November 5, 1992, that this Court ruled in <u>Butz v. World Wide,
Inc.</u>, 492
N.W.2d 88, 91 (N.D. 1992), a claim for loss of consortium must be joined with the underlying
personal injury suit or be permanently barred, absent a compelling justification for non-joinder. 
Apparently aware that in <u>Milde v. Leigh</u>, 75 N.D. 418, 28 N.W.2d 530 (1947), this
Court ruled
the statute of limitations for a consortium action begins to run at the time the spouse suffers the
loss, which is not necessarily the same time the injured spouse's action for personal injury accrues,
Burlington Northern mentioned Schwandt's loss of consortium claim in its settlement and release,
and required her express, signed waiver of any claim arising from Cahill's injury.  The Bureau also
signed the settlement and release and had inserted a clause stating it had not waived its
subrogation interest in any claims for consortium.  Although the Bureau was a party to the
settlement and release, no allocation of the settlement amount was made to Schwandt's
consortium claim at that time.  However, <u><a
href="/court/opinions/930205.htm">Meyer</a></u>,
which held the Bureau's subrogation interest
does not apply to consortium claims and set forth the proper procedure for allocation and
protection of the Bureau's subrogation interest, was not decided until February 23, 1994, after the
settlement was completed and one day after Dooley reissued checks reflecting the 50 percent
allocation for Schwandt's consortium claim.  Dooley cannot be faulted in hindsight for his actions
while the law in this area continued to evolve.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P27"></a>27]  Dooley's contractual and statutorily-imposed
obligation to protect the Bureau's
subrogation interest did not extend to Schwandt's claim for loss of consortium.  While Dooley's
allocation of 50 percent of the settlement to Schwandt's claim might have been challenged as
unreasonable, the Bureau did not object so far as this record shows.  Although any allocation to a
claim for loss of consortium will necessarily affect the Bureau's subrogation interest, we decline to
hold this procedure in itself amounts to either an impermissible conflict of interest within the
meaning of Rule 1.7(a), or a breach of the contractual and statutorily-imposed obligation to
protect the Bureau's subrogation interest.  To hold otherwise would require employment of
separate counsel to pursue a claim for loss of consortium in any case in which the Bureau has a
subrogation interest, even though the claim is subject to compulsory joinder.  This result would
directly contradict the reasoning for adopting compulsory joinder in these situations: "reduce[d]
litigation expenses for the parties."  <u>Butz</u>, 492 N.W.2d at 91.  The <u><a
href="/court/opinions/930205.htm">Meyer</a></u> alternatives of Bureau
participation in any apportionment of settlement funds or later judicial determination of the
reasonableness of the allocation provide the primary protection for the Bureau's subrogation
interest.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P28"></a>28]  Disciplinary counsel bears the burden of proving each
alleged violation of the
disciplinary rules by clear and convincing evidence.  <u>Disciplinary Action Against Larson</u>,
485
N.W.2d 345, 348 (N.D. 1992).  We conclude the Board failed to establish by clear and convincing
evidence that Dooley had an impermissible conflict of interest in violation of N.D.R. Prof.
Conduct 1.7(a). 

<p align="center">C

<p>[&#182;<a name="P29"></a>29]  Upon termination of representation, a lawyer has a duty
under N.D.R. Prof. Conduct
1.16(e) to surrender property to which the client is entitled:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  (e) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to
the
extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the
client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which
the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.  The
lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other
law.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><u>See also</u> <u><a href="960297.htm">Anseth</a></u>, 1997 ND 66,
<a href="960297.htm#P21">&#182;&#182; 21-27</a>, 562 N.W.2d 385.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P30"></a>30]  The Disciplinary Board found Dooley twice violated
this rule.  The Board concluded
Dooley, as the Bureau's lawyer, had no right to withhold $75,000 from the Bureau's subrogation
interest on Schwandt's behalf.  The Board further concluded Dooley, upon Schwandt's
termination of Dooley's representation, should have promptly paid over the money to Schwandt's
lawyer upon being advised of the termination of his representation and the identity of the lawyer
Schwandt retained for further representation of her claim.  Because we have concluded no
attorney-client relationship existed between Dooley and the Bureau, we find no violation of
N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e) by Dooley's withholding the $75,000 from the Bureau's
subrogation interest on Schwandt's behalf.  We agree with the Board Dooley violated the rule by
failing to promptly return to Schwandt and her new attorney those funds upon
notification of termination of representation.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P31"></a>31]  Schwandt terminated Dooley's representation in April
1995.  Schwandt's new attorney
and the Bureau's attorney asked for the funds in November and December 1995.  Dooley
responded by refusing to turn over the money without a court order or an agreement that paid
him "an agreeable sum."  He also claimed an attorney's lien on the funds.  Dooley did not
relinquish the funds until ordered to do so by the court in August 1996, about 15 months after
termination of representation.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P32"></a>32]  At the time Dooley refused to deliver the money to
Schwandt and the Bureau, Dooley
had not earned any fee from Schwandt and no payment of any fee was due him.  Moreover,
N.D.C.C. &#167; 35-20-08 allows an attorney a lien "for a general balance of compensation," and
Dooley would not have been entitled to the entire amount of $75,000 under the contingent fee
agreement he had with Schwandt.  We conclude Dooley violated N.D.R. Prof Conduct
1.16(e).

<p align="center">D

<p>[&#182;<a name="P33"></a>33]  Under N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 4.13,
reprimand is generally appropriate
when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with client property.  We therefore adopt the Disciplinary
Board's recommendation Dooley be reprimanded for violating N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e).

<p align="center">III

<p>[&#182;<a name="P34"></a>34]  We have considered the Disciplinary Board's report
and order Dooley be reprimanded
for violating N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(e).<br><br>

<p>1. </a>At the pertinent time, N.D.C.C. &#167; 65-01-09 provided in part:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>When an injury or death for which compensation is payable
under provisions
of this title shall have been sustained under circumstances creating in some person other than the
fund a legal liability to pay damages in respect thereto, the injured employee, or his dependents
may claim compensation under this title and proceed at law to recover damages against such other
person.  The fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or his dependents to
the extent of fifty percent of the damages recovered up to a maximum of the total amount it has
paid or would otherwise pay in the future in compensation and benefits for the injured employee. 
The bureau's subrogation interest may not be reduced by settlement, compromise, or judgment. . .
.  When there is recovery of damages in the action the costs of the action, exclusive of attorneys
fees, shall be prorated and adjusted on the percentage of the total subrogation interest of the
bureau recovered to the total recovery in the action.  The bureau shall pay attorney fees to the
injured employee's attorney from the bureau general fund as
follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>1. Twenty percent of the subrogation interest recovered for the
bureau when
legal action is not commenced.

<p><u></BLOCKQUOTE></u>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>2. Twenty-five percent of the subrogation interest recovered for
the bureau
when action is commenced and settled before judgment.

<p><u></BLOCKQUOTE></u>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>3. Thirty-three and one-third percent of the subrogation interest
recovered for
the bureau when recovered through judgment.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  The above provisions as to costs of the action and attorney
fees is effective
only when the injured employee advises the bureau in writing the name and address of his
attorney, and that he has employed such attorney for the purpose of collecting damages or of
bringing legal action for recovery of damages.  If a claimant fails to pay the bureau's subrogation
interest within thirty days of receipt of a recovery in a third party action, the bureau's subrogation
interest shall be the full amount of the damages recovered, up to a maximum of the total amount it
has paid or would otherwise pay in the future in compensation and benefits to the injured
employee or his dependents, and no costs or attorney fees will be paid from the bureau's
subrogation interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="N_2_"></a><a href="#FN_2_">
<p>2. </a>We recognize N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a) forbids an attorney from representing a
client if that
representation would be adversely affected by the lawyer's responsibilities to a "third party."  The
parties neither briefed nor argued the applicability of this language to the facts of this case. 
Therefore, we do not decide whether the Bureau is a "third party" within the meaning of the rule.
