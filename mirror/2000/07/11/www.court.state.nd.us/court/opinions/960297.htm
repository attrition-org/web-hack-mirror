<p align="center"><strong>Matter of Application for Disciplinary Action Against LeRoy P.
Anseth</strong> 
<h5 align="center">Civil No. 960297</h5>
<strong>Per Curiam.</strong> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  Disciplinary Counsel objects to the Disciplinary Board's 
dismissal of a formal disciplinary
case against LeRoy P. Anseth.  We exercise our inherent power to discipline, and we publicly
reprimand Anseth.

<p><u>I.  Background</u> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  Together, Anseth and Janet Zander practiced law in
Williston.  They contracted with the
Williston Regional Child Support Enforcement Unit (RCSEU) to review, sign and file documents
prepared by RCSEU staff, and to prepare and file more complicated documents for child-support
enforcement.  Zander did most of this work for the firm.    

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  On March 28, 1994, Zander, who was only an employee, told
Anseth she was quitting.  On
April 4, RCSEU notified Anseth it would terminate his contract effective May 4, and would
award a new contract to Zander.  RCSEU later extended Anseth's contract to July 31, 1994, so he
could complete his files, but it did not assign any new cases to him.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  Anseth continued work for RCSEU through July 31.  Soon
after that, he put nearly
twenty-five full boxes of former RCSEU files into off-site storage.  However, six files, lettered
cases A through F for identification, became the subject of this disciplinary complaint.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  Before September 1, Elaine Peterson, an RCSEU secretary,
called Anseth about case A, and
asked him to file original documents.  Anseth wrote back:  "On July 28, 1994 I received a letter
from Michon Sax which directed me to cease legal services on July 31, 1994.  I would like to
inform you that the letter specifically stated I was to cease doing anything on the case."  Anseth
never returned or filed the originals, and RCSEU had to file photocopies with the clerk of court
after getting permission from the court.  The same thing happened with case C, only RCSEU
could not file photocopies and had to start over by serving the summons and complaint a second
time.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  Peterson also contacted Anseth about case B, again asking
him to file original documents
thought to be in his office.  On August 24, Charles Neff, the opposing attorney in case B, wrote
Anseth notifying him original pleadings needed to be filed or he would move to dismiss.  Replying
to Neff on August 30, Anseth wrote that he checked the clerk's file for the originals and they had
been filed.  Anseth copied this letter to Zander.  However, Anseth did not tell Peterson the
originals had been filed, but merely repeated that he no longer worked for RCSEU.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  RCSEU believed case D also lacked original documents, but
it did not contact Anseth about
that case.  Administrator Barbara Johnson said RCSEU did not do so because a "pattern had been
set and it appeared the documents were not being filed and we were trying to get these files
completed with whatever means that we could."  Later, RCSEU obtained an order permitting
them to file photocopies with the clerk of court.  Still later, it discovered the original pleadings
had been filed already.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  Administrator Johnson contacted the State's Attorney about
Anseth, and he advised her
RCSEU's options were to file a complaint with the Disciplinary Board, get a court order, or just
try to finish the cases.  The governing board for RCSEU met to discuss the situation, and decided
to try to work with Anseth instead of filing a disciplinary complaint.  Michon Sax, Social Services
Director for Williams and McKenzie County, testified the board wanted to maintain a relationship
with Anseth because they still planned to work with him as a guardian ad litem and attorney for
indigent clients.  Sax hoped all along the Anseth situation was a "nightmare that would go away."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  On September 12, before cases A,B,C, and D were
completed, Sax wrote Anseth requesting
the "original court documents."  Anseth replied by letter on September 15:        
  <blockquote>I thank you for your letter of September 12, 1994.  I would like you to look at
your letter to
me of July 28, 1994 when you indicated you had terminated the contract to provide legal
services for the Williston Regional Child Support Enforcement Unit effective July 31, 1994
and in that letter you went on to specifically add that it was no longer my obligation to
provide legal services and that those services would <u>cease</u> July 31, 1994.  Those are your
words and not mine.  Attached to that letter of July 28, 1994 were specific lists of cases I
was to <u>cease</u>having any further obligations to.      
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>In your letter of September 12, 1994 you refer to Williams County, <u>a former
client</u>.  You
are now requesting some documents.  I am enclosing for you a copy of a plaque which
many lawyers have hanging in their office and a quote by Abe Lincoln that says, "A lawyer's
time and advice are his stock in trade".  I am assuming by your reference that you are a
<u>former client</u> and that you have no intention of paying for my time to locate things in my
file
which are now in storage.  If you wish to hire me at my regular billing rate as there is no
longer a contract in force I would be most happy to work for you.      
  </blockquote>

<p>Sax did not respond to Anseth's letter because RCSEU was not willing to pay again for work
he
had been paid to do.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  For case E, Anseth had prepared an order and filed it with
the court, but the court clerk
had returned it for corrections.  Anseth never filed a corrected order, and RCSEU had to buy a
trial transcript to enable Zander to do it.  Anseth admits this order "may have fallen through the
cracks." <strong> </strong> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  Case F had been heard on July 25, 1994, four working
days before Anseth's contract
ended.  Anseth failed to prepare the necessary order for it.  RCSEU bought a transcript to enable
Zander to prepare it.  Johnson testified that Anseth was to have prepared the order.  Anseth
testified that the order was to have been prepared by RCSEU staff, so the staff would have sent
the order to Zander if it was completed after July 31.  He also testified that four days was not a
typical turnaround to prepare an order.  The fact that Zander, and not RCSEU staff, eventually
prepared the order supports Johnson's testimony.  We find Anseth took the notes at the July 25
hearing on case F to prepare an order, had time to complete the order, and failed to do so without
notifying his client.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  John Cecil, a party to case F, frequently asked Craig
Burke, the RCSEU investigator, about
the status of his case.  Burke told Cecil he did not know what was happening on it, and he
suggested Cecil call Anseth.  Cecil called Anseth, and Anseth made a conference call with Cecil to
Burke.  When Burke found out Anseth was not representing either RCSEU or Cecil, he hung up
on them.  Anseth then contacted Burke's superior to inquire further.  The superior told Anseth
that RCSEU would get back to Cecil about the status of the case.  The hearing body found on this
incident:  "The inquiry Anseth made with various Social Services employees and administrative
personnel was professional and courteous."  Disciplinary Counsel does not contest this finding. 
We conclude Anseth's inquiries about case F did not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  Burke, the RCSEU investigator for some of these cases,
eventually filed the complaint
against Anseth with the Disciplinary Board.  An inquiry committee recommended a formal
disciplinary petition.  The hearing body found Anseth's conduct "did not violate any Rules of
Professional Conduct or any other professional rules, requiring discipline," and recommended
dismissal.  Without oral arguments or briefs, the Disciplinary Board adopted the findings and
recommendations of the hearing body and dismissed the disciplinary action.  Disciplinary Counsel
filed objections to that order of dismissal with this court.

<p><u>II.  Objections</u> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  This is the first time Disciplinary Counsel has objected to a
Disciplinary Board's dismissal. 
We must decide whether her objection calls for our review.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  Disciplinary Counsel argues she is entitled to object under
NDRLD 3.1(G).  Alternatively,
under our reserved powers in NDRLD 3.1(H), she contends we should exercise our inherent
authority to discipline.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  Generally, the parties to a disciplinary action can object to
a Disciplinary Board decision:     
  
  <blockquote><u>Review by the Court</u>.  The board shall promptly submit to the court a
report containing its
findings and recommendations on each matter heard other than those resulting in remand,
dismissal without appeal, consent probation without appeal, or reprimand without appeal. . .
.  A copy of the report submitted to the court must be served upon counsel, complainant,
and the lawyer.  Within 20 days of service of the report, the lawyer and counsel may file
objections to the report.      
  </blockquote>

<p>NDRLD 3.1(G).  Here, the Disciplinary Board dismissed the action against Anseth and did
not
file a report with this Court.  Disciplinary Counsel, however, argues that this disposition can be
appealed when she objects.  Thus, she argues, "an appeal was made and this matter is
appropriately before the Court under Rule 3.1(G)."  Because we choose to use our inherent
disciplinary power in this case, we do not decide whether Disciplinary Counsel properly appealed
this dismissal. 

<p><strong>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  </strong>Even if NDRLD 3.1(G) may not apply,
Disciplinary Counsel urges this court to review the
actions of the Disciplinary Board under our inherent authority to discipline lawyers reserved in
NDRLD 3.1(H).  Disciplinary Counsel submits this case is serious enough for use of that inherent
power.  We agree.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  This Court has a duty to maintain the integrity of the legal
profession by disciplining
lawyers.  <u>Matter of Lovell</u>, 292 N.W.2d 76, 82 (N.D. 1980).  To that end, we have
reserved the
power to discipline lawyers on our own initiative:  "Nothing in these rules prevents the court from
instituting disability or disciplinary proceedings on its own initiative."  NDRLD 3.1(H).  As this
Court explained long ago:        
  <blockquote>The power to discipline attorneys, who are officers of the court, is an inherent and
incidental power in courts of record, and one which is essential to an orderly discharge of
judicial functions.      
  </blockquote>

<p><u>In re Simpson</u>, 83 N.W. 541, 553 (N.D. 1900).  We conclude this case calls for us to
exercise our
"inherent and incidental power."

<p><u>III.  Misconduct</u> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  Disciplinary Counsel objects to the hearing body's decision
that Anseth did not breach the
Rules of Professional Conduct.  She argues RCSEU did not have to hire Anseth again to retrieve
its own documents from his files, and did not have to pay to get Anseth to comply with ethical
standards.  She asserts that Anseth failed to respond helpfully or meaningfully to RCSEU's
requests, and contends he was obligated to minimize any harm that  ending his representation
would cause his client.  Disciplinary Counsel asserts RCSEU had a "vital" right to discharge an
attorney without having to pay two attorneys for the same services.  Disciplinary Counsel submits
that Anseth's actions did not reasonably protect RCSEU's interests and that his conduct reflects
badly on the legal profession.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  We review disciplinary actions against attorneys anew 
under a clear and convincing
standard of proof.  <u>Disciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court v. McKennett</u>, 349 N.W.2d 29, 31
(N.D.
1984).  Although we give due weight to the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the
Disciplinary Board, we do not automatically accept those findings; we decide each case on its
own facts.  <a href="/court/opinions/950283.htm">Disciplinary Bd. v. Gray</a>, 544 N.W.2d
168, 171 (N.D. 1996); <u>Disciplinary Action
Against Britton</u>, 484 N.W.2d 110, 111 (N.D. 1992).  Here, we conclude Anseth clearly
violated
duties to RCSEU upon termination of his services.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  Anseth's ethical duties to RCSEU, as a governmental
entity, were the same as to an
individual client.  <u>See</u> NDRPC 1.18 cmt.  Anseth's obligations were clear:        
  <blockquote>Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent
reasonably
practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client,
allowing time for employment of other counsel, <u>surrendering papers and property to which
the client is entitled</u> and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. 
The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.      
  </blockquote>

<p>NDRPC 1.16(e) (emphasis supplied).  Anseth was obligated to surrender the original
documents
for cases A, B, C, and D.  Anseth was obligated to take "steps to the extent reasonably practicable
to protect [RCSEU's] interests" on cases E and F by, at least, completing work undertaken within
the allotted time or informing his client clearly about their incomplete status.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P22"></a>22]  We are not concerned with cases B and D because Anseth
no longer had those originals. 
Although Anseth should have been more informative in his replies to RCSEU's inquiries, he was
not obligated to return documents he no longer had.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P23"></a>23]  For cases A and C, though, Anseth had a clear duty to turn
the originals over to RCSEU. 
"The lawyer who has withdrawn or has been discharged by the client has a duty to surrender
promptly all papers and other property to which the client is entitled."  Annotated Model Rules of
Professional Conduct Rule 1.16(d) annot. at 256 (3d ed. 1996); <u>see</u> <u>also</u>
<u>Matter of Lyles</u>, 477
S.E.2d 105, 106-07 (Ga. 1996)(suspending attorney in part for failure to return requested client
documents); <u>In re McCarty</u>, 665 A.2d 885, 887 (Vt. 1995)(publicly reprimanding
attorney for
failing to return client property after termination of representation).  While Anseth did not have to
bear the cost of returning the documents, he should have made them readily available for RCSEU
personnel to pick up.  <u>See</u> Illinois State Bar Ass'n, Comm. on Prof'l Ethics, Op. 94-14
(1995)("All
original papers delivered to the lawyer by the client must be returned to the client."); Maine State
Bar Ass'n, Prof'l Ethics Comm'n, Op. 120 (1991)(requiring attorney to make papers available to
client, but not requiring attorney to bear delivery costs).  Anseth should have done more to return
RCSEU's documents.

<p><strong>[&#182;<a name="P24"></a>24]  </strong>Unfortunately, both the Disciplinary
Board and the hearing body ignored case E and did
not make any findings about it.  Anseth's inaction on case E is not acceptable; that it "may have
fallen through the cracks" is not a valid excuse.  His inattention was negligent, at least.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P25"></a>25]  We do not believe Anseth actually had to prepare the case
E order after July 31. 
<u>See</u>NDRPC 1.16(e) cmt. ("Whether or not a lawyer for an organization may under
certain
unusual circumstances have a legal obligation to the organization after withdrawing or being
discharged . . . is beyond the scope of these Rules.")  However, before the end of his
representation, he should have adequately informed RCSEU about the incomplete status of that
case.  <u>See</u> NDRPC 1.4 (requiring attorneys to keep clients reasonably informed about
status of
matter); <u>In re Ambrose</u>, 442 N.E.2d 900, 902 (Ill. 1982)(reprimanding attorney in part
for failure
to inform client about incomplete status of case upon withdrawal of representation); <u><a
href="/court/opinions/930218.htm">Disciplinary
Bd. v. Robb</a></u>, 506 N.W.2d 714 (N.D. 1993)(publicly reprimanding attorney for failure to
keep
client reasonably informed about status of bankruptcy matter).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P26"></a>26]  We reach the same conclusion for case F.  As we explained
in <u>Disciplinary Bd. v.
Amundson</u>, 297 N.W.2d 433, 443-44 (N.D. 1980):  "Public trust in the legal profession is a
necessity and as a consequence lawyers traditionally have been held to a higher standard."  By
failing to protect RCSEU's interests on cases E and F, Anseth breached his obligation to "take
steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests." 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P27"></a>27]  Anseth blames RCSEU for a lack of communication on
these six cases.  Anseth says he
promptly responded to RCSEU's requests for documents, but RCSEU did not contact him again. 
On the prepared documents, he points out that RCSEU did not follow its usual practice of
checking an order's status.  We are not persuaded because RCSEU tried several times to
communicate its needs to Anseth, but was met each time with his stubborn and uninformative
refusal to cooperate in any way without being paid.  Anseth, not RCSEU, had the affirmative duty
to "take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests."

<p><u>IV.  Sanction</u> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P28"></a>28]  Disciplinary Counsel urges the most appropriate sanction
for Anseth's misconduct is a short
period of suspension followed by probation.  She contends that "Anseth knowingly engaged in
conduct that violated his duty to the client upon termination of his employment, with serious or
potentially serious injury to the client, the public, and the legal system."  She suggests disbarment
might even be appropriate, if we found Anseth intended to enrich himself by seeking payment for
simply returning the client's own documents.  Disciplinary Counsel urges more than a reprimand is
needed because Anseth's misconduct was affirmative and deliberate, not merely negligent.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P29"></a>29]  To formulate a suitable sanction for a lawyer's misconduct,
we consider:  (1) the ethical
duty violated by the lawyer; (2) the lawyer's mental state; (3) the extent of actual or potential
injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and (4) the existence of aggravating or mitigating
factors.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/950406.htm">Disciplinary Action Against LaQua</a></u>,
548 N.W.2d 372, 374 (N.D. 1996); NDSILS 3.0. 
The range of sanctions for Anseth's misconduct is suggested in North Dakota Standard for
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 7.0:      
  <blockquote>Violations of Duties Owed to the Profession      
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances, upon application of the factors set
out in
Standard 3.0, the following sanctions are generally appropriate in cases involving . . .
improper withdrawal from representation . . . .       
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>7.1 Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in
conduct that is
a violation of a duty owed to the profession with the intent to obtain a benefit for the lawyer
or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, the public, or the
legal system.      
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>7.2 Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in
conduct that is
a violation of a duty owed to the profession and causes injury or potential injury to a client,
the public, or the legal system.      
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>7.3  Reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in
conduct that
is a violation of a duty owed to the profession and causes injury or potential injury to a
client, the public, or the legal system.      
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>7.4  Admonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in an isolated
instance of
negligence in determining whether the lawyer's conduct violates a duty owed to the
profession, and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a client, the public, or the
legal system.      
  </blockquote>

<p>Generally, disbarment and suspension are the appropriate sanctions for knowing misconduct,
and
reprimand and admonition are appropriate for negligent misconduct.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P30"></a>30]  Here, suspension would ordinarily be appropriate for
Anseth's knowing failure to fulfill his
obligations to RCSEU.  However, we find his misconduct is mitigated by his cooperation with the
Disciplinary Board and the absence of any prior disciplinary record.  <u>See</u>NDSILS 9.32(a)
and (e). 
Disciplinary Counsel argues that Anseth's failure to admit the seriousness of his conduct is an
aggravating factor that warrants a stiffer sanction.  Yet, Anseth grudgingly conceded one file had
"fallen through the cracks."  On the whole, we conclude that Anseth's failure to understand the
seriousness of his misconduct is also largely balanced by the mitigating factors, and that the most
appropriate sanction for Anseth is a public reprimand.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P31"></a>31]  We direct that LeRoy P. Anseth be publicly reprimanded
for his misconduct, and that
Anseth pay the costs of this disciplinary proceeding to be determined by the Disciplinary Board.
