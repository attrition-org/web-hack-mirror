<p align="center">Tooley v. Alm

<p align="center">Civil No. 930358

<p>SANDSTROM, Justice.

<p>The plaintiff in this action, Darrell Tooley, seeks certification of a class action in order to
compel
the North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau to notify and screen claimants for potential
permanent partial impairment awards.  Tooley appeals from a judgment dismissing his action for a
declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus against the bureau and its executive director.  We
hold Tooley has not shown a clear legal right to the relief requested and has an adequate legal
remedy which has not been exhausted.  We therefore affirm the district court judgment.

<p>I

<p>On September 3, 1987, Tooley was injured in the course of his employment and filed a claim
with
the bureau for benefits.  The bureau accepted Tooley's claim and paid him benefits of $26,348.59
for disability, doctors, hospital, drugs, rehabilitation, and miscellaneous expenses.  As of May 5,
1991, the bureau had not awarded Tooley any benefits for permanent partial impairment.

<p>Tooley, "on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated," brought this action against the
bureau and its executive director for declaratory relief and a writ of mandamus, alleging he and
other members of a proposed class were entitled to notice of their right to request a permanent
partial impairment award and to have an evaluation for permanent partial impairment.  Tooley
moved to certify the lawsuit as a class action, asserting he and the other proposed class members
have reached maximum medical improvement and have a clear legal right to notification of their
right to request an award for permanent partial impairment and to an impairment evaluation.

<p>The bureau moved to dismiss Tooley's action, asserting the district court lacked jurisdiction
because Tooley had an adequate remedy at law and had failed to exhaust his administrative
remedies.  The district court agreed and dismissed Tooley's complaint, concluding it lacked
jurisdiction because an administrative appeal provided him with a plain, speedy, and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law and he had not exhausted his administrative remedies. 
Tooley appealed.

<p>II

<p>We consider Tooley's arguments in the context of the district court's authority to grant
declaratory relief and a writ of mandamus.  Art. VI,  8, of the North Dakota Constitution grants
the district court original jurisdiction of all causes, except as otherwise provided by law,1
appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by law or by rule of the Supreme Court, and jurisdiction
to issue necessary writs.  <u>Rudnick v. City of Jamestown</u>, 463 N.W.2d 632, 635 (N.D.
1990).

<p>Chapter 32-23, N.D.C.C., authorizes courts of record to issue declaratory judgments. 
N.D.C.C. 
32-23-02 provides "any person . . . whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a
statute . . . may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the . . .
statute . . . and may obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder."  A
court's authority to grant declaratory relief, however, requires the exhaustion of administrative
remedies.  <u>Transportation Division of Fargo Chamber of Commerce v. Sandstrom</u>, 337
N.W.2d
160, 162-63 (N.D. 1983); <u>Shark Brothers Inc. v. Cass County</u>, 256 N.W.2d 701, 705-06
(N.D.
1977).  <u>See</u> <u>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Conrad</u>, 410 N.W.2d 124, 126 (N.D.
1987).

<p>Tooley cites <u>Shark Brothers</u> to argue the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies is not
firmly
established in the administrative agency context.  In <u>Shark Brothers</u>, however, this Court
affirmed
the dismissal of an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to restrain a 1976 tax assessment of
certain property.  Recognizing the use of the property had not changed from prior tax years and
the property's taxable status was involved in both a pending administrative appeal for the prior
years and the action for declaratory judgment, this Court said:  
  <blockquote>"We do not favor or encourage, nor can we sustain, bifurcated self-induced or
self-initiated
procedures, one in the administrative process and one in the judicial process covering the
same legal questions.  
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>"If such bifurcated procedures were encouraged or sustained, it would create
duplication,
and uncertainty, and waste manpower and money, with no appreciable result, and all
without improving the administration of justice.  If one side of a proceeding were permitted
to proceed both in the administrative channels and the judicial channels at the same time the
other side could also resort to the same procedure.  The result would be endless confusion,
which we can ill afford."  
  </blockquote>

<p><u>Shark Brothers</u> at 705-06.

<p>In <u>Sandstrom</u>, this Court reviewed the dismissal of an action for injunctive and
declaratory relief
challenging a rate increase which had been approved by the Public Service Commission.  The
Court reiterated its position on bifurcated proceedings and affirmed the dismissal because the
plaintiff failed to follow the statutory procedure for appealing the rate increase.  <u>SeeAmerada
Hess Corp. v. Conrad</u>, 410 N.W.2d 124, 126-27 n.1 (N.D. 1987) (doubt expressed about
propriety of declaratory judgment for questions arising from tax commissioner's assessment of
additional oil and gas production taxes).  <u>Compare</u> <u>In Interest of McMullen</u>, 470
N.W.2d 196,
199-200 (N.D. 1991) (declaratory relief available to resolve issue which is not subject to
administrative determination).  Contrary to Tooley's argument, the requirement for exhaustion of
remedies is well established for administrative decisions.

<p>Similar principles govern the availability of mandamus to compel performance of an act by an
administrative agency.  N.D.C.C.  32-34-01 authorizes a district court to issue a writ of
mandamus to "any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person to compel the performance of
an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty."  Mandamus may be used to compel
performance of a ministerial duty, but may not be used to compel performance of discretionary
acts.  <u>Lund v. North Dakota Highway Department</u>, 403 N.W.2d 25, 27 (N.D. 1987).  An
applicant for a writ of mandamus must demonstrate a clear legal right to the performance of an
act and must have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. 
<u>Old
Broadway Corp. v. Backes</u>, 450 N.W.2d 734, 736 (N.D. 1990).  Mandamus is not available
if an
appeal is authorized from an adverse decision of an administrative agency.  <u>Newman Signs,
Inc. v.
Hjelle</u>, 300 N.W.2d 860, 862 (N.D. 1980).

<p>In <u>Wallace v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau</u>, 69 N.D. 165, 284
N.W. 420, 423
(1939), this Court affirmed the granting of a writ of mandamus to compel the bureau to allow a
claimant to inspect the bureau's medical records and files regarding termination of his benefits,
because the claimant was entitled to inspect records which the bureau had used as a basis to
terminate his benefits and he had no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law.  <u>Compare</u> <u>Manikowske v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation
Bureau</u>, 373
N.W.2d 884, 887 (N.D. 1985) (writ of certiorari not available to compel full evidentiary hearing
on claim for workers' compensation benefits where claimant failed to timely appeal denial of
benefits after informal hearing). <u> Wallace</u> illustrates mandamus is available to compel an
administrative agency to perform a ministerial duty which the law requires the agency to perform,
but mandamus is not available to direct how, or in whose favor, the agency decides a case. 
<u>Mogaard v. City of Garrison</u>, 47 N.D. 468, 182 N.W. 758, 760 (1921).

<p>Although N.D.C.C.  65-01-01 and 65-05-06 abolish all civil actions and claims for relief for
personal injuries by employees against employers in most hazardous employment and all
jurisdiction of courts over those causes, a petition for a writ of mandamus seeks to compel
performance of a ministerial duty which the law requires to be performed and is not an action for
personal injuries.  <u>Compare</u> <u>Barsness v. General Diesel &amp; Equipment</u>, 422
N.W.2d 819, 823-24
(N.D. 1988) (action based upon express contract of indemnification between employer and
third-party tortfeasor is exception to exclusive remedy rule of workers compensation, because it is
an action on a separate legal claim based upon contract and not an action for damages).  Those
statutes do not preclude the use of mandamus to compel the bureau to perform a ministerial act
which the law specifically requires, if there is no right to appeal from the bureau's failure to
perform the act.  <u>Wallace</u>.  <u>See generally</u> 82 Am.Jur.2d, Workers' Compensation 
525, 696
(1992); 52 Am.Jur.2d, Mandamus  162 et seq. (1970).

<p>We decline to hold mandamus is never available to compel the bureau to perform an act
which the
law specifically requires it to perform.  <u>SeeInvestment Rarities, Inc. v. Bottineau County
Water
Resource District</u>, 396 N.W.2d 746, 748 (N.D. 1986) (although there was no statutory
authority
for appeal, administrative determination by State Engineer could be reviewed through special
proceedings such as mandamus, certiorari, or prohibition).  Rather, the inquiry is on whether a
petitioner for mandamus has a clear legal right to compel the bureau to perform an act and
whether the petitioner has an adequate legal remedy in the ordinary course of law, which both
require consideration of the nature of Tooley's underlying claim.

<p>III

<p>A

<p>Tooley asserts the bureau must notify him and others in his proposed class of their right to
request
an award for permanent partial impairment and of their right to an impairment evaluation under
N.D.C.C.  65-05-12 and N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25.  He also asserts the bureau must send potential
impairment claimants the form required by N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25(5).

<p>N.D.C.C.  65-01-02(26) defines "permanent impairment" as: 

<p>"the loss of or loss of use of a member of the body existing after the date of maximum medical
improvement or recovery, and includes disfigurement resulting from an injury if such
disfigurement diminishes the ability of the employee to obtain employment.  The loss must be
determined in accordance with and based upon the most current edition of the American medical
association's 'Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment'.  Any impairment award, not
expressly contemplated within the American medical association's 'Guides to the Evaluation of
Permanent Impairment', must be determined by clear and convincing medical evidence."

<p>N.D.C.C.  65-05-13 authorizes impairment awards for scheduled injuries for the permanent
loss
of a member.  N.D.C.C.  65-05-12 authorizes permanent impairment awards for  nonscheduled
injuries and requires the injured employee's doctor to report "any rating of any impairment of
function as the result of the injury on the date of maximum medical improvement, except for total
losses claimed under section 65-05-13."

<p>N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25 outlines the required procedure for resolving a "dispute" about the
percentage of an employee's permanent impairment.  N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25(1) defines "dispute"
to mean "an employee has reached maximum medical improvement in connection with a work
injury, the employee's doctor has filed with the bureau a report of the rating of impairment of
function, and the bureau fails or refuses to award permanent impairment benefits based upon that
report within thirty days of receipt of the report."  N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25(5) provides:  
  <blockquote>"An employee is not entitled to an award for permanent impairment until after the
employee
is at maximum medical improvement.  Upon receipt of a report from the employee's doctor
indicating the employee has reached maximum medical improvement and evidence the
employee has a permanent impairment as a result of the work injury, the bureau shall send a
form to the employee on which the employee shall identify all body parts the employee
believes are permanently impaired due to the work injury.  The employee must complete the
form and return it to the bureau.  The bureau shall then forward the report to the employee's
doctor and instruct the doctor to examine the employee and report to the bureau any rating
of impairment of function resulting from the work injury."  
  </blockquote>

<p>Although we construe the Workers' Compensation law liberally in favor of injured workers to
promote their well-being (<u>Kroeplin v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau</u>,
415
N.W.2d 807, 809 (N.D. 1987)), the plain language of those statutes and regulations does not
require the bureau to affirmatively notify claimants of the availability of impairment benefits. 
<u>Compare</u> <u>Clark v. Chrysler Corp.</u>, 342 So.2d 902 (Ala. 1977) (no language in
compensation act
which indicates, or even suggests, the employer is under an obligation to advise an employee of
workmen's compensation benefits); <u>Devlin v. Galusha, Higgins &amp; Galusha</u>, 202
Mont. 134, 655
P.2d 979, 981 (1982) (employer under no duty to inform claimant of rights);<u> Roberts v.
Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board</u>, 104 Pa.Cmwlth. 114, 521 A.2d 100, 103 (1987)
(workers' compensation law does not place affirmative duty on employer to advise claimant of
rights under act).  <u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>Permanente Medical Group/Kaiser Foundation
Hospitals v. Workers'
Compensation Appeals Board</u>, 171 Cal.App.3d 1171, 217 Cal.Rptr. 873, 878 (Cal.App.3d
1985)
(employer has statutory duty to notify employee of possible entitlement to benefits); <u>Gall
Silica
Mining Co. v. Sheffield</u>, 401 So.2d 1169, 1170 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (employer has
statutory
duty to inform worker of possible entitlement to wage loss and other benefits and of obligation to
report a claimed wage loss); <u>Bennett v. Scrivner, Inc.</u>, 694 P.2d 932, 934 (Okla. 1985)
(employer
has statutory duty to advise employee of right to file compensation claim and failure to notify tolls
statute of limitations).  The absence of any such affirmative duty on the part of the bureau to
notify potential claimants is in harmony with "the time-honored principle that all persons are
presumed to know the law." <u> State v. Carpenter</u>, 301 N.W.2d 106, 110 (N.D. 1980). 
Employers
do, however, have a statutory duty to display, in a conspicuous manner reasonably calculated to
inform employees, a certificate showing workers' compensation coverage.  N.D.C.C.  65-04-04. 
We conclude, in the absence of a contrary statutory or regulatory duty, claimants do not have a
clear legal right to require the bureau to notify them of the availability of impairment benefits.

<p>Under N.D.C.C.  65-05-12 and N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25, the bureau is to provide an
impairment
evaluation and to send an impairment form to the claimant upon a report by the claimant's doctor
indicating a "rating of any impairment of function as a result of the injury on the date of maximum
medical improvement" and a dispute about the percentage of impairment.  If there is medical
evidence of impairment and a dispute about the percentage of impairment, N.D.A.C. 
92-01-02-25 governs the procedure for resolving the dispute, including the use of an impairment
form.  <u>See</u> <u>also</u> N.D.C.C.  65-05-12.1.  Under the regulation, the bureau's
obligation to send an
impairment form to a claimant does not arise until there is medical evidence of impairment and a
dispute about the percentage of impairment.

<p>The bureau has interpreted those provisions to entitle a claimant to an impairment evaluation
and
award if the claimant's doctor reports maximum medical improvement and there is medical
evidence of impairment.  According to the bureau, an award of disability or rehabilitation benefits
does not itself require the bureau to send a claimant an impairment form, to schedule an
impairment evaluation, or to award impairment benefits.  <u>See</u> <u>Kroeplin v. North
Dakota
Workmen's Compensation Bureau</u>, 415 N.W.2d 807, 809 (N.D. 1987) (an award for
disability
compensates for loss of earning capacity, while an award for impairment compensates for
impairment, loss, loss of use, or partial loss of use of a portion of the body); N.D.C.C. 
65-01-02(13) ("Disability" means "loss of earnings capacity.").  Instead, the bureau interprets
N.D.C.C.  65-05-12 and N.D.A.C.  92-01-02-25 to require a doctor's report of maximum medical
improvement and medical evidence of impairment before an impairment evaluation or impairment
form is warranted in order to "husband its resources and spend the sums for a doctor to evaluate
an employee only if there is reasonable cause to believe an impairment may exist."  The bureau's
interpretation of those requirements is consistent with the statutory language and is entitled to
deference (<u>Holtz v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau</u>, 479 N.W.2d 469, 470
(N.D.
1992)), and conforms with the claimant's burden of proving entitlement to participate in the fund. 
N.D.C.C.  65-01-11. <u> See</u> <u>Clark v. Chrysler Corp.</u>; <u>Devlin v. Galusha,
Higgins &amp; Galusha</u>.

<p>B

<p>Tooley also asserts N.D.C.C.  65-01-14 requires the bureau to notify him and others in the
proposed class of any "informal decision" they are not entitled to an impairment evaluation or
award.

<p>N.D.C.C.  65-01-14 governs the procedure when a claim or a reapplication for benefits is
made
under Title 65.  It authorizes the bureau to render an "informal decision on the claim after filing of
the claim and the physician's certificate" and requires the bureau to serve a "notice of decision" on
the parties.  N.D.C.C.  65-01-14(4).  If any party requests reconsideration of an informal decision,
the bureau must issue an order conforming to N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32, and thereafter any party may
request a rehearing or may appeal.  N.D.C.C.  65-01-14(5) also authorizes the bureau to hold
"informal proceedings to determine any matter subject to its jurisdiction" and requires the bureau
to give the parties a "notice of decision" and "notice of the right to request reconsideration."

<p>We are not persuaded the bureau holds "informal proceedings" requiring a "notice of
decision"
whenever a claimant's file is evaluated.  We construe statutes to avoid absurd and ludicrous
results.  <u>County of Stutsman v. State Historical Society</u>, 371 N.W.2d 321, 325 (N.D.
1985). 
N.D.C.C.  65-01-14 outlines the procedure "when a claim for benefits or reapplication for
benefits" is made under Title 65, and contemplates a "notice of decision" when a final
determination is made on a claim or on a reapplication.  We believe it would be absurd to require
the bureau to issue a "notice of decision" every time the bureau conducts any investigation or
review of a claimant's file.

<p>C

<p>A claimant's time for appeal does not begin to run until a notice of decision is given by the
bureau. 
N.D.C.C.  65-10-01; 28-32-15.  There is nothing in this record to indicate Tooley could not
request, or the bureau would not issue, an order delineating his rights so any impairment issues
raised by him in this case could be resolved in an appeal. <u> See</u> N.D.C.C.  28-32-19 (scope
of
review of agency decision).  Related issues have been successfully raised in appeals from decisions
of the bureau.2  <u>E.g.</u>, <u>Beckler v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau</u>,
418 N.W.2d 770,
775 (N.D. 1988) (bureau's pretermination procedure for terminating disability benefits deprived
claimant of due process).  Tooley's claims ignore the bureau's normal fact finding function and
procedure for appeals of decisions by the bureau, which provide him with an adequate legal
remedy.

<p>IV

<p>Tooley's right to appeal a bureau decision provides him with an adequate legal remedy which
he
has not exhausted, and he has not shown a clear legal right to have the bureau notify him of the
availability of impairment benefits, schedule an impairment evaluation, send him an impairment
form, or issue a notice of decision under N.D.C.C.  65-01-14.  He is therefore not entitled to
declaratory relief or a writ of mandamus.3

<p>The district court judgment dismissing Tooley's action is affirmed.

<p>2 N.D.C.C.  65-10-01 authorizes appeals from decisions of the bureau.  We have construed
those
provisions in harmony with the general provisions for appeals from decisions of administrative
agencies in N.D.C.C. 28-32-15.  <u>Westman v. North Dakota Workers Compensation
Bureau</u>, 459
N.W.2d 540 (N.D. 1990).

<p>3 Tooley also argues because there is no adequate procedure for certifying a class action at
the
administrative level, mandamus or declaratory relief is necessary to require the Bureau to address
the common questions of law and fact posed by him and others similarly situated.  However, he
cannot successfully argue mandamus or declaratory relief is justified to protect the rights of others
in his attempt to attain class action status, and he has presented no other persuasive reason to
justify a class action for his lawsuit.
