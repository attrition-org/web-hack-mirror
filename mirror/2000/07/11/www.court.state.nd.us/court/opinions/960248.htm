<p align="center"><strong>Disciplinary Board v. Leier</strong> 
<h5 align="center">Civil Nos. 960248-960257 &amp; 960390</h5>
<strong>Per Curiam</strong>.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  This is a disciplinary action against attorney Patrick F. Leier. 
In separate reports filed on
September 4, 1996 and December 18, 1996, under Rule 3.1(F), of the North Dakota Rules for
Lawyer Discipline, the Disciplinary Board found Leier committed numerous violations of the
North Dakota Code of Professional Responsibility and the North Dakota Rules of Professional
Conduct.<a name="FN_1_"><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The Board recommends to
the court Leier be
allowed to resign from the practice of
law for his misconduct, without possibility of reapplication for six years.  The Board also
recommends Leier be required to make restitution to specific complainants in the total amount of
$151,811.92 and pay costs of the disciplinary proceedings of $1,351.30.  Counsel for the
Disciplinary Board filed objections, under Rule 3.1(G), of the North Dakota Rules for Lawyer
Discipline, asserting disbarment, rather than resignation, is the appropriate sanction for Leier's
misconduct in this case.  <u>Compare</u> <u><a href="960297.htm">Matter of
Disciplinary Action Against Anseth</a></u>, 1997 ND__,
<a href="960297.htm#P16">&#182;16</a> (where Board dismissed disciplinary
action against attorney and did not file a report, the
Supreme Court exercised its inherent disciplinary power to review the Board's actions).  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  Leier signed stipulations on December 22, 1994 and
September 27, 1996, conceding he
committed the violations charged, agreeing to pay the recommended restitution and disciplinary
costs, and requesting he be allowed to resign from the practice of law, but consenting to accept
whatever discipline the court determines to be appropriate.  The December 22, 1994 stipulation
states, in part:          
  <blockquote>"If the resignation as a member of [the] Bar of the State of North Dakota is not
accepted,
Leier is agreeable to and will accept whatever penalty the Disciplinary Board and the
Supreme Court determine is appropriate in these proceedings. . . . [T]he request is that the
Supreme Court enter its order without need for further hearing."        
  </blockquote>

<p>In his appellate brief, Leier's counsel states:          
  <blockquote>"Leier acknowledges that the Court may impose whatever discipline it feels is
appropriate. 
Consequently, Leier has no intention of challenging any discipline that the Court may now
elect to impose in these proceedings, whether it be disbarment or resignation."          
  </blockquote>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  We review disciplinary proceedings against attorneys
<u>denovo</u> on the record under a clear
and convincing standard of proof. <u><a href="/court/opinions/940185.htm">Disciplinary Action
Against Rau</a></u>, 533 N.W.2d 691, 692 (N.D.
1995).  We accord due weight to the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the
Disciplinary Board; however, we do not act as a mere "rubber stamp" for those findings and
recommendations.  <a href="/court/opinions/950283.htm">Disciplinary Board v. Gray</a>, 544
N.W.2d 168, 171 (N.D. 1996).  Each
disciplinary case must be reviewed upon its own facts to determine what discipline is warranted. 
<u><a href="/court/opinions/950399.htm">Matter of Disciplinary Action Against
Nassif</a></u>, 547 N.W.2d 541, 542 (N.D. 1996).  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  Leier was admitted to practice in the courts of this state on
October 6, 1980.  In
representing clients between 1985 and 1993, Leier exhibited reprehensible conduct for a
practicing attorney.<a name="FN_2_"><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> In numerous
instances he failed to
diligently represent his clients' interests,
he mishandled client funds, and he lied to clients about the progress of their cases and the work he
had done on their behalf.  We need not detail the misconduct of the eleven separate disciplinary
files.  It is sufficient Leier concedes all charges of inappropriate conduct are true and concedes he
violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically, DR 1-102(A)(4) (conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and mispresentation); DR 6-101(A)(3) (neglect of entrusted legal
matters); DR 7-101(A) (failure to represent a client zealously); and DR 2-110; DR 5-102; DR
5-105 (prejudice and damage to a client during the course of professional relationship).   Leier
also concedes he violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically, Rule 1.1 (failure to
provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (failure to act with reasonable diligence and
promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (failure to reasonably inform and explain matters to
a client); Rule 1.5 (charging unreasonable fees and failing to reasonably communicate about fees
with the client); Rule 1.8(a) (engaging in transactions not fair and reasonable to the client or
without appropriate client notification and consent); Rule 1.15(c) (failing to keep lawyer and
client property separate during representation); Rule 4.1 (making false statements to a third
person in the course of representing a client); Rule 5.5 (unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.1
(knowingly making false statements or failing to disclose necessary facts about disciplinary
matters); and Rule 1.15 (failure to safeguard client funds or to maintain full records and render an
accounting to the client).  Leier further concedes his conduct violated the North Dakota
Procedural Rules for Lawyer Disability and Discipline, specifically, Rule 1.2(A)(3) and (8)
(conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation and conduct that is prejudicial
to the administration of justice) and Rule 6.3(A)(1) (failure to notify clients of suspension from
the practice of law).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  Leier admits his conduct, absent mitigating factors, warrants
disbarment from the practice of
law.  However, Leier asserts he suffered from mental illness, and in particular severe depression,
when his misconduct took place, and his illness was not diagnosed or treated until recently.  He
requests this court to consider his illness a mitigating factor and to accept his resignation instead
of disbarring him.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  We summarized the relevance of emotional problems and
mental disabilities as mitigating
factors in <u><a href="/court/opinions/940185.htm">Disciplinary Action Against Rau</a></u>,
533 N.W.2d at 694-695:          
  <blockquote>"Although personal or emotional problems and mental disabilities are mitigating
factors that
may reduce a disciplinary sanction against an attorney, they do not justify or excuse the
attorney's misconduct. . . . Nor do they shield the attorney from professional responsibility. .
. .   Rather, they are offered and considered merely as explanations of the lawyer's conduct
in order to temper the imposed sanction.        
  </blockquote>

<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *          <blockquote>"When an attorney seeks mitigation of
a sanction for professional misconduct by reason of
psychological disability, the attorney must at least demonstrate he had a severe
psychological or emotional problem and it was the cause of the misconduct. . . .  Rau
offered no expert testimony to show his mental illness either caused or contributed to his
breaches of professional conduct. . . .  Therefore, we can only speculate about the effect his
illness had on his actions, and we need more than speculation to mitigate his sanction for
professional misconduct."  (Citations omitted.)        
  </blockquote>

<p>Here, too, Leier has presented minimal evidence that his mental illness caused his professional
misconduct.  "Correlation is not synonymous with causation."  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/940185.htm">Disciplinary Action Against Rau</a></u>,
533 N.W.2d at 695.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  We have in limited instances accepted resignation of an
attorney in lieu of disbarment or
other disciplinary sanction.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u><em>, </em><u><a
href="/court/opinions/940308.htm">Disciplinary Action Against Kinsey</a></u>, 524 N.W.2d 89
(N.D.
1994); <u>Disciplinary Action Against Baird</u>, 496 N.W.2d 552 (N.D. 1993).  However, the
primary
purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/940185.htm">Disciplinary Action Against Rau</a></u>, 533
N.W.2d at 695; <u>Disciplinary Action Against Larson</u>, 485 N.W.2d 345 (N.D. 1992).  We
agree
with the Supreme Court of Minnesota that resignation is not an effective deterrent to future legal
misconduct.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Matter of Discipline of Peck</u>, 302 N.W.2d 356,
360 (Minn. 1981). 
Especially where there is a pattern of repeated conduct violations, as in this case, disbarment is
justified and necessary.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u><a
href="/court/opinions/940360.htm">Matter of Bailey</a></u>, 527 N.W.2d 274, 278 (N.D.
1995).  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  Having considered all factors presented in this record, we
conclude disbarment is the
appropriate sanction.  Accordingly, we order Patrick F. Leier be disbarred and his name removed
from the role of lawyers authorized to practice before this court.  We further order that Leier pay
restitution to wronged clients in accordance with the stipulations and that he pay the costs and
expenses of the disciplinary proceedings.    

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  Disbarred.
