<p align="center"><strong>Matter of Disciplinary Action Against Dvorak</strong> 
<h5 align="center">Civil No. 970341</h5>
<strong>Per Curiam.</strong> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  The Disciplinary Board petitions for reciprocal discipline
under North Dakota Rules for
Lawyer Discipline (NDRLD) 4.4, recommending discipline identical to that imposed by the
Minnesota Supreme Court be imposed on Shirley A. Dvorak.  <u>See</u> <u>In re Disciplinary
Action
Against Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d 399 (Minn. 1996).  We accept the Board's recommendation
and
impose the identical discipline.

<p align="center">I

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  Dvorak was admitted to practice law in North Dakota in
1976 and has spent her entire
professional career with the Moosbrugger, Dvorak &amp; Carter law firm in Grand Forks.  She
was
also admitted to practice in Minnesota in 1981 and in Florida in 1992.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  In 1995 the Director of the Minnesota Office of Lawyers
Professional Responsibility filed a
petition for public discipline against Dvorak alleging she improperly billed Minnesota clients in a
bankruptcy case.<a name="FN_1_"><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Following a hearing,
a referee concluded
fees Dvorak charged Alex and Edna
Wald for handling their bankruptcy violated Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC)
3.4(c) and 1.5(a).  The Minnesota Supreme Court explained the factual background:      
  <blockquote>The Walds hired Dvorak to represent them in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of their
farming
operation in May 1985.  The Walds orally agreed to pay Dvorak a retainer of $5,000 and
made an initial payment of $2,700 toward that retainer.  Their fee arrangement was outlined
in the required Statement Pursuant to Rule 2016(b) filed with the bankruptcy court.  On
February 26, 1987, Dvorak submitted an Application for Administrative Compensation
Allowance to the bankruptcy court seeking total compensation of $20,075.27, including
costs.  After a hearing, the court awarded the firm $10,000 in fees and $3,566.52 in costs,
for a total of $13,566.52.  Dvorak appealed the compensation award.      
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>The Walds subsequently voluntarily settled with their creditors.  Before the
bankruptcy was
officially dismissed by the court and while appeal of the fee award was pending, however,
Dvorak collected an additional $11,332.42 in fees from the Walds.  Along with other
interim payments, this brought the Walds' total fee payments to $19,647.42 and exceeded
the bankruptcy court's order by $6,080.90.  In 1992, after the Walds were contacted by an
Internal Revenue Service agent investigating the Moosbrugger firm, they sought, and
ultimately received, a refund from Dvorak and the firm in the amount of $6,080.90 in fees
and $3,949.34 in interest.      
  </blockquote>

<p><u>Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d at 401.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  Dvorak challenged the referee's conclusion that, in her billing
of the Walds, she knowingly
disobeyed a bankruptcy court order in violation of MRPC 3.4(c) and, in so doing, charged an
unreasonable fee in violation of MRPC 1.5(a).  The Minnesota Supreme Court, however, ruled
neither of the referee's conclusions were clearly erroneous.  <u>Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d at 403. 
In
imposing a sanction, the Court considered as mitigating factors Dvorak's settlement of the fee
dispute to the Walds' satisfaction before disciplinary proceedings were brought, Dvorak's lack of a
disciplinary record in Minnesota during 15 years of practice there, Dvorak's substantial personal
problems during the period in question, Dvorak's cooperation in the disciplinary investigation,
Dvorak's substantial contribution of pro bono and volunteer work to her community, and
Dvorak's outstanding reputation for honesty and hard work within the profession. 
<u>Dvorak</u>, 554
N.W.2d at 404.  The Court concluded "a 30-day suspension from the practice of law . . . is the
appropriate sanction on this record."  <u>Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d at 404-405.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  After the Disciplinary Board received a certified copy of the
Minnesota Supreme Court's
decision, the Board notified Dvorak of its intention to impose the identical discipline on her in
North Dakota.  Dvorak demanded a hearing, denied any wrongdoing, and asked this Court to
dismiss the matter.  On May 22, 1997, a hearing was held before three members of the Board. 
The hearing body recommended imposition of the identical discipline imposed by the Minnesota
Supreme Court.  The Board adopted the findings and recommendations of the hearing body,
concluding Dvorak should be suspended from the practice of law in North Dakota for 30 days and
pay $2,133.20 in costs and expenses incurred in these proceedings.  The Board submitted the
matter to this Court for consideration.

<p align="center">II

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  There are clear and specific disciplinary rules governing this
Court's duty when a lawyer,
who is admitted to practice in this state, has been disciplined in another jurisdiction.  NDRLD
4.4(D) provides:      
  <blockquote>D.  <u>Discipline.</u> . . . [T]he court shall impose the identical discipline unless
the lawyer
demonstrates and the court finds that upon the face of the record from which the discipline
is predicated, it clearly appears that:      
  <blockquote>(1)     The procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to
constitute a deprivation of due process; or                </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2)     There was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give
rise to the clear conviction that the court could not, consistent with its duty,
accept as final the conclusion on that subject; or                </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3)     The imposition of the same discipline by the court would result in grave
injustice; or                </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(4)     The misconduct established warrants substantially different discipline in
this state.            
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>If the court determines that any of those elements exists, the court shall enter such
other
order as it deems appropriate.  In all other aspects, a final determination in another
jurisdiction that a lawyer has been guilty of misconduct establishes conclusively the
misconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in this state.      
  </blockquote>

<p>A lawyer who has been disciplined in another jurisdiction has the burden to demonstrate that
identical, reciprocal discipline should not be imposed.  <u><a
href="/court/opinions/920215.htm">Disciplinary Action Against Lochow</a></u>, 502
N.W.2d 252, 253 (N.D. 1993).

<p align="center">A

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  Dvorak asserts the proceedings in Minnesota were so lacking
in adequate notice and a fair
opportunity to be heard that her due process rights were violated.  

<p align="center">1

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  Dvorak claims she was not given fair and adequate notice of
the charges concerning the
Wald bankruptcy fees.  Attorneys subjected to disciplinary proceedings are entitled to procedural
due process, including fair notice of the charges against them.  <u>See</u> <u><a
href="/court/opinions/920375.htm">Matter of Ellis</a></u>, 504 N.W.2d
559, 562 (N.D. 1993); <u>In re Eaton</u>, 60 N.D. 580, 235 N.W. 587, 592 (1931).  However,
on this
record, Dvorak has failed to establish a lack of fair notice of the charge against her.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  An original petition for disciplinary action concerning
Dvorak's filing of a false tax return
was instituted in May 1995.  Dvorak answered the petition in June 1995.  In late August 1995,
the Minnesota Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility asked Dvorak's counsel specific
questions concerning Dvorak's involvement with the Wald bankruptcy and requested documents
relating to Dvorak's representation.  Dvorak's counsel complied with the request, asking
disciplinary authorities to "review these enclosures, make whatever additional investigation you
deem necessary, and thereafter I am confident you will conclude that the Wald matter is not
anything upon which to base, at this extremely late date, a disciplinary proceeding against . . .
Dvorak."  In a September 14, 1995 letter, disciplinary authorities again requested answers to
"several specific questions" and requested several other documents not previously provided.  On
September 28, 1995, Dvorak's counsel complied with the request, arguing it was "grossly unfair
to . . . Dvorak to have her bear the brunt of a mammoth investigation undertaken by your office,"
and requested "after you have reviewed the enclosures, and have satisfied yourself that you have
learned as much as you care to concerning this Wald bankruptcy, that this investigation be
concluded and that we get on with the hearing based on the presently pending petition . . . ."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  An amended supplementary petition for disciplinary action
alleging unprofessional conduct
in regard to the Wald bankruptcy was served on Dvorak on November 8, 1995.  The hearing on
the amended supplemental petition was held on December 4 and 5, 1995.  The record of those
proceedings does not reflect Dvorak requested a continuance in order to have further time to
prepare to defend the charges concerning the Wald bankruptcy.  Rather, in defense of the
bankruptcy charge, Dvorak relied on the telephone deposition testimony of a local bankruptcy law
expert.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  Against this backdrop, Dvorak relies on the United States
Supreme Court's decision in <u>In
re Ruffalo</u>, 390 U.S. 544 (1968), to support her argument that she was denied due process. 
In
<u>Ruffalo</u>, a lawyer who handled Federal Employer's Liability Act (FELA) cases was
charged by the
bar association with a number of violations of the disciplinary rules, including his use of a
part-time employee to solicit FELA clients.  During the hearing, it was revealed that the part-time
employee was also employed by one of the railroads against which the lawyer had brought some
of his cases.  The bar association immediately added this charge against the lawyer in the midst of
the hearing and stated his employment of the part-time employee to investigate the employee's
employer "was deceptive in its nature and was morally and legally wrong . . . ."  <u>Ruffalo</u>,
390 U.S.
at 547.  The attorney was disbarred on this basis.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  The Supreme Court reversed the lawyer's subsequent
disbarment, as reciprocal discipline,
in federal court, because the lawyer had no notice that the employment of the part-time employee
would be considered a disbarment offense until after he had testified at length on all material facts
pertaining to that phase of the case.  The Court reasoned the disbarment proceedings were
"adversary proceedings of a quasi-criminal nature . . . [which] bec[a]me a trap when, after they
[were] underway, the charges [were] amended on the basis of testimony of the accused." 
<u>Ruffalo</u>,
390 U.S. at 551.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  The Supreme Court has since noted that, although the
majority in <u>Ruffalo</u> held a change in
the charges during the proceedings violated the lawyer's due process rights, the "particularly
offensive" feature of the case was "the change was such that the very evidence put on by the
[lawyer] in defense of the original charges became, under the revised charges, inculpatory." 
<u>Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel</u>, 471 U.S. 626, 655 n.18 (1985). <u>See</u>
<u>also</u> <u>Matter of
Smith</u>, 403 A.2d 296, 30 (D.C.Ct.App. 1979) (attorney in <u>Ruffalo</u> was not denied
due process
because bar association failed to give him timely notice of additional charge, but because bar
association failed to give him prior notice that his conduct was a disbarment offense, with the
consequence that lawyer was trapped into admitting he committed a disciplinary violation).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  The circumstances in this case are a far cry from those
present in <u>Ruffalo</u>.  <u>Ruffalo</u> involved
material facts provided through oral testimony at a hearing, while this case involves material facts
and documents provided in writing during the preliminary investigatory phase of the case.  We
have noted "[p]rocedural due process has modest application at the investigative stage." 
<u><a href="/court/opinions/940254.htm">Commission on Medical Competency v.
Racek</a></u>, 527 N.W.2d 262, 265 (N.D. 1995).  Moreover,
the correspondence between disciplinary counsel and Dvorak's counsel demonstrates Dvorak's
awareness of the possibility of additional disciplinary charges based on the Wald bankruptcy. 
Although a formal charge was brought only about one month before the hearing, Dvorak did not
ask for a continuance and presented expert evidence to support her position.  Dvorak has not
explained what more she would have done had she been given formal notice of the Wald
bankruptcy charge at an earlier date.  We conclude Dvorak was not denied adequate and fair
notice of the charges brought against her in the amended supplementary petition.

<p align="center">2

<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  Dvorak asserts she was denied due process because of the
different standard of review used
by the Minnesota Supreme Court in reviewing the findings of a disciplinary hearing body.  In
reviewing the findings of a referee in a disciplinary proceeding, the Minnesota Supreme Court
employs the "clearly erroneous" standard.  <u>See</u> <u>Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d at 403. 
This Court reviews
disciplinary proceedings against attorneys de novo on the record under a clear and convincing
standard of proof.  <u>See</u> <u><a href="/court/opinions/960391.htm">Matter of
Montgomery</a></u>, 1997 ND 148, <a href="/court/opinions/960391.htm#P5">&#182;5</a>,
566 N.W.2d 426.  Dvorak
asserts the Minnesota Supreme Court's use of the more deferential "clearly erroneous" standard,
rather than the de novo standard employed by this Court, denied her due process under North
Dakota law.  We disagree.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  Dvorak relies on numerous cases in which courts have
constitutionally mandated under the
due process clause minimum standards of proof in particular types of proceedings where
substantial rights are at stake.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Santosky v. Kramer</u>, 455 U.S.
745, 769 (1982) (due
process requires clear and convincing evidence standard of proof for parental rights terminations). 
However, an evidentiary standard of proof differs from a standard of review employed by an
appellate court to a decision in which the standard of proof has already been applied, and none of
the cases cited by Dvorak suggest there is a constitutionally mandated standard of review for an
appellate court.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  In C. Wolfram, <u>Modern Legal Ethics</u> &#167; 3.4
at p. 109 (1986), the author notes the standards
of proof in disciplinary proceedings vary, with some courts using the preponderance of the
evidence standard, others using the clear and convincing evidence standard, and others using the
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt standard.  Minnesota applies the clear and convincing
evidence standard in attorney disciplinary proceedings.  <u>See</u> <u>In re Disciplinary Action
Against
Randall</u>, 562 N.W.2d 679, 683 (Minn. 1997).  The author also observes the standards for
judicial
review vary, with some courts using the "any competent evidence" standard, others using the
substantial evidence standard, and others using the de novo standard.  C. Wolfram, &#167; 3.4 at
pp.
111-112.  Dvorak's failure to cite any case constitutionally mandating under the due process
clause a certain standard of review is probably attributable to the lack of any due process right to
appellate review.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  We have recognized that an appeal from a judgment, even
in a criminal case, is not a
necessary element of due process under the federal constitution.  <u>State v. Higgins</u>, 145
N.W.2d
478, 481 (N.D. 1966).  <u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>Johnson v. Fankell</u>, 117 S.Ct. 1800,
1807 n.13 (1997); <u>McKane
v. Durston</u>, 153 U.S. 684, 688 (1894).  Using this reasoning, courts have rejected any
suggestion
that due process requires that a court which makes final and binding factual determinations in a
disciplinary proceeding actually hear the witnesses' testimony.  <u>See</u> <u>Mildner v.
Gulotta</u>, 405
F.Supp. 182, 195 (E.D.N.Y. 1975), <u>aff'd</u> 406 U.S. 901 (1976) (Per Curiam); <u>Razatos
v. Colorado
Supreme Court</u>, 549 F.Supp. 798, 801 (D.Colo. 1982), <u>aff'd</u> 746 F.2d 1429 (10th
Cir. 1984), <u>cert.</u>
<u>denied</u>, 471 U.S. 1016 (1985).  If there is no due process right to appellate review, it is
difficult to
perceive how due process could nevertheless mandate any type of standard for appellate review. 
As the Supreme Court said in <u>Kohl v. Lehlback</u>, 160 U.S. 293, 299 (1895), "the right of
review in
an appellate court is purely a matter of state concern."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  While use of the "clearly erroneous" standard might place
an attorney at somewhat of a
disadvantage when attempting to overturn an adverse finding of a hearing body, Dvorak has not
convinced us that the use of the "clearly erroneous" standard by the Minnesota Supreme Court,
rather than the de novo standard used in this jurisdiction, amounts to a denial of her due process
rights.

<p align="center">B

<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  Dvorak asserts there was such an infirmity of proof in the
Minnesota proceedings
establishing the misconduct so as to give rise to the clear conviction that this Court cannot accept
as final the conclusions of the Minnesota Supreme Court.  Dvorak claims there was an infirmity of
proof that she knowingly disobeyed the bankruptcy court's order by collecting $6,080.90 in excess
fees from the Walds in violation of MRPC 3.4(c), <u>compare</u> NDRPC 3.4(c), and an
infirmity of
proof that the attorney fees collected from the Walds were unreasonable in violation of MRPC
1.5(a), <u>compare</u> NDRPC 1.5(a).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  Dvorak's argument on this issue is essentially an attempt to
retry the Minnesota disciplinary
proceedings.  However, to prevail in a reciprocal disciplinary proceeding, Dvorak must convince
us from the face of the record there was an infirmity of factual support for the disciplinary
authority's findings.  There is evidence in the record from which Minnesota disciplinary authorities
could find Dvorak knew of the bankruptcy court order and violated the order by charging the
Walds more than the bankruptcy court had awarded her as a fee.  Disciplinary authorities could
also find the fees were unreasonable.  The Minnesota Supreme Court dealt with her defenses and
explanations in its opinion, but simply rejected them.  We conclude there was no infirmity of proof
in the Minnesota proceedings to support imposition of discipline against Dvorak.

<p align="center">C

<p>[&#182;<a name="P22"></a>22]  Dvorak asserts the imposition of the same discipline by this
Court would result in grave
injustice because the Minnesota Supreme Court applies a different standard of review than does
this Court, there has been a 10-year delay between the conduct alleged and the proceedings here,
the imposition of identical discipline would not serve to protect the public at this late date, and the
imposition of a 30-day suspension in Minnesota was exacerbated by the multiple allegations of
misconduct.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P23"></a>23]  If we were to accept Dvorak's argument that use of the
clearly erroneous standard of
review by the Minnesota Supreme Court created a grave injustice, we would hold NDRLD 4.4 on
reciprocal discipline is inapplicable to discipline imposed on a lawyer by any court which does not
use, as does this Court, the de novo standard of reviewing the findings of a hearing body.  We
decline to do so.  Contrary to Dvorak's suggestion, there is nothing inherently evil or unjust about
appellate court review under the clearly erroneous standard.  Merely because the Minnesota
Supreme Court uses the more deferential clearly erroneous standard in reviewing the referee's
findings does not render imposition of reciprocal discipline gravely unjust.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P24"></a>24]  We are concerned about the 10-year delay between the
conduct alleged in the Wald
bankruptcy and commencement of this reciprocal disciplinary proceeding.  <u>See</u> Annot.,
<u>Attorneys
at Law: Delay in Prosecution of Disciplinary Proceeding as Defense or Mitigating
Circumstance</u>,
93 A.L.R.3d 1057 (1979); <u>In re Crum</u>, 55 N.D. 876, 215 N.W. 682, 688-689 (1927)
(reducing
sanction from disbarment to six-month suspension where offense occurred more than six years
before disciplinary action commenced).  However, it was apparently the investigation into the
charge of filing a false tax return that led Minnesota disciplinary authorities to investigate the
Wald bankruptcy matter.  Minnesota disciplinary authorities, as well as the Minnesota Supreme
Court, were aware of the already lengthy delay when the Minnesota proceedings were
commenced.  Further delay in these proceedings were caused by Dvorak's request for a hearing on
the petition for reciprocal discipline.  Nevertheless, the misconduct was serious.  Under these
circumstances, we cannot say the delay in commencing the reciprocal disciplinary proceeding
results in a grave injustice or that the purpose of protecting the public would not be served by
imposing identical discipline on Dvorak.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P25"></a>25]  Dvorak's claim that the discipline imposed by the
Minnesota Supreme Court was
exacerbated by its consideration of the Wald bankruptcy and the tax matter together is without
merit.  Although both the tax matter and the Wald bankruptcy were considered in the Minnesota
Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the Court imposed a public reprimand for the tax return
violation and imposed the 30-day suspension for the misconduct involving the Wald bankruptcy. 
<u>See</u> <u>Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d at 404-405.  The Court did not consider the tax
matter and the Wald
bankruptcy together in imposing the 30-day suspension.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P26"></a>26]  Dvorak asserts the misconduct established in the
Minnesota proceedings warrants
substantially different discipline in this state.  Dvorak relies on other cases in this jurisdiction
involving a single charge of misconduct in collecting fees in violation of NDRPC 1.5, where only
probation, an admonition, or a public reprimand has been given as a sanction.  However, while we
attempt to impose similar disciplinary measures for similar violations under similar circumstances,
we have also recognized that each disciplinary case must be decided on its own particular facts. 
<u>See</u> <u><a href="/court/opinions/950406.htm">Disciplinary Action Against
LaQua</a></u>, 548 N.W.2d 372, 373 (N.D. 1996).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P27"></a>27]  Under North Dakota Standards For Imposing Lawyer
Sanctions (NDSILS) 6.22,
"[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows that he or she is violating a court
order . . . and causes injury or potential injury to a client . . . ."  Suspension is also "generally
appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the
profession and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system." 
NDSILS 7.2.  The discipline imposed by the Minnesota Supreme Court is within the realm of that
which could have been imposed under NDSILS.  <u>See</u> <a
href="/court/opinions/920215.htm">Lochow</a>, 502 N.W.2d at 254.  Dvorak's
misconduct does not warrant substantially different discipline in this state. 

<p align="center"><u>E</u> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P28"></a>28]  Dvorak asserts the Board failed to consider mitigating
circumstances in imposing discipline
identical to that imposed by the Minnesota Supreme Court.  Only new mitigating circumstances
not taken into consideration by the foreign jurisdiction may warrant different discipline in this
state.  <u>See</u> <u><a href="/court/opinions/920215.htm">Lochow</a></u>, 502 N.W.2d at
255.  Most of the "new" mitigating circumstances were either
expressly considered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in its decision, or are merely slight
variations of circumstances presented to that Court, and we deem them to have been considered
in the foreign proceedings.  The only "new" mitigating circumstances occurring after discipline
was imposed in Minnesota are the devastating effect the 1997 flood in Grand Forks had on
Dvorak's law firm and law practice, and personal problems resulting from a May 1997 divorce
from her husband of 10 years.  While we sympathize with Dvorak over her personal problems,
and with the residents of Grand Forks who have had to deal with the flood and its aftermath, we
are not persuaded these circumstances warrant discipline different than that imposed by the
Minnesota Supreme Court.

<p align="center">III

<p>[&#182;<a name="P29"></a>29]  We order that Dvorak be suspended from the practice of
law in North Dakota for a period
of 30 days, effective August 8, 1998, and that she pay $2,133.20 in costs and expenses incurred in
these proceedings.<br>

<strong>Footnote:</strong> <a name="N_1_"></a><a href="#FN_1_"> 

<p>1. </a>Originally, the petition sought discipline for Dvorak's conduct leading to her plea of
guilty in
federal court in North Dakota to a misdemeanor count of filing a false tax return.  This petition
was later amended to also seek discipline for Dvorak's billings in the bankruptcy case.  The
Minnesota Supreme Court, as we had previously done, issued Dvorak a public reprimand for
filing the false tax return.  <u>See</u> <u>Dvorak</u>, 554 N.W.2d at 404.  The present
disciplinary action
focuses solely on Dvorak's actions involving the bankruptcy proceedings.
