<p align="center"><strong>Matter of Application for Disciplinary Action Against </strong> 

<p align="center"><strong>Shirley A. Dvorak</a></strong> 

<h5 align="center">No. <a name="6">990384</a></h5> 

<p><strong>Per Curiam.</strong> 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  Disciplinary Counsel objects to the Disciplinary Board's
dismissal of a formal complaint
against Shirley A. Dvorak.  We reverse the decision of the Disciplinary Board.  Exercising our
inherent power to discipline lawyers, we suspend Dvorak from the practice of law for a period of
one year.

<p align="center">I.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  In 1997 and 1998, Dvorak represented Weston Berg in a
divorce action against his wife,
Brenda Berg, part of which involved an extensive and bitter child custody dispute.  The trial court
appointed a guardian ad litem, Carma Christensen, who then asked each of the parties for the
names of persons who could provide helpful information about the children's circumstances. 
Brenda gave Christensen the name of her cousin, Deb Jacobs.  Christensen sent Jacobs a
questionnaire, to which Jacobs responded, using her computer at work to type her responses. 
Dvorak obtained a copy of Jacobs' responses to the questionnaire and, when Dvorak deposed
Jacobs on February 5, 1998, she asked Jacobs numerous questions pertaining to the responses. 
During the deposition, it became clear some of Jacobs' answers were not based on personal
knowledge, but on statements Brenda made to her in the past.  Further, some of the information
in Jacobs' responses was inaccurate.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  On February 28, 1998, Dvorak sent Jacobs a letter in which
she claimed Jacobs had
defamed Weston by making false and malicious statements.  The letter was sent "PURSUANT
TO NDCC 32-43-01 THROUGH 10," which contain the legal requirements for maintaining a
defamation action in this state.  Dvorak attached a copy of Jacobs' responses to the questionnaire,
on which she had redacted statements "acceptable" to Weston, and indicated all other statements
were to be corrected. Dvorak further stated, if Jacobs failed to correct those statements, Weston
would "pursue all remedies available to him."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  On March 12, 1998, Dvorak sent a letter to Jacobs'
employer, the North Dakota
Department of Human Services ("DHS").  In that letter, Dvorak stated Jacobs had stored
documents relevant to the Berg divorce action on her computer at work and that she wished to
secure all writings relevant to the pending case.  Further, Dvorak stated Jacobs had admitted in
her deposition that the information contained in these documents was "untrue."  In another
sentence, Dvorak again referred to the materials as "untrue documents."

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  Jacobs, with the help of an attorney she contacted after
receiving Dvorak's letter, filed a
complaint with the Disciplinary Board.  A hearing was held on June 29, 1999, at which
Disciplinary Counsel contended Dvorak's letter to Jacobs violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 3.4 and
that her letter to DHS violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct 4.4.  The hearing body determined the
violations had not been proven by clear and convincing evidence and recommended the petition
for discipline be dismissed.  The Disciplinary Board adopted the hearing body's recommendation
on November 22, 1999.

<p align="center">II.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  As an initial matter, Dvorak notes that the Disciplinary Board
filed no report of its
findings and recommendations under N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl. 3.1(G) (1999).  Dvorak contends, in
the absence of such a report, this Court's jurisdiction was not invoked by Disciplinary Counsel's
objection to the Disciplinary Board's dismissal of the petition for discipline.  We need not address
her argument because we conclude this case calls for the exercise of our inherent disciplinary
power.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  We have recognized that our Court has a "duty to maintain
the integrity of the legal
profession by disciplining lawyers." <a href="960297.htm">Matter of Disciplinary
Action Against Anseth</a></u>, 1997 ND 66,
<a href="960297.htm#P18">&#182;&nbsp;18</a>, 562 N.W.2d 385.  Thus, we
have reserved authority under N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl.
3.1(H) (1999) to institute disciplinary proceedings on our own initiative.  We conclude the
circumstances presented by this case are serious enough to warrant the exercise of this inherent
authority.<a name="FN_1_"><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 

<p align="center">III.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  On appeal, this Court reviews disciplinary proceedings de
novo on the record. 
<u><a href="960248.htm">Disciplinary Bd. v. Leier</a></u>, 1997 ND 79, <a
href="960248.htm#P3">&#182;&nbsp;3</a>, 562 N.W.2d 741.  Disciplinary
counsel must
prove each alleged violation of the disciplinary rules by clear and convincing evidence. 
<u><a href="980378.htm">Disciplinary Bd. v. Dooley</a></u>, 1999 ND 184,
<a href="980378.htm#P28">&#182;&nbsp;28</a>, 599 N.W.2d 619.  We
consider each
disciplinary case upon its own facts to decide what discipline is warranted. <u><a
href="960248.htm">Leier</a></u>, at <a
href="960248.htm#P3">&#182;&nbsp;3</a>.

<p align="center">A.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  Disciplinary Counsel contends Dvorak's letter to Jacobs
violated N.D.R. Prof. Conduct
3.4(a), in that it was an attempt to "unlawfully obstruct another party's access to evidence."  He
asserts Jacobs' responses to Christensen's questionnaire were privileged, and so could not have
served as the basis for a defamation suit.  Thus, he argues Dvorak's threat was an unlawful
attempt to intimidate Jacobs into changing her responses.  We agree.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  There can be no liability for defamatory statements that are
privileged.  <u>Soentgen v.
Quain &amp; Ramstad Clinic, P.C.</u>, 467 N.W.2d 73, 78 (N.D. 1991).  "Privilege is based on
the sound
public policy that some communications are so socially important that the full and unrestricted
exchange of information requires some latitude for mistake."  <u>Id.</u>  Under N.D.C.C.
&#167;
14-02-05(2), a communication is privileged when it is made "[i]n any legislative or judicial
proceeding or in any other proceeding authorized by law."  Such a statement is protected by
absolute privilege; thus, even if the statement was made with actual malice, the speaker is
protected from liability.  <u><a href="930102.htm">Rykowsky v. Dickinson Pub.
Sch. Dist. No. 1</a></u>, 508 N.W.2d 348, 351
(N.D. 1993).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  Answers given in response to a guardian ad litem's
questionnaire are statements made
in a judicial proceeding.  Guardian ad litem appointments and custodial investigations and reports
are initiated by court order.  <u>See</u> N.D.C.C. &#167;&#167;&nbsp;14-09-06.4 and
14-09-06.3.  Under
N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-09-06.3(2), a guardian ad litem investigating a child's circumstances "may
consult any person who may have information about the child. . . ."  Even after a guardian ad
litem completes her report and presents it to the trial court, she may be called as a witness and
cross-examined regarding her findings and recommendation.  N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-09-06.3(3);
<a href="980321.htm">Green v. Green</a></u>, 1999 ND 86, <a
href="980321.htm#P9">&#182;&nbsp;9</a>, 593 N.W.2d 398.  Thus,
Christensen performed her duties
as a guardian ad litem under the authority of the judicial system, and responses to her
questionnaire were protected by absolute privilege.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  If "all persons are presumed to know the law," <u><a
href="930358.htm">Tooley v. Alm</a></u>, 515 N.W.2d 137, 141
(N.D. 1994), then certainly Dvorak, as a seasoned attorney, knew or should have known of the
legal principles explained above.  Despite that, Dvorak sent a letter to Jacobs threatening a
defamation lawsuit based on privileged communications.  Under N.D.C.C.
&#167;&nbsp;32-43-03(1),
Dvorak's letter was a predicate requirement to maintaining that action; it served no other purpose.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  Dvorak argues her conduct did not violate Rule 3.4
because it did not obstruct
Brenda's access to Jacobs as a witness; Brenda was still free to call Jacobs at trial.  Dvorak
misunderstands the rule.  A lawyer violates Rule 3.4 not only when she denies access to a witness
completely, but also when she unlawfully attempts to dissuade a witness from providing particular
information to the court.  Dvorak's letter requesting that Jacobs "correct" her privileged
statements was just such an attempt.  Jacobs testified at the disciplinary hearing that when she
received the letter she feared she would be sued and her first thought was to protect herself and
her family.  Initially, Jacobs believed she should change the answers she provided on the
questionnaire.  Jacobs retained an attorney, who advised her not to change her responses, but to
file a disciplinary complaint instead.  It is irrelevant that Dvorak's attempt to intimidate Jacobs into
changing her responses failed; the attempt itself violated the rule.  We find Disciplinary Counsel
has proven by clear and convincing evidence that Dvorak violated Rule 3.4 when she threatened
Jacobs with a defamation action based on Jacobs' privileged statements.

<p align="center">B.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  Disciplinary Counsel next argues Dvorak's letter to Jacobs'
employer  violated N.D.R.
Prof. Conduct 4.4.  The hearing body found Disciplinary Counsel had not proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the letter had no purpose other than Jacobs' embarrassment.  We agree
that the letter served a purpose other than to embarrass Jacobs.  Dvorak's letter sought
preservation of any documents relevant to the divorce and also requested that these documents be
removed from the public domain, both of which are legitimate purposes.  However, we conclude
Dvorak's statement to Jacobs' employer that Jacobs admitted she provided false information was a
separate and independent act which violated Rule 4.4.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P15"></a>15]  Rule 4.4 states that a "lawyer shall not use means that have
no substantial purpose
other than to embarrass or burden a third person . . . ."  The comment to that rule states:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>[r]esponsibility to a client requires a lawyer to subordinate the
interests of
others to those of the client, but that responsibility does not imply that a lawyer has no obligation
to respect the rights of third persons. . . . [A] lawyer shall not . . . act on a client's behalf only to
harass or maliciously injure another. . . .</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P16"></a>16]  Blaine Nordwall, the director of DHS's Legal Advisory
Unit, testified in a deposition
which was admitted as an exhibit at the disciplinary hearing, that Dvorak's characterization of the
documents as untrue made no difference in the manner in which the documents were handled
following her request that they be preserved.  Thus, Dvorak's statement did not serve the
legitimate purposes of her letter.  We conclude no substantial purpose existed for telling Jacobs'
employer that Jacobs admitted making untrue statements other than to embarrass or burden
Jacobs.  Therefore, we find Disciplinary Counsel has proven by clear and convincing evidence that
Dvorak violated Rule 4.4.

<p align="center">IV.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P17"></a>17]  In determining the appropriate sanction for a lawyer's
misconduct, we consider:  (1) the
duty violated; (2) the lawyer's mental state; (3) the potential or actual injury caused by the
lawyer's misconduct; and (4) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  N.D. Stds.
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 3.0.  We conclude Dvorak's letter threatening Jacobs with a
defamation action interfered with the administration of justice and, therefore, violated her duties
to the legal system, implicating Standard 6.0, N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.  In addition,
we conclude her statement to Jacobs' employer that Jacobs admitted providing untrue information
violated Dvorak's duties to the public, implicating Standard 5.0, N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer
Sanctions.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P18"></a>18]  According to our standards, the possible sanctions for
Dvorak's misconduct are:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>Standard 5.0 Violations of Duties Owed to
the Public</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>5.1 Failure to Maintain Personal Integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>5.11 Disbarment is generally appropriate
when:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a lawyer engages in serious conduct a necessary element of

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>5.14 Admonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in
any other

<p align="center">. . . .

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>Standard 6.0 Violations of Duties Owed to
the Legal
System</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>6.1 False Statements, Fraud, and Misrepresentation.  Absent
aggravating or
mitigating circumstances, upon application of the factors set out in Standard 3.0, the following
sanctions are generally appropriate in cases involving conduct that is prejudicial to the
administration of justice or that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation to a
court:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>6.11 Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer, with the
intent to
deceive the court, makes a false statement, submits a false document, or improperly withholds
material information, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a party, or causes a
significant or potentially significant adverse effect on the legal
proceeding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>6.12 Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows that
false
statements or documents are being submitted to the court or that material information is
improperly being withheld, and takes no remedial action, and causes injury or potential injury to a
party to the legal proceeding, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal
proceeding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>6.13 Reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent
either in
determining whether statements or documents are false or in taking remedial action when material
information is being withheld, and causes injury or potential injury to a party to the legal
proceeding, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal
proceeding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>6.14 Admonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in
an
isolated instance of neglect in determining whether submitted statements or documents are false
or in failing to disclose material information upon learning of its falsity, and causes little or no
actual or potential injury to a party, or causes little or no adverse or potentially adverse effect on
the legal proceeding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>In general, disbarment and suspension are appropriate sanctions for intentional or  knowing
misconduct.  <u><a href="960297.htm">Anseth</a></u>, 1997 ND 66, <a
href="960297.htm#P29">&#182;&nbsp;29</a>, 562 N.W.2d 385.  We find
Dvorak's misconduct in
this case was knowing.  Her letter to Jacobs conditioned the threat of a lawsuit on Jacobs'
correction of her responses to Christensen's questionnaire, which was a conscious attempt to bully
Jacobs into changing her responses.  Dvorak knew or should have known Jacobs' responses were
privileged communications.  Similarly, Dvorak knew or should have known the veracity of the
information stored on Jacobs' computer at DHS would have no bearing on the treatment of her
request that the documents be preserved.  We find Dvorak's statements were intended only to
embarrass Jacobs in her workplace.</u>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P19"></a>19]  Next, we consider the potential or actual injury caused
by Dvorak's misconduct. 
Though Dvorak's attempt to dissuade Jacobs from providing information to the guardian ad litem
failed, the actual harm her letter caused was not insubstantial.  Jacobs testified Dvorak's threat of
a lawsuit frightened her and that she retained an attorney to defend her, at her personal expense. 
The potential harm of Dvorak's misconduct is also of great concern to this Court.  Our system of
justice relies heavily on the willingness of our citizens to provide information; Dvorak's threat of a
defamation action and her attempt to embarrass Jacobs are behaviors which erode the public's
trust in our legal system, discourage citizens from coming forward, and prejudice the
administration of justice.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P20"></a>20]  Finally, we consider relevant the existence of several
aggravating factors, which we
may consider in deciding the proper sanction for attorney misconduct and  which may justify an
increase in the degree of discipline we impose.  N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 9.1, 9.21. 
Among these factors are Dvorak's substantial experience in the practice of law, her refusal to
acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct, and that, in this instance, she has committed
multiple offenses.  <u>See</u> N.D. Stds. Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 9.22(i), (g) and (d).  We
find an
additional aggravating factor, Dvorak's prior disciplinary record, of great concern.  N.D. Stds.
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 9.22(a).  Dvorak has been disciplined in four previous instances.  She
was reprimanded in 1989 and 1995, and was admonished in 1997.  Further, Dvorak was
suspended from the practice of law for 30 days in 1998, upon an application for reciprocal
discipline following her suspension from the practice of law in Minnesota.  <u>See</u> <u><a
href="970341.htm">Disciplinary Board
v. Dvorak</a></u>, 1998 ND 134, 580 N.W.2d 586; <u>In re Disciplinary Action Against
Dvorak</u>, 554
N.W.2d 399 (Minn. 1996).

<p>[&#182;<a name="P21"></a>21]  We conclude Dvorak's misconduct warrants a suspension
from the practice of law for a
period of one year, commencing June 30, 2000.  We recognize the length of the suspension is
grave punishment; however, this Court's disciplinary orders are not "empty noise," but are
intended to protect the public.  <u><a href="930219.htm">Disciplinary Bd. v.
Larson</a></u>, 512 N.W.2d 454, 457 (N.D. 1994). 
We conclude a lengthy suspension is necessary under the circumstances.  This case marks
Dvorak's fourth disciplinary sanction in five years.  Less than two years ago, we imposed a 30-day
suspension upon Dvorak.  Before she may practice law again, Dvorak must apply for
reinstatement in accordance with N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl. 4.5.  In addition, in order to be
reinstated she must show successful completion of the Multistate Professional Responsibility 
Examination.

<a href="990359.htm#P41">&#182; 41</a>. Finally, we direct that Dvorak pay
the
costs of this disciplinary proceeding to be determined by the Disciplinary Board.  <u>See</u>
