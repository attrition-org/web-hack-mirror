<h5 align="center">No. <a name="6">980321</a></h5>

<p>  <strong>VandeWalle, Chief Justice.</strong>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P1"></a>1]  Michelle Green appealed from a divorce judgment, claiming
the trial court
erred in awarding custody of the parties' minor children to their father, Edward
Green.  She also claims the court erred in not awarding her spousal support or
attorney fees.  We hold the trial court committed reversible error when it relied on
facts contained in the guardian ad litem's investigative report, which was submitted
after the evidentiary hearing, without giving the parties an opportunity to cross-examine the
guardian ad litem or persons interviewed by him.  We further hold
Michelle waived the issue of spousal support and the trial court did not abuse its
discretion in refusing to award either party attorney fees.  We affirm in part, reverse
in part, and remand for further proceedings.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P2"></a>2]  Michelle and Edward Green were married in 1986.  They
have two sons age
9 and age 7.  In 1996, Michelle filed for a divorce from Edward, alleging
irreconcilable differences in the marriage, and requesting custody of the boys.  After
an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted Michelle a divorce but awarded custody
of the children to Edward, with reasonable visitation for Michelle.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P3"></a>3]  Michelle asserts the trial court erred in awarding custody to
Edward by
relying on facts contained in the guardian ad litem's report, without giving Michelle
an opportunity to cross-examine the guardian ad litem or persons interviewed by him. 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P4"></a>4]  At the close of the evidentiary hearing, the trial court
explained it
was going
to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the children's interests:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  Based on the evidence I've heard in the last two
and a half days counsel, I've decided that I'm going to issue an order
appointing a guardian ad litem with regard to the children.  The reason
for that is, and don't take my comments to mean that I've made any
conclusions at this point, but there is evidence in the record from which
I could possibly determine that domestic violence was perpetrated
actually by both parties, depending on how I would look at the
evidence.  There's also evidence in the record of substance abuse,
probably more evidence with regard to Ms. Green's substance abuse
and possible issues regarding her responsibility.  I guess to be very
honest, in these cases normally by the completion of evidence, I have
I guess what would be called a more or less preliminary or gut feeling
as to what I'm going to do.  Based on what I've heard, I don't.  I'm at
a loss, so I think that I need an independent report. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>The trial court entered an order appointing a guardian ad litem:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  The guardian ad litem is appointed with authority
to protect and foster the best interests of the children and obtain
information from whatever sources he deems necessary so that he may
represent the best interest of the children.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>  The guardian ad litem shall file a report regarding
custody and visitation and other matters relating to the children as soon
as possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>The guardian ad litem gathered information and interviewed numerous persons.  He
then filed a report  recommending the court award custody of the children to Edward. 

<p>[&#182;<a name="P5"></a>5]  On April 1, 1998 the trial court issued findings of fact,
conclusions of law,
and order for judgment, explaining why the court had decided to award custody to
Michelle:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>  There is credible evidence of domestic violence
perpetrated on Michelle by Edward . . . .  The rebuttable presumption
that Edward may not be awarded sole or joint custody is created here. 
There is no evidence that Edward is rehabilitated or has in any way
addressed the issues involving domestic violence.  In fact, Edward
denies the incidents happened the way Michelle described them.  There
is not clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the
children require Edward's participation as a custodial
parent.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>. . . .</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>  Michelle is awarded sole custody of the children. 
I am unable to find evidence to rebut the presumption of &#167; 14-09-06.2(1)(j), N.D.C.C. 
Section 14-09-06.2(1)(k), N.D.C.C. creates no
presumption, but does require me to consider the presence of other
persons in a parents life in determining the best interests and welfare
of the children.  Mr. Marti's presence disturbs me greatly.<a name="FN_1_"><a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
The only
reason I am not more concerned is there is no evidence Mr. Marti has
ever harmed a child.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>(Footnote added.)

<p>[&#182;<a name="P6"></a>6]  Edward filed a motion requesting reconsideration by the
court.  The court
treated the motion as a request for relief from the judgment under<a
href="/court/rules/civil/Rule60.htm"> N.D.R.Civ.P. 60</a>(b),
and in an order, dated April 20, 1998, the court explained it had made a mistake and
had decided to award custody to Edward:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>I agree that the statement in the guardian ad litem's
report that Mr. Marti twisted Kyle's arm should have been given much
more weight.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>. . . .</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>  I am convinced I made a mistake in applying the
evidence.  I believe that I let my personal feelings about Edward decide
this case rather than the facts and the law.  The clear and convincing
evidence is that best interests of the children require Edward's
participation as a  custodial parent. . . .  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>. . . .  There is evidence of physical abuse of Kyle
by Mr. Marti.  While this may have been an isolated incident, I am
unwilling to take the chance that Mr. Marti has simply been on his
good behavior while this case is pending.  I will not take chances with
the physical or emotional health of a child.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>[&#182;<a name="P7"></a>7]  Evidence of domestic violence creates a presumption against
awarding
custody to the perpetrator of the domestic violence, which can be rebutted only by
clear and convincing evidence.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/960218.htm">Huesers v.
Huesers</a></u>, 1997 ND 33, <a href="/court/opinions/960218.htm#P7">&#182; 7</a>, 560
N.W.2d 219.  The trial court initially found Edward committed domestic violence
during the marriage, the presumption against awarding custody to Edward was
applicable, and there was not clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption. 
In granting Edward's request for reconsideration, the trial court found there was clear
and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption and to require that, in the children's
best interests, Edward become the custodial parent.  Michelle filed a motion for
amendment of judgment under <a href="/court/rules/civil/Rule59.htm">N.D.R.Civ.P. 59</a>(j),
or, alternatively, for a new trial
under <a href="/Court/rules/civil/Rule59.htm">N.D.R.Civ.P. 59</a>(a).  The trial court denied
the motion, and on July 24, 1998
judgment was entered awarding custody to Edward.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P8"></a>8]  We take no issue with the authority of the trial court to
change its position. 
When the trial court believes the change is warranted, we respect the trial court for
its courage in admitting an error was made.  But, we do find fault with the procedure
used to arrive at that change of position in this case.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P9"></a>9]  The trial court, in its discretion, under N.D.C.C. &#167;
14-09-06.4, may
appoint a guardian ad litem to serve as an advocate of the children's best interests in
a divorce action.  <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u><a href="/court/opinions/970298.htm">Harty v.
Harty</a></u>, 1998 ND 99, <a href="/court/opinions/970298.htm#P4">&#182; 4</a>, 578
N.W.2d 519. 
The court, in its discretion, under N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-09-06.3, may also order an
investigation and report concerning custodial arrangements and designate the person
to make the investigation.  All data and reports relied upon by the investigator must
be made available to the parties, and they must be given the opportunity to cross-examine the
investigator and any person whom the investigator has consulted:

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>The court shall mail the investigator's report to
counsel and to any party not represented by counsel at least thirty days
before the hearing.  The investigator shall make available to any such
counsel or party the complete file of data and reports underlying the
investigator's report and the names and addresses of all persons whom
the investigator has consulted.  A party may call the investigator and
any person whom the investigator has consulted for cross-examination
at the hearing.  A party may not waive the party's right of cross-examination before the
hearing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-09-06.3(3).  When, as here, a guardian ad litem, after gathering
information and interviewing persons, files a recommendation and report which in
effect is an investigative report, N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-09-06.3(3) applies, and the parties
have a right to call the guardian ad litem as a witness and to cross-examine the
guardian ad litem with leading questions.  <u>See</u> <u><a
href="/court/opinions/940094.htm">Alvarez v. Carlson</a></u>, 524 N.W.2d 584,
588 (N.D. 1994).<a name="FN_2_"><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Under the clear
language of the statute,
the parties also have the
right to call and cross-examine persons consulted by the guardian ad litem while
acting as an investigator.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P10"></a>10]  In granting Edward's motion for reconsideration, the trial
court relied on
statements in the guardian ad litem's report about Michelle's boyfriend abusing one
of the children.  In relying on this information, the court  treated the guardian ad litem
as an investigator, and, therefore, the procedural rights provided under N.D.C.C. &#167;
14-09-06.3 apply.  Because the guardian ad litem was appointed after the close of the
evidentiary proceedings, his report was not introduced into evidence and neither party
was given an opportunity to call or cross-examine him or persons he contacted.  One
of the fundamental precepts of our judicial system is that the finder of fact must rely
only on the evidence presented in court.  <u><a href="/court/opinions/940204.htm">McAdams v.
McAdams</a></u>, 530 N.W.2d 647,
651 (N.D. 1995).  We hold the trial court committed reversible error when it relied
on evidentiary facts in the guardian ad litem's report for purposes of making its
custody decision, without allowing the parties an opportunity to call and cross-examine the
guardian ad litem or persons contacted by him.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P11"></a>11]  Michelle complains the trial court did not award spousal
support.  She 
concedes, however, she did not request spousal support and did not otherwise raise
this issue before the trial court.  We have repeatedly held that issues not raised in the
trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.  <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u><a
href="/court/opinions/970046.htm">Cermak v. Cermak</a></u>,
1997 ND 187, <a href="/court/opinions/970046.htm#P15">&#182; 15</a>, 569 N.W.2d 280. 
We conclude Michelle has waived this
issue for purposes of this appeal.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P12"></a>12]  Michelle also asserts the trial court erred in not awarding
her attorney fees. 
The trial court has discretion, under N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-05-23, to award attorney fees
in divorce proceedings.  We will not disturb the trial court's decision regarding
attorney fees unless the complaining party affirmatively establishes the court abused
its discretion.<a href="/court/opinions/970131.htm">  <u>Hogue v. Hogue</a></u>, 1998 ND
26, <a href="/court/opinions/970131.htm#P29">&#182; 29</a>, 574 N.W.2d 579.  Michelle's
counsel has not demonstrated how the trial court abused its discretion in not awarding
either party attorney fees in this case.  

<p>[&#182;<a name="P13"></a>13]  We affirm the trial court's decision not awarding spousal
support or
attorney fees to either party, but we reverse the custody decision and remand for
evidentiary proceedings and a redetermination of custody and, if necessary, child
support.

<p>[&#182;<a name="P14"></a>14]  Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
