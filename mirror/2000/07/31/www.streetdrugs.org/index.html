Well, that applieshere. Even the best security in the world can be circumvented by poorly written Perl scripts. Hint: `cat  | cut -f1 d:` is pretty dangerous on unchecked input!<br><br>More to the point, Mr Admin, check out your /cgi-bin/usermaint.pl script. It passes unchecked input to shell-scripts which also don't do any checking. <b>This applies to every site hosted on your server - even those mounted across your NFS link.</b> I only hacked this one because it was the first I came to.<br><Br> </td></table></body></html>
