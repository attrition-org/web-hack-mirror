                    Shortly after being spammed from the same fucking system I was last time. For those who didn't see my last little note, I was pissed off after recieving a pile of junk mail sent from highway235.com's inept management, who quite obviously wouldn't know responsible online marketing if it bit them in the arse.

                <p>
                    I recieved <a href="spamold.txt">this spam</a> for dodgy aphrodisiacs the other day, and left a <a href="oldsite/">nice note</a> to the site's owners about responsible online marketing practices. Now I recieve <a href="spam.txt">more spam</a> from them? WTF. Damn spammers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So here I am again.

                    I'm Vortex, a minor who is not interested in <a href="spamold.txt">making the little guy stand to attention</a> with dodgy pills, nor am I interested in being <a href="spam.txt">told which penny shares to buy</a>. I don't have a credit card, I'm not old enough to buy half this crap, and it's irrelevant to me as I'd trade stocks and shares in my home country if I was going to do it at all.
                </p>

                <a name="how"><h4>How</h4></a>
                <p>
                    Last time it was through the BIND &lt; 8.2.2-P5 buffer overflow exploit (detailed at <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-14-bind.html">CERT</a>), which I patched after exploiting, upgrading their nameservers to a secure release. The admin was informed of the remaining ways I had to access the system, and I requested that they refrain from using bulk mail to market their products. This time, I noticed my backdoor was still in place (!!).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Again, I haven't damaged anything (despite making threats about &quot;if it happened again...&quot;, I'm not going to <tt>rm -rf</tt> anything because that would make me worse than the spammers. Plus, I don't think the system admin is such a bad guy, he appears not to have any part in the spamming. Personally I reckon he should find a job at a company with ethics...)
                </p>

                <p>
                    OK admin guy, here's how to close my holes (Oooh yeah baby! ;) ). Look in <tt>/tmp/.b/</tt>, these are your original binaries (ps, netstat, etc). Copy them over the ones reported by <tt>which [binary]</tt>, as the ones in place are trojaned to hide my bindshell backdoor. Remove <tt>/usr/bin/prnmon</tt> (Sorry, I said this was /usr/bin/sh2 in my mail, I forgot I renamed it!). Edit <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond</tt> and remove the line that starts up <tt>/usr/bin/prnmon</tt>. Remove my SUID shell in <tt>/tmp/.X11</tt>. Check <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> and remove the password hashes for the accounts near the top which shouldn't have passwords. Oh, and please talk to the management about marketing online properly, and get them to read the spam.abuse.net URL for information on what they're doing wrong. Oh, and <a href="http://www.cheepbytes.com">buy</a> the latest copy of Redhat, if you must use it, rather than leave an old pile of crap online.
