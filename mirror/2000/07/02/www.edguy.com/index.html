<p>Ok, well, MANY people reminded me bout hot to haxor your way into makein' a
roman candle... have phun you all!!! and to all a good night...</p>
<p>---Start- Hacking Roman Candles---</p>
<p>Roman candles are impressive to watch.  They are relatively difficult to<br>
make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they are well<br>
worth the trouble.<br>
<br>
1) Buy a 1/2 inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it with several<br>
   layers of paper and/or masking tape.  This must be done to prevent the tube<br>
   from exploding.  Cut the tube into about 10 inch lengths.<br>
<br>
2) Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy and the<br>
   drying agent.  About 1/2 of an inch is sufficient.<br>
<br>
3) Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy, and insert a<br>
   desired length of water proof fuse.  Make sure that the fuse fits tightly.<br>
<br>
4) Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the tube.<br>
<br>
5) Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired color.<br>
   Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and a small amount of<br>
   pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of 60% sparkler material / 20%<br>
   flash powder / 20% pyrodex.  After mixing the powders well, add water, one<br>
   drop at a time, and mixing continuously, until a damp paste is formed.<br>
<br>
   This paste should be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when<br>
   left alone. Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube.<br>
   Allow the ball to dry.<br>
<br>
6) When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube.  It should slide down fairly<br>
   easily.  Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack it gently<br>
   against the ball with a pencil.<br>
<br>
7) When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed in a<br>
   safe direction, light the fuse, and run.  If the device works, a colored<br>
   fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of about 30 feet.  This<br>
   height can be increased by adding a slightly larger powder charge in step<br>
   4, or by using a slightly longer tube.<br>
<br>
8) If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.<br>
<br>
9) The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets,<br>
   producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.</p>
