<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>Most of the bill's provision cover such non-discretionary operations as food stamps, the school lunch program and other domestic U.S. nutrition programs.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>The bill did not contain a measure that would have ended current U.S. unilateral food and medicine sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and North Korea. An agreement between anti-sanctions sponsors and the House Republican leadership allowed the measure to be removed from the farm spending </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>bill in return for an &quot;iron-clad&quot; promise that anti-sanctions legislation will be reintroduced to the farm spending package House-Senate conference report.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-NY, attempted to introduce an amendment that would have specifically ended a ban on food and medicine trade with Cuba, only to have the proposal struck down by sanctions opponents because it did not deal with appropriations--a violation of House rules.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>The bill funds the agriculture operations of USDA as well the Food and Drug Administration. The Forest Service--the single largest operation within USDA--is funded through the Interior Department appropriations. Most of the debate centered around amendments dealing with pharmaceuticals.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>Other amendments approved include:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>--A provision that would prevent FDA from enforcing laws that prevent U.S. citizens from traveling abroad to purchase pharmaceuticals for personal use.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>--A measure that would authorize the importation of prescription drugs produced in FDA-approved factories in Canada and Mexico.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk"><FONT SIZE=3>--A $15,000 cut from USDA's food Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) budget to protest the agency's inspection of Iranian farm goods.</FONT></FONT></P>
