<P>U.S. Rep. Bob Schaffer, R-CO, has urged the secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to approve an emergency grazing waiver for eastern Colorado's drought-stricken counties.</P>

<P>"Over the last few weeks, I have heard from farmers and ranchers in eastern Colorado who are facing pasture loss, crop failure and deteriorating hay conditions," said Schaffer. "My office has been speaking with Farm Service Administration (FSA) offices, in Colorado and Washington, DC, for more than a month. Although we have had staff-level discussions with the USDA, attempting to develop new remedies for these agriculture producers, the USDA has produced little. Hopefully, my formal request will elevate our concerns and those of the agriculture community."</P>

<P>Specifically, county FSAs are seeking a waiver to graze land managed under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). According to USDA policies, CRP land, which is normally off-limits to grazing, can qualify for a waiver, if moisture loss is 40% of normal over a four-month period. With the higher-than-normal moisture in May, waiver qualification falls short by less than 2% in some areas.</P>

<P>"We are simply requesting the secretary use common sense in making these waiver decisions. The government's system of evaluation is flawed, if only one criterion is used to determine drought conditions," said Schaffer. "Some counties have reported a 97% evaporation rate and hot winds up to 65 mph."</P>

<P>The USDA says once they grant waivers, CRP land can be opened in less than 24 hours for grazing.</P>
