Edwards Canvas, Inc., Pauls Valley, OK introduces the E-Z Riser extension system for grain trailers designed to increase the hauling capacity of any trailer. Using electric or hydraulic power, the E-Z Riser converts a hopper trailer into a high-side trailer in 15 seconds for light products, then after unloading, lowers with a push-button operation for better fuel economy and lets the trailer get into those low overhead loading spaces. Lifters and all mechanisms are safely outside the loading area, and just adds, 1,000 pounds to the trailer. For more information, circle No. 565 the Reader Reply Coupon.
