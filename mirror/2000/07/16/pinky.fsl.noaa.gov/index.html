    <P><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0">In </font><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">1846</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0">the 
      British colonial rulers of India sold the territory, including its populace 
      (by a sale deed called the </FONT><A HREF="TreatyofAmritsar.html"><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0">Treaty 
      of Amritsar</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0">, in return for a sum of money) 
      to a Hindu warlord who had no roots there. This warlord who bought himself 
      into royalty, styled himself as the Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir. The 
      acts of brutality during his regime have left bitter memories, some of which 
      persist to this present day. Several mosques were closed and occupied by 
      his forces. </font></P>
    <FONT COLOR="#c0c0c0"> 
    <P>The slaughtering of a cow was declared a crime punishable by death. Between 
      1925 and 1947 Maharajah Hari Singh continued this policy of discrimination 
      against the 94 percent Muslim majority. It was nearly 65 years ago, in 1931, 
      that the people of Kashmir made their first organised protest against Maharajah 
      Hari Singh's cruelty. That led to the "Quit Kashmir" campaign against the 
      Maharajah in 1946, and eventually to the Azad Kashmir movement which gained 
      momentum a year later. </P>
    <P>The first armed encounter between the Maharajah's troops and insurgent 
      forces occurred in August 1947. At this time, Britain was liquidating its 
      empire in the subcontinent. Faced with a insurgency of his people, strengthened 
      by a few hundred civilian volunteers from Pakistan, Maharajah fled to Jammu 
      on 25th October 1947. In Jammu, after he ascertained a commitment of military 
      assistance from the government of India to crush the impending revolution 
      in Kashmir, he is alleged to have signed an "Instrument of Accession" to 
      India. </P>
    <P>Lord Mountbatten conditionally accepted the "Instrument of Accession" on 
      behalf of the British Crown, and furthermore, outlined the conditions for 
      official acceptance in a letter dated 27th October 1947: </P>
    <P>"In consistence with their policy that in the case of any (native) state 
      where the issue of accession has been subject of dispute, the question of 
      accession should be decided in accordance with the wishes of the people 
      of the state, it is my government's wish that as soon as law and order have 
      been restored in Kashmir and her soil cleared of the invaders the question 
      of state's accession should be settled by a reference to the people." </P>
    <P>Then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, in a speech aired on All­India 
      Radio (2nd November 1947), reaffirmed the Indian Government's commitment 
      to the right of the Kashmiri people to determine their own future through 
      a plebiscite: </P>
    <P>"We have declared that the fate of Kashmir is ultimately to be decided 
      by the people. That pledge we have given, and the Maharajah has supported 
      it, not only to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, but also to the world. 
      We will not and cannot back out of it. We are prepared when peace and law 
      have been established to have a referendum held under international auspices 
      like the United Nations. We want it to be a fair and just reference to the 
      people and we shall accept their verdict." </P>
    <P>The Government of India accepted the "Instrument of accession" conditionally, 
      promising the people of the state and the world at large that "accession" 
      would be final only after the wishes of the people of the state were ascertained 
      upon return of normalcy in the state. </P>
    <P>Following this, India moved her forces into Srinagar and a drawn-out fight 
      ensued between Indian forces and the forces of liberation. The forces of 
      Azad Kashmir successfully resisted India's armed intervention and liberated 
      one­third of the State. Realising it could not quell the resistance, India 
      brought the issue to the United Nations Security Council in January 1948. 
      As the rebel forces had undoubtedly been joined by volunteers from Pakistan, 
      India charged Pakistan with having sent "armed raiders" into the state, 
      and demanded that Pakistan be declared an aggressor in Kashmir. Furthermore, 
      India demanded that Pakistan stop aiding freedom fighters, and allowing 
      the transit of tribesmen into the state. </P>
    <P>After acceptance of these demands, coupled with the assurance that all 
      "raiders" were withdrawn, India would enable a plebiscite to be held under 
      impartial auspices to decide Kashmir's future status. In reply, Pakistan 
      charged India with having manoeuvred the Maharajah's accession through "fraud 
      and violence" and with collusion with a "discredited" ruler in the repression 
      of his people. Pakistan's counter complaint was also coupled with the proposal 
      of a plebiscite under the supervision and control of the United Nations 
      to settle the dispute. </P>
    <P>The Security Council exhaustively discussed the question from January until 
      April of 1948. It came to the conclusion that it would be impossible to 
      determine responsibility for the fighting and futile to blame either side. 
      Since both parties desired that the question of accession should be decided 
      through an impartial plebiscite, the Council developed proposals based on 
      the common ground between them. </P>
    <P>These were embodied in the resolution of 21st April 1948, envisaging a 
      cease-fire, the withdrawal of all outside forces from the State, and a plebiscite 
      under the control of an administrator who would be nominated by the Secretary 
      General. For negotiating the details of the plan, the Council constituted 
      a five­member commission known as "United Nations Commission for India and 
      Pakistan" (UNCIP) to implement the resolution. </P>
    <P>After the cease-fire, India began efforts to drag the issue down, and under 
      various pretexts tried to stop the UN resolution from being implemented. 
      To this day, India pursues the same plan, and the resolution of 1948 has 
      yet to be realised. </P>
    <P>India and Pakistan were at war over Kashmir from 1947­48 and all early 
      U. N. Security Council Resolutions contained admonishment for both countries 
      demanding an immediate cease-fire, which would be followed by a-UN directed 
      Plebiscite. However, disregarding that some fifteen resolutions were passed 
      by the United Nations to this very effect, India and Pakistan again initiated 
      military skirmish in 1965. At this point, another cease-fire agreement was 
      effected after United Nations intervention, followed by an agreement at 
      Tashkent with the good offices of the USSR. </P>
    <P>In 1971, India and Pakistan once again became locked in war. Efforts to 
      bring the latest conflict to an end resulted in the Simla Agreement and 
      was signed by both India and Pakistan and declared commitment to reach a 
      "final settlement" on the Kashmir issue, but this has yet to happen. </P>
