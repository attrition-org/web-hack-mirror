<P>1.  <U>General</U>.  The purpose of this annex is to supplement reference (a) in providing direction and guidance concerning meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) services and support throughout SEVENTHFLT. All SEVENTHFLT units must be familiar with reference (a).</P>

</U>
<P><spacer type=horizontal size=25>a.  Concept of Operations. SEVENTHFLT ships will receive and provide support as specified in reference (a) and this annex. Routine services include warnings of severe weather conditions, weather and oceanographic analyses and forecasts as described in this ANNEX.  Ensure COMSEVENTHFLT is information addressee on requests for special METOC services.</P>


<p><spacer type=horizontal size=25>b.  <U>Tasks and Responsibilities</U>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25>(1) Commander, SEVENTH Fleet will:</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25>(a) Coordinate the METOC support requirements of assigned units with those of other commands, subordinates, and friendly forces as required.</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25>(b) Monitor METOC services provided in the SEVENTHFLT AOR.</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25>(2) Officers in Tactical Command (OTC) will:</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25><spacer type=horizontal size=25>(a) Use sound judgement and prudent seamanship in making decisions to avoid potentially damaging weather.</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=75>(b) Report hazardous weather conditions and storm evasion actions in accordance with Appendix 1 of reference (a).</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=75>(c) Request Optimum Track Ship Routing (OTSR) for all open-ocean transits of units or individual ships.  OTSR is provided through the movement reporting system.  OTSR procedures and services are described in Appendix 3 and reference (b).</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=75>(d) Provide weather observations in accordance with Appendix 2 and reference (c).</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=100>(1)  Very few surface weather observation stations are available in oceanic areas.  The quality and quantity of METOC forecasts provided to fleet units are directly proportional to the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) observations provided by the units themselves.  METOC observational and reporting responsibilities of SEVENTHFLT units are set forth in this annex.</P>

<P><spacer type=horizontal size=100>(2)  In order to improve METOC support, comments are solicited from all levels of command regarding the effectiveness of the support received.  Such comments, both favorable and unfavorable, will be forwarded to NAVPACMETOCCEN Pearl Harbor, HI/NAVPACMETOCCEN West Guam/NAVPACMETOCFAC Yokosuka, JA, with an information copy provided to COMSEVENTHFLT.</P>

<P>3.  <U>Command and Signal</U>.  Individual units are encouraged to obtain and utilize METOC products available over the SIPRNET/NIPRNET and facsimile broadcasts from nnaval meteorology and oceanography centers and facilities.  Information on web-based METOC products and both fleet broadcasts and the internet is available from the nearest naval meteorology and oceanography activity.</P>
