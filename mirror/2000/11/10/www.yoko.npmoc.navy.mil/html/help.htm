structured similarly. If any assistance is required, that guidance is listed

below:

current announcements about the web and the center itself, from product

updates to upcoming events.&nbsp;



<P> <B>The Products Areas</B> are a repository of METOC products

served to the Naval METOC community by the center. Regional products can

be accessed by clicking on the applicable area.  The Exercise and Special Support

Sections are established for tailored exercise and special operations support.


<P><B>The Related Links Section</B> is a collection of links

to other METOC-related sites outside of the Naval METOC operational product
