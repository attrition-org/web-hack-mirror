<p>No more l33t talk, makes me lame. Admin i've patched your vulnerability.
<br>If you need more help, then e-mail me at <b><a href="mailto:azndragon@hushmail.com">azndragon@hushmail.com</a></b>.
Plz
<br>don't send me any e-mails on how to hack or deface stuff. Read my friend.
<p>I find it to be pretty funny, hackers targeting big names which are
hosted by
<br>foreign servers. I guess that their expertise-levels aren't high enough
to target
<br>the .com or .net ones. Anyway, flame me if you want, if not, then shut
up. ok?
<p>I like this one:
