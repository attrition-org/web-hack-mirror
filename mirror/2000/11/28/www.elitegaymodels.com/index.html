<img src="SW_DreamScape.jpg"><br><tt>Old logo, new attitude.</tt><p>
I was bored, had nothing else to do before I went to sleep.  So I hacked you. 
No passwords were used nor needed.  You just fell randomly victim to hacking at its finest. 
It's called hacking the actual server, not using some crappy ass program off of someone else's 
web site and saying YOU did it.  b/c You didn't!<p>
We used a program that we created called Terminal Killer v1.2 that is configurable and therefore configured it 
to your server especially.  Lucky you!  lol<p>
I can tell that you bought this crappy space from someone else, so I'd say to contact them and tell 
them to fix their servers accordingly.  The logs have been deleted accordingly, and/or changed to someone 
else's IP address and network name - what?  You think I'm stupid or something?<p>
Anywayz, if you're interested, you or your administrator can Email me at <a href="mailto:dreamscape@nightkingdoms.net">
dreamscape@nightkingdoms.net</a> to find to ask any questions.  Free account, don't bother trying anything.  Nothing was harmed, except for your pride and various log files.<p>
Only thing left to say is my shout outs.  I will leave until then....<p>
