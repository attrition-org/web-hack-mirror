<b>Aiwa is the leading audio entertainment brand in the UK because it provides high quality products at affordable prices.</b><p>

<font size=+1><i>How has this been achieved?</i></font><p>


<b>The quest for sensible innovation</b><br>
Since 1951 Aiwa has specialised in <b>high quality</b> audio products, continually developing and introducing new technologies to business and consumer markets throughout the world. Today, Aiwa places even more importance on performance, quality and innovation, and invests an unusually high proportion of sales income to research & development.<p>

This continuous investment means that Aiwa customers, in turn, continue to enjoy benefits that match their lifestyles. Recent examples are valuable features such as anti-shock personal CD players for sports and fitness enthusiasts and the award-winning anti-theft device integrated in many VCRs to reduce crime.<p>

<b>Pioneers of modern business efficiency</b><br>
To ensure and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction, Aiwa has lead the industry in the introduction of new manufacturing and process systems, together with innovative management techniques aimed at reducing costs as well as improving quality. It is this crucial combination of high quality and lower cost which differentiates Aiwa from the majority of its competitors. Quite simply, it results in <b>better value for money</b>.<p>

<b>Retaining quality whilst reducing cost</b><br>
The concept of value for money lies at the heart of Aiwa's success: it was one of the first Japanese companies to recognise that product quality must be maintained at the expense of company overheads. Long before most other Japanese corporations, for example, Aiwa determined to increase its manufacturing operations in territories where costs are lower. The decision to reduce operations in Japan was a brave but enlightened one, and the resulting, often quite dramatic, savings were immediately passed on to customers. Today, around 90% of all Aiwa products are made outside Japan with increasingly local sourcing of parts and materials. Just one example of this policy was the establishment of a significant manufacturing facility in Gwent, South Wales as early as 1980.
Aiwa has also pioneered new developments in logistics to maintain the pressure on costs. Components move smoothly and efficiently from suppliers through assembly, enabling finished products to reach retailers promptly by eliminating expensive delays.<p>

<b>Meeting the challenge</b><br>
Customers demand quality - a stimulating but rewarding challenge which Aiwa relishes as it continually identifies and implements new ways to provide greater quality at lower cost.<p>
