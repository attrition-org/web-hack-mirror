<p>
Aiwa is the leading audio entertainment brand in the UK because it provides high quality 
products at affordable prices.
<p>
Since 1951 Aiwa has specialised in <b>high quality</b> audio products, continually developing 
and introducing new technologies to business and consumer markets throughout the world. Today, 
Aiwa places even more importance on performance, quality and innovation, and invests an 
unusually high proportion of sales income to research &amp; development.
<p>
This continuous investment means that Aiwa customers, in turn, continue to enjoy benefits that 
match their lifestyles. Recent examples are valuable features such as anti-shock personal CD 
players for sports and fitness enthusiasts and the award-winning anti-theft device integrated 
in many VCRs to reduce crime.
<p>
To ensure and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction, Aiwa has lead the industry in the 
introduction of new manufacturing and process systems, together with innovative management 
techniques aimed at reducing costs as well as improving quality. It is this crucial combination 
of high quality and lower cost which differentiates Aiwa from the majority of its competitors. 
Quite simply, it results in <b>better value for money</b>.
<p>
The concept of value for money lies at the heart of Aiwa's success: it was one of the first 
Japanese companies to recognise that product quality must be maintained at the expense of 
company overheads. Long before most other Japanese corporations, for example, Aiwa determined 
to increase its manufacturing operations in territories where costs are lower. The decision to 
reduce operations in Japan was a brave but enlightened one, and the resulting, often quite 
dramatic, savings were immediately passed on to customers. Today, around 90% of all Aiwa 
products are made outside Japan with increasingly local sourcing of parts and materials. Just 
one example of this policy was the establishment of a significant manufacturing facility in 
Gwent, South Wales as early as 1980.
<p>
Aiwa has also pioneered new developments in logistics to maintain the pressure on costs. 
Components move smoothly and efficiently from suppliers through assembly, enabling finished 
products to reach retailers promptly by eliminating expensive delays.
<p>
Customers demand quality - a stimulating but rewarding challenge which Aiwa relishes as it 
continually identifies and implements new ways to provide greater quality at lower cost.
