<p>Now I am going to bitch about a few people out there.

<br>CPT, coax.

<br>Your gay.

<br>You and your IRIX hacking, talking shit about RSH, has to stop.

<br>No one fears your guest:guest skills.

<br>CPT, your talking shit about rsh

<br>"Fuck you to the biggest faggot of them all rsh, cuz he and...."

<br>wtf.

<br>RSH is a group, dumbass.

<br>Maybe before you go off with your brutus.exe, you could maybe learn

a thing or two about who your fucking with?

<br>Next..

<br>its caox.

<br>He hacked silicon graphics in korea.

<br>how?

<br>That's right, the much feared guest:guest account! OMG! COAX DON'T

HACK ME!

to smack you upside the head.

<br><b>ANYWAYS..</b>

<br>lets talk about a few "hackers", who call themselves m0r0n and
nightman.

<br>Uh.. I am glad you stopped "hacking". I was getting really sick and

tired of your stupid long echo's to index.htm, using the fearable rds
exploit.

<p>80m crew.. what happened to you? did your guest:guest accounts run out

on ya?

<br>(yeah its wierd, everyone who steps up uses guest:guest accounts)

<br>Calling us amd-hack.c kiddies, hahah.

<br>Do you even know what AMD is?

<br>Or are you trying so hard to make people think 80m = adm, when in
fact,

it doesn't?
