	As my dear friend Thomas Paine once said, these *are* the times
that try mens' souls. We're faced with the realization that the united
states government was never meant to scale to the level at which it
currently sits. It seems hard to believe that those distinguished
gentlemen, sitting back in that dusty hall in Philadelphia, ever imagined
a nation as large and as populous as our own. Indeed, Jefferson himself
faced the first indicator of this woeful inability to scale when faced
with the Louisiana Purchase. It came down to this great man, who had
crafted so much, that for all their wisdom and caring and structure, they
had made a country in which there were no rules set for expansion. And
ever since, this maxim, this lack of foresight in men so far sighted, has
throttled and crushed this nation in so many different ways. 
	George W. Bush would make a great president for those states which
traffic not so much in deceny but bigotry. Not acceptance but hate. Not
love but fear. There is no sense of human camaraderie amongst those who
live south of the Mason-Dixon line. At least, no camaraderie for those
whose appearance is not completely and utterly similar to one's own self. 
	So gays, blacks, latinos, and even women, (once they've been
knocked up and sent into a nine month hibernation until they can produce a
male heir,) are treated as less than human. They're not even given the
3/5ths that slaves once were. Their manifest destiny is serving that great
tyrant, the straight white male. 
	And don't presume that I'm unaware of how cliche that may sound.
But sometimes, lord, sometimes cliches prove to be a great truth. And
there is no greater truth in American than the straight white male's
dominance and his Aesopian desire to keep it. I myself seem to be the very
same thing as all the other swine who run this country. For a guy like me,
a vote for Bush is like a vote for continued prosperity. 
	But as the scum also rises, so the sun also sets. 
	I can not conscience vote for Bush. A vote for Bush is a vote
for myself. A vote for Bush is a vote for myself at the expense of
everyone else living in this strange and savage land. For whatever reason,
be it upbringing, my parents, or perhaps even brain damage, I reject the
idea of voting simply for myself. A vote should be cast not simply on
personal issues, but on one's feeling on how your vote will affect the
whole country. 
	Voting for Bush would be voting for myself and voting against
anyone not like me. We don't need to talk about the supreme court, or Al
Gore's endless babbling about that tax cut for the top 1%, because like
your fuzzy mathed lockboxes, it's seared into the American
consciousness. I don't need give you reasons. If you can not see them
yourself, then nothing will ever remove the blinders. 
	Gore isn't the best of men, but I refuse to be stuck in the same
arrested adolesence as all of America's luxury classed celebrities, who
presume that you can only vote for a candidate if his views tally 100%
with your own. That is the folly of the spoiled. Nor can I pretend that
the differences between Gore & Bush are unpronounced. If you believe that,
then Bush has played you as he wanted to play you. He's run as a moderate
Democrat on Democrat issues. It amazes me that all you woeful cynics of
the political process who don't buy the hype have bought the hype so
deeply. 
	Bush is a man whose entire life has been spent in the shadow of a
superior father, and remembering back to those awful days of 1988-1992,
it's hard to imagine Sr. being very superior to anyone, but Dubbya has
used the Senior as his prototype. He's the classic Oedipal, even if that
does mean we must consider the horrific possibility of School Marm Barb
having sex with either George. He's spent his entire life trying to please
his dorky father, and once he gets in office, do you think that's going to
change? He'll mirror Papa's policies as quickly as hate crimes legislation
can be shot down. 
	Again, Gore ain't the best of men, but he's a good man, and he's a
smart man. He may very well be smarter than any man who has ever been
President. He's a fascinating intellect, and while he's a little to the
right of where I wish he'd be, at least he truly understands governmental
compassion, rather than giving it the thin lipped service of W. 
	This election won't affect me in any way. Either way, I'm going to
float to the top. However, I comprehend the effects of my vote on the rest
of the populace, and can not be irresponsible with it. I must vote, as
dear self-aggrandizing Ralph Nader & his chorus of increasingly
irrelevant celebrities have said, "my conscience". My conscience tells me
that I shouldn't fuck over people over for my own self, nor should I
maintain some lofty ideal of a true progressive movement when that
self-same progressive movement can't attract any minorities or gays, and
serves as the political equivalent of a country club for the spoiled and
overpriviledged. 
	As such, I must vote Gore, and I urge you to do so.
