      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">DEIR YASSIN MASSACRE - DEIR YASSIN MASSACRE: 
        9-10 April 1948: The massacre that became the symbol of Zionist aggression 
        fo the Palestinians as well as Zionist treachery. The Mukhtar of the village 
        had agreed with the Zionists to provide information on the movement of 
        strangers in the area as well as other intelligence provided their village 
        is spared. The Zionists were not to keep their side of the promise. In 
        an operation which was called Operation Unity, the Haganah co-operated 
        with the Irgun and the Stern Gang is this operation. At 4:30 am on Friday 
        9th April 1948 surrounded the village which was overlooked by two Jewish 
        settlements, Givat Shaul and Montefiore. For two days Zionist terrorists 
        killed men women and children, raped women and stole their jewellery. 
        A chilling account of the massacre is given by a Red Cross doctor who 
        arrived at the village on the second day and saw himself -- the mopping 
        up as one of the terrorists put it to him. He says that the mopping gup- 
        had been done with machine guns, then grenades and finished of with knives. 
        Women's bellies were cut open and babies were butchered inthe hands of 
        their helpless mothers. Around 250 people were murdered in cold blood. 
        Of them 25 pregnant women were bayoneted in the abdomen while still alive. 
        52 children were maimed under the eyes of their own mothers, and they 
        were slain and their heads cut off. The Jewish Agency and the commander 
        of the British ground troops knew of the massacre while it was going on, 
        however, no one intervened to stop it. NASER AL-DIN MASSACRE </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> NASER AL-DIN MASSACRE: 13-14 April 1948, 
        a contingent of Lehi and Irgon entered this village (near Tiberias) entered 
        the village on the night of 13 April dressed as Arab fighters. Upon their 
        entrance to the village the people went out to greet them, the terrorists 
        met them with fire, killing every single one of them. Only 40 people survived. 
        All the houses of the village were raised to the ground. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">BEIT DARAS MASSACRE - BEIT DARAS MASSACRE: 
        21 May 1948, aftera number of failed attempts to occupy this village, 
        the Zionists mobilized a large contingent and surrounded the village. 
        The people of Beit Daras decided that women and children should leave. 
        As women and children left the village they were met by the Zionist army 
        who massacred them despite the fact that they could see they were women 
        and children fleeing the fighting. THE DAHMASH MOSQUE MASSACRE -</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> THE DAHMASH MOSQUE MASSACRE: 11 July 
        1948, after the Israeli 89th Commando Battalion lead by Moshe Dayan occupied 
        Lydda, the Israelis told Arabs through loudspeakers that if they went 
        into a certain mosque they would be safe. In retaliation for a hand grenade 
        attack after the surrender that killed several Israeli soldiers, 80-100 
        Palestinians were massacred in the mosque, their bodies lay decomposing 
        for 10 days in the mid-summer heat. The mosque still stands abandoned 
        today. This massacre spread fear and panic among the Arab population of 
        Lydda and Ramle, who were then ordered to march out of these towns after 
        they were stripped of all personal belonging by Israeli soldiers. Yetzak 
        Rabin, Brigade Commander then says: - There was no way of avoiding the 
        use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march 
        ten to fifteen miles to the point where they met up with the legion-. 
        Most of the 60,000 inhabitants of Lyda and Ramble came to refugee camps 
        near Ramallah, around 350 lost their lives on the way through dehydration 
        and son stroke. Many survived by drinking their own urine. The conditions 
        in the refugee camps were to claim more lives.</font></p>
