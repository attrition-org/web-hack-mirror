Good afternoon.  I'm <b>Al Gore</b>, and I'd like to<p>
tell you about myself.<p>
I know a lot about hardship, because I came into<p>
this world as a poor<p>
black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of<p>
Tennessee.  I was born<p>
in a log cabin that I built with my own hands.<p>
I taught myself to read<p>
by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers<p>
and sisters by working<p>
summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River<p>
steamboat.<p>
My mother taught me the value of education, so<p>
every day, I would<p>
walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a<p>
mischievous, fun<p>
loving scamp, thought I never dreamed that one<p>
day, my youthful<p>
escapades would serve as the inspiration for<p>
"Huckleberry Finn."<p>
<br>
Back then, black folks in the south were<p>
second-class citizens.<p>
One day, a  traveling minister came through<p>
town, and I asked him if<p>
anyone was ever going to do something to<p>
guarantee civil rights for all<p>
Americans. Well, I guess I made an impression.<p>
You see, the minister's<p>
name was Martin Luther King, Jr.<p>
<br>
My father was a United States Senator. He once<p>
perched me on his<p>
knee and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen<p>
to your mama, someday<p>
you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and<p>
go to an exclusive prep<p>
school." But life of privilege was not for me.<p>
After getting my high<p>
school diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty<p>
textile mill.  I was so<p>
appalled at the treatment of the workers there<p>
that I organized a union.<p>
Later,that experience inspired a movie - which<p>
is why, to this day, my<p>
close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma<p>
Rae."<p>
<br>
When word got out what an 18 year old factory<p>
worker had done,<p>
Harvard called and offered me a scholarship.  I<p>
captained the hockey<p>
team to four consecutive national championships,<p>
but I also played<p>
football and was good enough to win the Heisman<p>
Trophy.  During my<p>
college years, I lived in a  housing project and<p>
moonlighted playing<p>
lead guitar for a little rockband. You may have<p>
heard of it -- the<p>
Rolling Stones.<p>
<br>
But there was a war going on, and I felt I had<p>
to serve my<p>
country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and<p>
went to Vietnam.  I was<p>
deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as<p>
a soldier and came back<p>
home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de<p>
Guerre.<p>
<br>
When I got back, I took a long journey across<p>
this great land of<p>
ours. I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've<p>
breathed the mountain<p>
air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share,<p>
man, I've been everywhere.<p>
And the people I met at truckstops and<p>
campgrounds and homeless shelters<p>
on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we<p>
need you in<p>
Washington."<p>
<br>
I knew they were right, but first I had to take<p>
care of some other<p>
business---building the World Trade Center,<p>
founding the Audubon<p>
Society, doing the clinical research that proved<p>
smoking caused cancer,<p>
and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field's<p>
chocolate chip cookies.<p>
<br>
Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people<p>
of Tennessee and<p>
allowed them to elect me to the House of<p>
Representatives and the<p>
Senate. And then one winter day nearly nine<p>
years ago, for no particular<p>
reason, I answered the call of the people once<p>
again and took the oath<p>
of office as Vice President of the United<p>
States.<p>
<br>
Since then, I've been part of the most<p>
successful administration<p>
in American history.  Many times Bill Clinton<p>
has been pondering some<p>
grave decision and has asked me what to do.  And<p>
when I would give him<p>
my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of<p>
course.  That's brilliant.<p>
Why didn't I think of that?" During the darkest<p>
days of the impeachment<p>
battle, the president told me he only wished he<p>
had listened when I told<p>
him to stay away form that dark-haired intern.<p>
<br>
So after I decided to run for president, I sat<p>
down with him and<p>
asked if he had any suggestions about how to<p>
conduct my campaign.  And<p>
Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of<p>
advice -- words I'll never<p>
forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said,<p>
"Al, just tell the truth,<p>
it's always worked for me."<p>
