You have the balls to tell us "Who the fuck is going to deface a .kr site
with ./telnetd and call us lame", you can go fuck yourself!
Cuz this proves it dumbshits...aint no telnetd with Linux as of YET!
You sit there and deface a godamn web server that just happens to have
700+ hosts on it, lucky if you ask me, but still 700 is sehun-hundread!

I heard that you guys sit there and jerk each other off right before you
"attempt" DoS a site. Well listen here jerko, time for me to put the
hammer down on j00, consider this a gdb core dump in j0r moufh sucka!
