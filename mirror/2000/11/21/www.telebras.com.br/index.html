Was so easy to enter and map network drives and access classified files as I was 
accessing my home computer. <BR><BR>
The <B>BRANATEL</B> machine was the most interesting, with many classified datafiles and 
information.<BR>
The PDC and BDC are both compromised now, because I had access to all the passwords intheir. The 
PDC crack engine I wrote in VB took about 70 minutes to crack more than 8 passwords. Passwords like: faugusto with username faugusto were 
so easy to broke. 

<BR><BR>
All this means that this noone can trust in this system, with a DUMMY FIREWALL and no Intrusion Detection system to broke.
