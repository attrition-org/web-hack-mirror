<font size=+1>This server was defaced
by H3X0r666</font><b></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont wanna make some fancy page here, I'm little
tired of hacking webpages like I'm some skript-kiddie ...
<br>This server was penetrated to establish a new record. The number of
virtual hosts that were defaced is about <b>798</b> (!)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLIENTS OF ONEPINE.COM : Please take notice that
the ISP (onepine.com) is filled with professionals that know how to make
your money worth. But H3X0r666 is on rampage now and nothing could stop
him hehehe. I have searched for a job in computer security business for
2 months now and I&nbsp;found nothing and that's why I'm back doing stupid
stuff like defacing harmless servers. >x-{&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; For the administrator : you are really kewl man.. It was really
hard to hack your network. Bigger ISPs are easyer to penetrate.I didn't
steal any important files on your server, I didn't&nbsp; harm your server
in any way.. and there were credit-cards to steal , clients to harm (I
know some guys who would payed big bucks for www.jewishforum.com),backdoors
to put, DDOS to perform etc.etc.. I did a free secuity audit here and I
didn't hide my tracks.. If you have problems renaming the /var/www/conf/httpd.h3x0r_is_today_a_good_guy
into /var/www/httpd.conf mail me at : <a href="mailto: H3X0r@linuxfreak.com">H3X0r@linuxfreak.com</a>
:-}
<p>CLIENTS OF ONEPINE.COM --> This is a god damn good server .. trust-it
<br>&nbsp;
<p>bye bye .. and god bless ya
