      <p><font color="#00FF40">YEHIDA MASSACRE: 13 December 1947: men of the Arab 
        village of Yehida (near Petah Tekva, the first Zionist settlement to be 
        established) met at the local coffee house when they saw a British Army 
        patrol enter the village, they were reassured especially that Jewish terrorists 
        had murdered 12 Palestinians the previous day. The four cars stopped in 
        front of the cafe house and out stepped men dressed in khaki uniforms 
        and steel helmets. However, it soon became apparent that they had not 
        come to protect the villagers. With machine guns they sprayed bullets 
        into the crowd gathered in the coffee house. Some of the invaders placed 
        bombs next to Arab homes while other disguised terrorists tossed grenades 
        at civilians. For a while it seemed as if the villagers would be annihilated 
        but soon a real British patrol arrived to foil the well organized killing 
        raid. The death toll of seven Arab civilians could have been much higher. 
        Earlier the same day six Arabs were killed and 23 wounded when home made 
        bombs were tossed at a crowd of Arabs standing near the Damascus Gate 
        in Jerusalem. In Jaffa another bomb killed six more Arabs and injured
