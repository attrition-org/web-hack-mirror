        <p>HI FEDS!<br>
        </p>
        <p>WE ARE HAPPY FOR THOSE ISRALEAN ATTACKS, AND LOOK FORWARD IN PARTICIPATING 
          IN IT!<br>

        <p>Early in the morning of April 9, 1948, commandos of the Irgun (headed 
          by Menachem Begin) and the Stern Gang attacked Deir Yassin, a village 
          with about 750 Palestinian residents. The village lay outside of the 
          area to be assigned by the United Nations to the Jewish State; it had 
          a peaceful reputation. But it was located on high ground in the corridor 
          between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Deir Yassin was slated for occupation 
          under Plan Dalet and the mainstream Jewish defense force, the Haganah, 
          authorized the irregular terrorist forces of the Irgun and the Stern 
          Gang to perform the takeover. In all over 100 men, women, and children 
          were systematically murdered. Fifty three orphaned children were literally 
          dumped along the wall of the Old City where they were found by Miss 
          Hind Husseini and brought behind the American Colony Hotel to her home 
          which was to become the Dar El-Tifl El-Arabi orphanage. Part of the 
          struggle for self determination by Palestinians has been to tell the 
          truth about Palestinians as victims of Zionism. For too long their history 
          has been denied and this denial has only served to further oppress and 
          deliberately dehumanize Palestinians in Israel, inside the occupied 
          territories, and outside in their diaspora. Some progress has been made. 
          Westerners now realize that Palestinians, as a people, do exist. And 
          they have come to acknowledge that during the creation of the state 
          of Israel thousands of Palestinians were killed and over 700,000 were 
          driven or frightened from their homes and lands on which they had lived 
          for centuries. </p>
