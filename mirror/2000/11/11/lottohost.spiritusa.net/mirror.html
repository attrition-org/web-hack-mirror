Al Gore, Ladies and Gentleman, has learned something the rest of us do not know!
A new mathematical law has been found by the Gore campaign which&nbsp; states
that continual reevaluation of data which renders unexpected results will cause
an eventual magical transformation of the original data.&nbsp; Very sneaky Al...<br>
Did you discover this law before or after you invented the Internet?&nbsp; The
example you are setting is one that you should be ashamed of.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
You, Mr. Would-be Leader, are making the United States of America the laughing
stock of the known world.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about the butterfly ballot:&nbsp; Voting for the next President of
the USA is a privilege and responsibility every American shares.&nbsp; With this
privilege comes a responsibility to pay attention to what you are doing, think
about the weight of your decision, and make sure that you make your opinion
count by carefully considering the ballot put in front of you.&nbsp; If you cant
do that, then fuck you and your vote. The ballot had a BOLD arrow pointing at
each dot and each arrow was CLEARLY associated with ONE candidate.&nbsp; The
ballot was considered to be legal and approved through the appropriate channels
before it ever reached the voting booth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF00">To those of you who couldn't figure out a piece of paper
with some holes in it:&nbsp;<br>
