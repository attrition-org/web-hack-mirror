    Statement</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Since 1902, Meredith Corporation has focused on providing our customers
    with products and services that distinguish themselves on the basis of quality, customer
    service and value. Our Online Privacy Policies are designed to help us serve our customers
    while meeting their privacy expectations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We are a member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and Magazine
    Publishers of America (MPA) and support self-regulation by these industry associations. We
    believe this is the best way to maintain good customer service while addressing the
    privacy concerns of our customers. Also, we actively participate in the DMA Privacy
    Committee, the DMA Ethics Operating Committee, and the MPA New Media Committee. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Additionally, we fully support and use the DMA Mail and Telephone
    Preference Services through which individuals may restrict the release of their names for
    marketing purposes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">When you register with our sites, enter contests or purchase items
    online, you may request that we remove your name from our marketing lists by sending an
    email message indicating your wish to restrict offers made to you.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Our Web sites automatically recognize some information about our
    visitors, including the company that provides their internet service. Our sites do not
    automatically recognize the name, address, e-mail address or similar information specific
    to an individual. Such identifying information is recorded only if you supply it to us via
    an e-mail, bulletin board message, or online form. Our &quot;cookie&quot; technology
    allows us to record how many times you visit our site and it helps us manage content. This
    information allows us to better serve visitors to the site and is not rented or sold to
    any other company. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you send a comment or request information from us via email, you will
    receive future communication from us through email.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you contact us to order product, comment or request information and
    provide us with your postal mailing address, you&#146;ll be added to our database to
    receive future mailings.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Meredith occasionally makes the lists of postal addresses volunteered on
    its Web site available to other carefully screened associations or companies whose
    products or services we think you may find of interest. We pre-screen all use of our
    information for our customers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you do not wish to receive such mailings, simply contact us <a
    href="http://www.home-and-family.com/registration/optout.html">via email</a>. If you
    prefer to send your request via regular mail and you receive Meredith magazines, simply
    copy your mailing label address exactly (or clip it out) and send your request to our
    Circulation Department at 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309-3023. </font></p>
