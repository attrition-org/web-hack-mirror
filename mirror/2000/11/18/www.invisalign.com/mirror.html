well golly gosh gee! you've been tagged by the obz of fux0r inc. ! i know it's been a minute, did
ya'll miss me & my fetish for nt? well i tell ya now that ain't my ponejammeeh to be the latest thought hemmed up by the man see... neway things have been coo, i got myself a tight new ride to
make the girlies drool. just one of the benefits of my new j-o-b i do. however the downside is 
lack of time. hell yer lucky i got out to spit you this rhyme. but as for an update, fux0r's still
werkin. so far 13 conglomor4ts have been notified of potential o-days left lurkin. so you can tell
in their eye i still be doin the jerkin... and the next hurt, well its goin to a globally spread conglomor4t network. give you a hint on what? well it's never looked at, it's mainly with sco but 
but thats on the low, and as for specifics, well if you know what encadm is, you've got the right 
ticket. other than that theres not much to report, sept maybe we're lookin for new peoples to
join in our sport. oh and the main fux0r site will be opening before to long, but i know you've heard that so i guess i'm done for now, time to go get my bong...

a big fux0r yew tew: whoever the hell you can think of to lay blame on for this fucked up election, i mean we got the shit in florida, spank spank, the offshore crap, and that shit that happened in st. louis where some asshole judge overturned a decision to leave the polls open later for shift workers and closed them at regular time, turning away literally several hour long lines of voters (hmm would have been voting then? could it have maybe been the majority blue collar working man that the election is supposed to be working <i>for</i>?) uh huh, looks like the conglomor4t strikes again...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
