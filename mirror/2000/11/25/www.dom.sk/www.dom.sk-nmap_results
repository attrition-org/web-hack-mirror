Starting nmap V. 2.54BETA3 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Warning:  OS detection will be MUCH less reliable because we did not find at least 1 open and 1 closed TCP port
The 1 scanned port on www.dom.sk (195.28.98.225) is: closed
Too many fingerprints match this host for me to give an accurate OS guess
Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6 seconds
