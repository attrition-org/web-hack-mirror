Don't worry, i didn't delete any of your data.&nbsp; Neither did i stole
any data or back doored your webserver. I only wanted to show you for having
poor security. If you need help with fixing this, then e-mail me. Don't
feel special <b>at least</b> 15 webservers get defaced (publically) every
day and hundreds of webservers penetrated secretly by skilled hackers which
some of then warn the administrators by sending an e-mail with the problem
and sometimes the fix. Talking about Hyundai..., i actually do like your
cars, so Hyundai keep up the good job, and a better job with securing your
webservers for in the future. Also defacers, learn how to do some decent
HTML, even with a WYSIWYG editor, poor HTML shows that you're a lazy script-kiddie.
(Maybe you aren't, but that's the first impression people get). Some greetings
to: rfp, aleph one, trib, fux0r, Neon-Lenz, Herbless. There ain't no more
decent NT defacers out there.. pretty sad, maybe nexus, he's talented.</font></font></center>
