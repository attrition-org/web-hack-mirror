   About The Netcraft Web Server Query Form
   
   We report a site's operating system, web server, and netblock owner
   together with, if available, a graphical view of the time since last
   reboot for each of the computers serving the site. Further information
   about what we measure and how we measure it is and other factors
   affecting the monitoring process are available here.
   
   The graphs for each site display both the actual times since last
   reboot (as an X) and a moving average of uptime over time as a solid
   green area graph. The colour of the X changes in the event of the site
   switching operating system. A history of the operating system, web
   server and hosting location is also provided so it is possible to
   correlate these changes with the uptime of the site. When we are
   unable to get a valid uptime measurement for a site, a gap will appear
   in the plots of the raw data points.
   
   Queries are made on a daily basis, so the crosses on single server
   site will appear as a diagonal line moving forward through time until
   the next reboot. Sites using multiple front end servers with some form
   of load balancer will show parallel diagonal lines. A good example is
   the BBC site.
   
   Daily reports are generated showing the sites and hosting locations
   with the longest uptimes.
   
   Example Site 1 - www.qualcomm.com
   
   Uptime for www.qualcomm.com

   The chart shows the time since last reboot for www.qualcomm.com for
   the period commencing June 1999. Each small blue x represents a
   reading on a particular day.
   
   The site ran continuously from when we started to sample in June 1999,
   and that until August 99, when it was rebooted. In January 2000, the
   uptime drops, showing that the site had been moved to a new machine
   that had been up for a shorter time than the original machine. This
   coincides with a switch of hosting location as shown in the table
   below.
   
   OS,Web Server and Hosting History 
   OS Server Last changed IP address Netblock Owner
   Solaris Netscape-Enterprise/3.6 SP3 8 Jan 00 199.106.114.15 CERFnet
   customer - Qualcomm, Inc.
   Solaris Netscape-Enterprise/3.6 SP2 7 Jul 99 192.35.156.222 Qualcomm,
   Inc.
   
   From this table we can see that the site changed hosting location on
   the 8th of January 2000, and moved to another Solaris based system
   running a more recent version of Netscape-Enterprise.
   
   Example Site 2 - www.starbucks.com
   
   Uptime for www.starbucks.com 
   Note: Uptime - the time since last reboot is explained in the FAQ

   Starbucks.com is an example of a site that has switched operating
   systems. In the graph below, the blue crosses are NT4/Windows 98, and
   the red ones are Windows 2000. While running NT4/Windows 98, Starbucks
   rebooted their server on a daily basis, but since switching to Windows
   2000 in April the site had not been rebooted until early November.
