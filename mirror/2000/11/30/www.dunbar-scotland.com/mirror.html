<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#330099">Ah,bonny scotland -the land
of tight-fisted alchoholics.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#330099">The land where men wear skirts
with furry purses on front.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#330099">And the birthplace of
grounds-keeper Willy....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Q. What's the difference between a
bagpipe and an onion? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">A. No one cries when you chop up
an bagpipe. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Q. Why is a bagpipe like a Scud
missile? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">A. Both are offensive and
inaccurate. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">An Englishman, Irishman and
Scotsman went for a round of golf and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       their wives
went along as caddies. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       While
walking around the course the English man's wife caught her
foot</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       in a rabbit
hole, tripped up, and landed in a heap on the ground. Her</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       skirt was
over her head revealing that she wasn't wearing any
knickers!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       The
Englishman stormed over and angrily demanded a reason for
her</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       state of
undress. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       "Well
darling," she explained, "you give me so little allowance that
I</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       have to
make the odd sacrifice. Usually no one notices." </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       The
Englishman thrusts his hand into his pocket and said, "Here's
ten</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       pounds. Go
to Mark's and Spencer's and get some knickers." </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       Two holes
further along the Irish Man's wife caught her foot on a</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       molehill,
tripped up and landed in a heap on the ground. Again her
skirt</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       was up over
her head revealing that she wasn't wearing any knickers</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       either! The
Irish man was livid and he angrily demanded a reason for</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       her lack of
undergarments. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       "Well
darling," she explained, "you give me so little allowance I
cannot</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       afford to
buy undergarments." </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       With that
the Irish man thrust his hand into his pocket and said,
"Here's</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       five
pounds. Go to Woolworth's and get some knickers." </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       Three holes
further on, the Scottish man's wife caught her foot on an</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       exposed
root, tripped up and landed with her skirt over her head</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       revealing
that even she wore no knickers! Her explanation to her
irate</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       husband was
the same as the others. Simply a lack of allowance. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">                       The
Scottish man thrust his hand into his pocket and said, "Here's
a</FONT></P>
