Well children, it's stealth-fone yet again.<br>
Alot of people have a misconception of me that I would like to clear up.
I have nothing against any of the people involved with 2600, it's simply I
think you guys have lost touch with the idea 2600 should have been based on. 
No, not freedom of information as you would be so quick to blurt from your 
"hackers' manifesto" but telephony? 800 numbers to change the times on movie 
fone isn't quite what I would've expected from someone with the influence
that 2600 has behind them. But I guess when you release a telephony hacker
quarterly that happens. Maybe I'll start 'Linux: The Phreaker Quarterly' and
post a bunch of information on arcane operating systems and how to perform
DDoS.
