        December 1947: men of the Arab village of Yehiday (near Petah Tekva, the 
        first Zionist settlement to be established) met at the local coffee house 
        when they saw a British Army patrol enter the village, they were reassured 
        espeically that Jewish terrorists had murdered 12 Palestinians the previous 
        day. The four cars stopped in front of the cafe house and out stepped 
        men dressed in khaki uniforms and steel helmets. However, it soon became 
        apparent that they had not come to protect the villagers. With machine 
        guns they sprayed bullets into the crowd gathered in the coffee house. 
        Some of the invaders placed bombs next to Arab homes while other disguised 
        terrorists tossed grenades at civilians. For a while it seemed as if the 
        villagers would be annihilated but soon a real British patrol arrived 
        to foil the well organized killing raid. The death toll of 7 Arab civilans 
        could have been much higher. Earlier the same day 6 Arabs were killed 
        and 23 wounded when home made bombs were tossed at a crowd of Arabs standing 
        near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem. In Jaffa another bomb killed six 
        more Arabs and injured 40.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> KHISAS MASSACRE - KHISAS MASSACRE: 18 
        December 1947: Two carloads of Haganah terrorists drove through the village 
        of Khisas (on the Lebanese Syrian border) firing machine guns and throwing 
        grenades. 10 Arab civilians were killed in the raid. QAZAZA MASSACRE - 
        QAZAZA MASSACRE: 19 December 1947: 5 Arab children were murdered when 
        Jewish terrorists blew up the house of the village Mukhtar. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">AL-SHEIKH VILLAGE MASSACRE - AL-SHEIKH 
        VILLAGE MASSACRE: 1 January 1948: On that night around two hundred Zionists 
        armed with hand grenades and machine guns sneaked into a small village 
        called al-Shaikh village (5km South East of Haifa). The attackers came 
        through the southern hills (most possibly from Nisher Jewish settlement 
        wich lies about 5Km south of the village). They attacked the houses on 
        the edges of the village with hand-grenades and finished off with machine-guns 
        killing around 40 of the Palestinians inhibitants of the village, mostly 
        women and children.</font></p>
