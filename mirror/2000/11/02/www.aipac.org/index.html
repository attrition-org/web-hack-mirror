web site
<br>defaced and all of their users database is compromised. Yes, that includes
not only users

<p>I've put all the email addresses in a file so that you can have an nice
mailing list of 3500+ people

<p>The hack is to protest against the attrocities in Palestine by the barbarian
Israeli
<br>soldiers and their constant support by the US government.
<p>Instead of writing articles or putting pictures of Israel's atrocities
in Palestine, this
<br>time i've put emails and comments that i got from the web site.

<p><b>Some comments about the web site which i found in the database:</b>
<p>"You people are all bullshit"
<p>"You are an evil organisation whose only purpose is the destuction of
the arab world
<br>an israeli domination mayall your members ROT IN HELL ITS A SHAME HITLER
DIDNT FINISH
<br>WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO"
<p>"Shame on AIPAC for allowing the killing of millions of Iraqi children
because of economic
<br>sanctions.&nbsp; I just visited Iraq and witnessed myself the destruction."
<p>"Hi. I have a Jewish friend and she needs help. She got divorced because
an abusive
<br>relationship with a US Citizen. She is a resident and her kids (the
Government decided)
<br>are with the man. The kids have been neglected and abused (only physically),
but Child
<br>Protective Services is not doing anything about it. She has little
money, and she has
<br>turned to many people in search of help. She is lossing heart and Faith.
If you know of
<br>any organization that can help her, GOD will surelly bless this. The
case is so complex
<br>that these are just the main things. I'm not Jewish, but it hurts me
to see her in this
<br>condition. I tryed to contact Christian organizations, but she feels
intimidated ( I can
<br>understand that) and I don't want her to feel this way, that's why
I'm looking first with
<br>Jewish organizations. Thanks for your time.&nbsp; ****
<p><b>oOps..this one is not related..</b>
<p>"Please delete my name from your e-mail list and do not send me any
other messages.
<br>Today I have received over 100 identical messages from you concerning
your need to contact
<br>Congress. If you don't discontinue immediately, this will be reported
to MSN"
<p><b>I would like to quote some of the contents i got from the email database:</b>
<p>"To answer your question "Have you ever been to Israel?" I said No because
I have been to
<br>Palestine. Anyway, my comment here is you state in your section "The
Peace Process" you say:
<br>For 50 years, the U.S. and Israel have together pursued peace in the
Middle East!!
<br>How did israel do that? By killing, deporting and torturing the Palestinians?
<br>By killing pregnant women (1948), ripping their stomachs open and raping
them?
<br>By occupying our land in 1948 and 1967? By invading Lebanon? By dividing
the Arabs in
<br>the Middle East?&nbsp; Please, give me a break!!"
<p>"AIPAC has urged the Palestinians to "avoid unilateral actions that
might lead to violence.
<br>Was David Ben-Gurion's declaration of a Jewish State in May 1948 such
an example???
<br>Therefore, is the State of Israel illegal? From an email I received
Friday from
<br>****** ****** &lt;*******@palestinecenter.org>:
<br>"In November 1988, the Palestine National Council proclaimed the establishment
of the
<br>State of Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital." Did you know that?"
<p>"It is disturbing that you believe Jerusalem is the rightful capital
of Israel. On what
<br>logic or authority do you base this? From an unbiased perspecitive,
Jerusalem belongs to
<br>the natives of the country. Who are naturally Palestinian. As you probably
know, Israeli
<br>occupation is in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution
242 which posits
<br>the inadmissability of land acquired by war. Israeli occupation also
violates almost every
<br>article in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as set by the
United Nations in 1948.
<br>How are you able to justify and legitimate your human rights and International
law violations
<br>and feel righteous and arrogant about doing so? The irony of a persecuted
people occupying,
<br>colonizing, and denying the fundamental rights of another (Palestinians)
is hypocritical and
<br>criminal. You lack the the humanity for others that you demand for
yourselves."
<p>Thanks for your time.
<br><b>Peace</b>
