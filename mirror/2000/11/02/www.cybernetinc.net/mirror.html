<b>WHY DID I HACK THIS SITE?</b><br>
I defaced this website for 2 reasons.  First reason is because i was bored
and needed something to do. Second reason is because i wanted to 
let you know about carnivore.  Carnivore is a data-sniffing system which
will give the government access to 
read just about anyone's personal email, and possibly other data going
through your ISP.  I do not want my email being read and im sure you don't
either.  Carnivore is taking
away our rights of privacy.  Carnivore needs to be stopped.

<br>
ok im done.
