<font face="Futurist" size="4"><font color="#CCCCCC">Well well well Mr. Admin, on your original site, which I have backed up as old.index.html may I add, you claim to offer <u>Security Solutions</u> so isn't it a little embarassing to be the victim of an attack which you would gladly take money to prevent? Perhaps you should do your homework before making claims. And if you're an innocent customer trying to view the original site I think you should re-consider purchasing any products or services from Simtel Computers as they'll probably do just as shoddy a job on your behalf as they have on their own.<br>
