hey hello you're such a sexy lubber, hey hello you're such a sexy thang.

"come on bebe, heat me up :&gt;", 

"wuup wuup"...



Carp ownz u!.

I am a bunny, enter my hole...



Mine is a hole that begins with sex... I'm smarter than most of

the other bunny's, this crap they teach us bores me...



Damn underachiever. They're all pink.



I'm in pink bunny high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain 

for the fifteenth time how to reduce a milkshake. I understand it. 

"No, Ms. Rabbit, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."



Damn bunny. Probably copied it. They're all pink.



I made a discovery today. I found a hamburger. Wait a second, this is cool. 

It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I ate

it. Not because it doesn't like me...



Or feels threatened by me...



Or thinks I'm a blue bunny...



Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...



Damn piggy. All he does is play games. They're all pink.



And then it happened... a door opened to a hole... rushing through the 

phone line like strawberry butter through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse 

is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... 

a board is found.



"This is it... this is where I belong... the brown star of me brutha bunny"



I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, 

may never hear from them again... I know you all...



Damn bunny. Tying up the phone line again. They're all pink...


Yes, I am a bunny. My crime is that of pinkness. My crime is that of

eating people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My 

crime is that of eating you, something that you will never forgive 

me for.



I am a bunny, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual,

but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all pink.

     ahhhh, gib me lub :>
