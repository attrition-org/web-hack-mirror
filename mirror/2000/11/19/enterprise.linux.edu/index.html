Hmmmmmmm, linux education huh? You need to be educated about security issues. The kind that lurk on this system. This system was easily penetrated and taken down. <br><br>
I just want to say, if you want to talk shit to Root Shell Hackers, don't fucking waste your breath. If we gave a fuck what you thought, we'd stop defacing. If we wanted to hear your shit, we'd listen. Don't fucking come to our channel and start shit with everyone in there, 98% of the people in #rsh are just friends and people trying to learn. This is a fucking learning game. Why are you going to talk shit to someone trying to learn? That's ridiculous and makes you look like a moron. Who the fuck is going to deface a .kr site with ./telnetd and call us lame? Only a fucking moron. Whatever<br><br>
