      <td width=100% bgcolor=#CC3300><font face=Arial size=2>The US has
        done it again. The whole world is laughing at how the US has no idea who
        won the elections. All the squables over a few votes makes that
        electoral college look bad.</font>
        <p><font face=Arial size=2>I wonder what the founding fathers would
        have said if they had heard about this years elections. A dead man gets
        elected as senator because of &quot;memory&quot;, a few hundred people
        in Florida decide who becomes the president, marijuana laws for the ill
        pass in Nevade and Colorado, and here comes the kicker: Hillary Clinton,
        Bill Clintons wedded sidekick becomes senator of New York.</font></p>
        <p><font face=Arial size=2>While having a woman finally become an
        important part of the government is very good, I wonder if Hillary is
        such a good idea. She hardly knew anything about New York when she
        started, so don't expect her to know much about New York now even if she
        studied on it. And don't you as reader of this site believe that she
        should've given Bill the boot? Cheating on people is cheating on people,
        even if it is the president. What she did was just forgive him, she took
        the easy way out which means more money and prestige for her.</font></p>
        <p><font face=Arial size=2>Money and prestige aren't decent
        motivators. Be careful with your personal Clinton.</font>
