<FONT SIZE=+1>About 30% of the new students SJ enrolled each year are transfers.</FONT>&nbsp;
You are definitely not alone as a new transfer to SJ.</LI>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>SJ has a child care center.&nbsp;</FONT>
If you have children, SJ's child care center is licensed by the state to
provide care for infants (<I>six weeks to 17 months</I> <I>--- maximum
of six</I>), toddlers (<I>18 months and walking to 29 months--15 max</I>),
and 29 preschoolers and elementary agers.&nbsp; Fees are billed monthly
and vary with the age of the child.&nbsp; More information is available
from the Director of the Child Care Center <I>[(907)747-5240].</I></LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>SJ is a small college.</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>It
is difficult to get lost in the shuffle here.&nbsp; We believe that <B>effective</B>
education is primarily a <B>collaborative</B> process, requiring the interaction
of student with teacher:</LI>
<OL><I>The essence of higher education is a professor and a student meeting
in a room where they can call each other by name and hear each other speak.&nbsp;
The other, more expensive things--computers, high tech audiovisuals, administrators,
even transcripts--can be useful, but are not essential.</I>

Transfer students who have earned an associate degree at an accredited school are <U>not</U> required to take SJ's general education core courses, with one exception: one course in <I>"the world role of Christianity"</I> (unless you have already taken such a
course).</LI>
<LI>
For a private college, SJ's costs are remarkably <B>low</B>. Our 99-00 tuition (presuming <I>zero</I> financial aid--which is highly
 <B>un</B>likely!) is only <B>$6850</B> per year.&nbsp; (The average tuition
for four-year colleges in 98-99 was <B>$14,508</B> per year!)</B></LI>
