<ul>


<li>Work in the only college-owned private salmon hatchery in the U.S.</li>


<li>Field trips along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean.</li>


<li>Learn to recognize the finite nature of resource availability and the environment's incapability


to accommodate continued unlimited growth.</li>


<li>Acquire sensitivity to the cultural, environmental, economic, political and social concerns of


indigenous peoples of the Northeast Pacific.</li>

campus!</li></b></i></ul>
