&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, your suspicions are true: Sheldon Jackson did
not <B><I>really</I></B> look like our caricature of him. But the reason
we stylized him was because, as you probably know, photographs from his
era <I>(late 1800s) </I>always portrayed people unsmiling and austere.
And, if you read about Jackson the man, he was energetic and passionate--qualities
which don’t emerge from his photograph.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re proud to be named after Sheldon Jackson because:
<UL>
<LI>
Graduate of Princeton Seminary</LI>
<LI>
Became a Presbyterian missionary and oversaw church work in the western
US</LI>
<LI>
Traveled 30,000 miles/year (in the mid-1800s!), raising thousands of dollars
for schools (31) and churches (350!)</LI>

<LI>
Collected Native art throughout his travels because, as he wrote a friend,
"...in a few years there would be nothing left to show the coming generations
of natives how their fathers lived."</LI>

<LI>
A close friend of President Benjamin Harrison</LI>

<LI>
First General Agent of Education in Alaska</LI>

<LI>
Made 33 trips to Siberia, importing nearly 1300 reindeer for Alaskan Eskimos</LI>

<LI>
By his death at age 75, had made 26 trips to Alaska</LI>

<LI>
Short on height (5'2") but clearly long on energy and faith</LI>

. . . is a Sitka Spruce. These majestic trees grow to 150 feet and are
ideal for aircraft, sailboat masts, and violins because they are the strongest
yet lightest of all trees. Howard Hughes’ famous Spruce Goose was built
of Sitka Spruce. The young, green spruce tips are very high in vitamin
C, so the Russians who inhabited Baranof Island in the early 1800s used
them in their beer because it healed scurvy. Sitka Spruce comprise 20%
of Southeast Alaska’s Tongass National Forest: the largest forest in North
America and the largest remaining temperate rain forest in the world <I>(16.8
million acres!)</I>.

&nbsp;. . .of Sitka Sound--warmed by the warm Japanese currents of the
Pacific Ocean--are some of the richest in the world: home to <I>five</I>
species of salmon, halibut, sea lions, otters, herring, killer whales <I>(orcas),</I>
and--most abundant of all--humpback whales. SJ’s historic campus sits on
the Green overlooking Crescent Bay on the Sound, so we see this proliferation
of sea creatures daily, along with the eagles and herons and other bird
life which depend also on the sea.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The fish . . .</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="fish.JPG" HEIGHT=186 WIDTH=200></CENTER>
. . . symbolizes Sheldon Jackson College in two ways:
<OL>
<LI>
The one in the graphic is the pink (<I>or humpy</I>) salmon.*&nbsp; SJ
is a leader in aquatic education--for obvious reasons: both fresh
water and salt water within five minutes of campus! We have the <B><I>only
production salmon hatchery on a campus in the US</I>,</B> raising four
species of salmon: Coho, Chum, Pink, and King. These salmon are spawned
in fresh water and released as fry into salt water where they spend two-to-seven
years, swimming <I>thousands</I> of miles. As they mature, the salmon return
to the <B>exact same hatchery</B> or stream from which they were hatched
years before! You can see them leaping for joy as they return home to Sitka
Sound each August.</LI>

<LI>The fish is also the traditional symbol of <B>Christianity</B>.&nbsp; Sheldon
Jackson himself was a Presbyterian missionary and the College is still
related to the Presbyterian Church (USA).&nbsp; Scores of volunteers help
the faculty and administration serve students, and most of these come through
the Presbyterian Church.&nbsp; <B>Spiritual</B> -- as well as intellectual and environmental
-- growth continues to be encouraged at SJC and is a principle in our Mission.</LI>
</OL>

among SJ students is the <I>"Fighting Humpy"</I>!

&nbsp;. . .that protect Sitka appear to jump right out of the ocean. Each
mountain on SJ’s home island <I>(Baranof) </I>has its own name and is not
part of a specific range. Some of the mountains near Sitka include:
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B><I>Mt. Edgecumbe</I></B>. Dormant for 10,000 years, this 3200-foot volcano
reminds many of Japan’s Mount Fuji. In 1972, a local prankster helicoptered
70 tires to Edgecumbe, deposited them in the volcano’s cone, and set them
on fire. When Sitkans arose on April 1, the smoke emerging from Edgecumbe
convinced many that the volcano was erupting again. Those who investigated
the eruption found "April Fool" stamped in the snow beside the tires!*</LI>

<LI>
<B><I>Verstovia</I>. </B>Probably the toughest trail among the many around
Sitka, Verstovia’s elevation is about 3500 feet. It was named by the Russians
because a Russian "verst" is 3500 feet.</LI>

<LI>
<B><I>Anahootz</I> and <I>Katlian</I>. </B>Both named for Tlingit leaders,
Katlian was a warrior who led his people in their rebellions against the
early Russians.</LI>
