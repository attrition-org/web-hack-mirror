<h2><i>Sheldon Jackson was a passionate, robust <b>man</b>:</i></h2>

<ul>

<li>After <i>Princeton</i>, he became a Presbyterian missionary and oversaw church work in the western U.S.</li>

<li>He traveled 30,000 miles/year (<i>in the mid-1800s!</i>), raising thousands of dollars for <i>schools</i> (<i>by 1892, he had started 31 schools!</i>) and churches (<i>350!</i>).</li>

<li>He gathered <i>Native art</i> throughout his travels because, as he wrote a friend, &quot;...<i>in a few years there would be nothing left to show the coming generations of natives how their fathers lived</i>.&quot;</li>

<li>A close friend of President Benjamin Harrison.</li>

<li>First General Agent of Education in Alaska.</li>

<li>Jackson made <b>33 trips to Siberia</b>, importing nearly <i>1300 reindeer</i> for Alaskan Eskimos.</li>

<li>At his death at age 75, he had made 26 trips to Alaska.</li>

<li>Short on height (5'2&quot;) but clearly <b>long on energy and commitment</b>.</li>

</ul>

<h2><i>Sheldon Jackson is a <b>college</b>:</i></h2>

<ul>

<li>SJ was founded as an <i>&quot;industrial and training&quot;</i> school for Tlingit boys in 1878.</li>

<li>John G. Brady was the Presbyterian missionary who established the school.  (He later became <b>Alaska's first Governor)</b>.</li>

<li>The school evolved as Native needs changed: from vocational training into a grade school, then a high school.  In 1944 it became a two-year college open to non-Natives.</li>

<li>We began offering four-year programs in 1976.</li>

<li>Today Sheldon Jackson is <i>fully accredited</i> by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges, <i>authorized</i> to offer courses in Alaska by the state's Postsecondary Commission, and <i>certified</i> by the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education Colleges.</li>
