Sure, we're an accredited college, so we take <b>studying</b> seriously:

<ul>

<li>you must select an academic major</li>

<li>go to class</li>

<li>take tests</li>

<li>adapt to different professors</li>

</ul>

<p>

But at Sheldon Jackson College, <i><b>co</b>-curricular life</i> (life <b>outside</b> the classroom) is also <i>extraordinary</i>:

<ul>

<p>

<li>Because of our <i>extraordinary</i> location.  Are you kidding?! <b>SJ is in Alaska!</b> Students happy at SJ are active and adventurous:

<ul>

<li>hiking through the Tongass National Forest (16.8 <b>million</b> acres! <i>Largest rainforest in North America!</i>)</li>

<li>kayaking in Sitka Sound</li>

<li>whale-, seal-, and sea lion-watching</li>

<li>mountain biking</li>

<li>scuba diving</li>

<li>fishing <i>(deep sea, fly, sport, et al.)</i></li>

<li>camping at a Forest Service cabin accessible only by boat or floatplane</li>

</ul></li>

<p>

<li>Because of our <i>extraordinary</i> athletic center.  For a small college, SJ has a <i>magnificent</i> physical education facility called the Hames Center.  Completed in 1987, it houses:

<ul>

<li>6-lane pool</li>

<li>gymnasium which seats 1000</li>

<li>two racquetball courts</li>

<li>weight room</li>

<li>gymnastics/dance space</li>

<li>classrooms and offices</li>

</ul></li>

<p>

<li>Because of our <i>extraordinary</i> history.  Students happy at SJ appreciate history - which is hard to miss in Sitka:

<ul>

<li>Sitka was the location of the &quot;purchase&quot; of Alaska by the U.S, from the Russians in 1867</li>

<li>Sheldon Jackson College is the oldest school in Alaska, established in 1878</li>

<li>SJ is the namesake of an <i>amazing</i> and <i>spirited</i> Presbyterian minister, e.g.:

<ul>

<li>started <b>at least 30</b> schools - both government and church - all over Alaska</li>

<li>made <b>33 trips to Siberia</b> in order to bring <b>reindeer</b> to the Eskimos of northern Alaska</li>

<li>gathered Alaskan Native art which is now considered the <b>foremost collection in the world</b> and housed in the Sheldon Jackson Museum <i>(on the SJ campus)</i></li>

</ul>

<li>Author <a href="./mich2.htm">James A. Michener</a> resided at SJC while writing his best selling novel, <b>Alaska</b></li>

</ul></li>

<p>

<li>Because of our <i>extraordinary &quot;tossed salad&quot;</i> diversity.  In addition to the traditional mainsteam American culture in Southeast Alaska, at least <b>five</b> other cultures are prominent

<i>(three of which are Alaska Native)</i>:

<ul>

<li>Tlingit</li>

<li>Haida</li>

<li>Tsimshian</li>

<li>Filipino</li>

<li>Russian</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p>

As well, SJ has an <b>Activities Department</b> that is charged with providing safe, educational recreation that

nurtures community.  It works closely with Outdoor Recreation classes, Campus Ministry, and Residence Life.  It supervises a <b>rich breadth</b> of co-curricular activities, such as:<ul>

<li>Bible studies</li>

<li>dances</li>

<li>film festival</li>

<li>intramurals, e.g.:

<ul>

<li>water polo</li>

<li>basketball</li>

<li>soccer</li>

<li>racquetball</li>

<li>chess</li>

<li>frisbee golf</li>

<li>Java Loft coffee house</li>

<li>kayaking club</li>
