<h3><i>	&quot;Sheldon Jackson College is the brain child of a remarkable Presbyterian missionary

 in the last century, who had the foresight to establish here in Sitka a school that has developed 

into a fine four-year college.  The school has already enjoyed a long and lively history, and one of which 

it can be proud.

<p>	&quot;Sheldon Jackson's tradition of service to Native people is highly commendable, but it is fast

 becoming a college with an enrollment that includes students from the Lower 48 attracted to a vivid 

experience in frontier living.  Sheldon Jackson will be a valuable educational experience for many decades to come.&quot;</i>
