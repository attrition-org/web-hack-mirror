       <P>Sheldon Jackson College sits on the western shore of Baranof Island in
southeast Alaska.  Encircled by mountains and nestled between ancient forests
and the Pacific Ocean, Sitka is considered one of the most beautiful seaside
ports in the world. SJ is located within the 17-million acre Tongass National
Forest, the largest temperate rain forest in the world, and the largest
National Forest in North America.  The island-studded waters of Sitka Sound
provide shelter from the Pacific Ocean, and are home to humpback whales, sea
lions, and scores of fish species. Like all coastal towns, Sitka receives much
rainfall per year--which of course contributes to the lush, green beauty here
nearly year-round.  Warmed by the Japanese Current, Sitka's climate is
moderate: cool summers and non-severe winters.<P>
