<H3>Distinctive aspects of the Human Services Emphasis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students may, through their choice of internship sites, choose to
specialize within particular human services foci
<li>Sitka, though a small city, provides an unusual number of
opportunities for internships.  Not only are there several local agencies
dealing with social services to the victims of domestic violence, the
developmentally disabled, substance abusers, and others in need of social
services, but it also is the location of Southeast Alaska Regional Health
Corporation, which provides a large number of social services to the
Natives of Southeast Alaska
<li>  Students interested in becoming
substance abuse counselors may choose an appropriate internship and
augment their education through inservice training and workshops offered
through local agencies; upon graduation, they would then be in the
position of completing most or all of the Alaska certification requirements
for Counselor I
<li>The program will emphasize both the general aspects of human
services and the unique problems faced by Alaskans
</ul>
