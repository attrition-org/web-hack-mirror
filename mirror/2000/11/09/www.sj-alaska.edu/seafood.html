</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sheldon Jackson College Seafood Technology Program is designed to prepare students for immediate employment in the seafood industry as well as to pursue further education in the field of food technology. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Courses have been developed to accommodate industry members by avoiding the two largest fishing seasons, salmon season (June through August) and Pollock A Season (January through March). Classes do not follow the SJC semester format but are held in short one-credit segments of three days, one week or two weeks often using evenings and weekends. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Required courses are relevant industry-wide and were developed using input from industry members. Elective courses will be offered to address the interest of students and needs of industry members. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instructors are chosen for their expertise in the field and include members of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Marine Advisory Program, the seafood processing industry and other universities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Full time students are eligible for financial aid packages. All required courses are also approved for JTPA funding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The program is supported through a grant from Arctic Storm, Inc. and Glacier Seafood. For more information call 907-747-2554 or e-mail <a href="mailto:lbrown@sj-alaska.edu">Liz Brown</a>, the Director of the Seafood Technology Program.</P>
