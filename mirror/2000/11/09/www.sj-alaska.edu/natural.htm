<i>Natural Resource Management and Development</i></h1></center><p>

<h3>Some benefits of studying natural resources at SJ:</h3>

<ul>

<li> Alaska has more publicly managed land <i>(National Parks, Wilderness Areas, Forests, Wildlife Refuges)</i> than any other state in the U.S.</li>

<li>SJ maintains cooperative education agreements with the US Forest Service, the National Park Service, and Alaska Fish &amp; Game.</li>

<li>SJ grads have received <b>preferred hiring status</b> for summer employment and internships.</li>

<li>SJ is committed to <b>experiential/hands-on</b> learning to complement the academic program.</li>

<li>The <b>wilderness setting of the college</b> obviously infuses SJ with curricular and co-curricular opportunities found at almost no other American colleges, e.g.:  labs such as the Pacific Ocean and the Tongass National Forest--largest national forest in the country  <i>(16.8 million acres!)</i>;  kayaking; SCUBA diving; mountain biking; whale-watching; hiking; fishing; camping.</li>

<li>The diversity of SJ students--Native American, Alaska Native, Pacific Rim, Northwestern U.S., Lower 48 generally--sensitizes SJ students to cultural differences.</li></ul>
