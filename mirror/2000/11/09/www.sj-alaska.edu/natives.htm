<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheldon Jackson College was founded for Alaska Natives.</FONT>&nbsp;</B>
The school was founded in 1878, making it the oldest one
in Alaska.&nbsp; Originally led by John Brady (who later became first Governor
of the Alaska Territory and is buried in Sitka), SJ was a vocational school
for Tlingit boys, an elementary school, a high school, a junior college,
and is today -- 120 years later! -- an accredited college offering two-year
and four-year programs in:
<UL>
<li>aquaculture</li>
<li>business</li>
<li>elementary education</li>
<li>fisheries</li>
<li>human services</li>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Serving Alaska Natives is an explicit principle of the
SJC Mission.</FONT></B>&nbsp; We have an active Alaska Native Club which participates with local Native organizations.&nbsp;
Our teachers are sensitive to Native ways of learning.&nbsp; Tutors are
available if you need class help.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>SJC enrolls students from many Alaska Native culture groups.&nbsp;</FONT></B>
Even though Southeast Alaska (where Sitka is located) is home to Tlingit,
Haida, and Tsimshian, SJ enrolls all Alaska Native culture groups.</LI>

example:</FONT></B>
