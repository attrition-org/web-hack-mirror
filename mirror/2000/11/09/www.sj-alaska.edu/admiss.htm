Sheldon Jackson College, by mandate of our Board of Trustees, enjoys an open,

 noncompetitive admission policy.  Generally, everyone with a high school diploma

 <i>(or GED)</i> is admitted to SJC.  However,  SJ is a private college, so will retain the perogative to deny admittance to a student who, in our judgment, would not benefit from an SJ education.

<p>We will need the following documents for the admissions process:

<table BORDER>

<tr>

<th><b>First Year Students</b></th>

<th><b>Transfer Students</b></th>

</tr>

<th><ul>

<li>HS transcript <i>(including verification of HS graduation)</i></li></ul></th>

<th><h5><i>If you have earned <b><u>16</u></b> college credits or more:</i></h5>

<p><ul><li>College transcript/s from each college attended.</li></ul>

<p>							

<h5><i>If you have earned <b><u>less than 16</u></b> college credits:</i></h5>

<p><ul><li>HS transcript <i>(including verification of HS graduation)</i></li>

<p>

<li>College transcript/s from each college attended</li></ul></th></tr>

<h4><b>Important admittance notes:</b></h5>

<ul>

<li>Sheldon Jackson does <b>not</b> require a <b><i>standardized test score</i></b> (ACT, SAT)

 for admittance.</li>

<li>Students may enroll in SJ's helpful <b>Achievement Program</b>, which gives students <b>personalized attention</b> and can <b>enhance

 academic success</b> to participants. Details of this Program are available from the

 Learning Center Coordinator <i>(800) 478-4556</i>.</li>

<li>Students whose GPAs <i>(HS or college)</i> are less than 2.0 are required to participate

 in the Achievement Program in order to be fully admitted.</li>

<li>Transfer students who have already earned an associate degree will not have to take SJ's gen ed core (except a religion course).</li></ul>
