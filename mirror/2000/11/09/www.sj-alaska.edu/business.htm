<p><h3>Some benefits of studying business at SJ:</h3><p><ul>

<li>The <b>wilderness setting of the college</b> offers a unique perspective on business study:  students are taught <b>environmentally responsible</b> business practices.</li>

<li>The ethnic diversity of SJ students--Native American, Alaska Native, Pacific Rim, Northwestern U.S., Lower 48 generally--sensitizes SJ students to cultural business differences.</li>

<li>The business program at SJ is <b>non-traditional</b>, i.e., the atmosphere is collaborative not competitive;  faculty are bright yet caring;  classes are small so personal attention is the norm.</li>

<li>Senior <b>internships</b> are offered with corporations, governments, small businesses, and non-profit organizations.</li>

<li>Global, environmental, cultural, ethical, and transnational trends are integrated into the SJ business curriculum.</li></ul>
