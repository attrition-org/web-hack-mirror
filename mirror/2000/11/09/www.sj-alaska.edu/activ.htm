<p><b><i>Mission</i></b> </p>

<p>The mission of the activities department of Sheldon Jackson
College is to provide, safe, educational and fun programs to
develop community and unity on campus within the mission
statement of Sheldon Jackson College. The activities department
works closely with outdoor recreation classes, campus ministry
and the Office of Residence Life to provide a well rounded array
of things to do both indoors and outdoors.</p>

<p>Participation in campus activities is always fully encouraged
and any suggestions students have are taken seriously and
frequently result in new activities. The education which students
receive in both academics and activities at Sheldon Jackson
College will prepare them for the adventure of a lifetime. </p>

of three primary components: outdoor recreation, intramural
sports, and social\educational programs. Typically, the following
