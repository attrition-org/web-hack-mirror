<br>cheers!
<br>
<br>All I wanted was a lousy letter or a call.
<br>I hope you know I ripped all of your files off the wall.
<br>You loved your comp ,the files could have been together. Think about it.
<br>I ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
<br>And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.
<br>I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.
<br>See Admin,'Cause if he suffocates, he'll suffer more, and then he'll die too.
<br>Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the deep end now.
