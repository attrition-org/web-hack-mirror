      <br>
      It takes a lot to know what is love<br>
      It's not the big thing but the little things <br>
      That can mean enough<br>
      A lot of players to get me through<br>
      There is never a day that passes by <br>
      I don't think of you<br>
      You were always there for me <br>
      Pushing me and guiding me<br>
      Always to succeed<br>
      <br>
      You showed me<br>
      When i was young just how to grow <br>
      You showed me everything that i should know <br>
      You showed me just how to walk without your hands <br>
      'Cause mom you always were the perfect fan<br>
      <br>
      God has been so good <br>
      With blessing me with the family<br>
      Who did all they could<br>
      And I've had many years of Grace<br>
      And it flatters me when i see a smile on your face<br>
      I wanna thank you for what you've done<br>
      In hopes I can give back to you <br>
      And be the perfect son<br>
      <br>
      You showed me<br>
      When i was young just how to grow <br>
      You showed me everything that i should know <br>
      You showed me just how to walk without your hands <br>
      'Cause mom you always were the perfect fan<br>
      <br>
      You showed me how to love<br>
      You showed me how to care<br>
      And showed me that you would always be there<br>
      I wanna thank you for the time<br>
      And i'm proud to say you're mine<br>
      <br>
      You showed me<br>
      When i was young just how to grow <br>
      You showed me everything that i should know <br>
      You showed me just how to walk without your hands <br>
      'Cause mom you always were the perfect fan</font> <!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
