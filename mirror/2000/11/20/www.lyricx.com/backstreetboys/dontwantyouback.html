</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">(Don't, Don't want you back)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You hit me faster than a shark attack&nbsp;<br>
You saw my picture on the "Backstreet's Back" alright&nbsp;<br>
And you were more than just a pretty face&nbsp;<br>
And how you fooled me im still amazed, babe&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But I should have known that I would be&nbsp;<br>
Another victim of your sexuality&nbsp;<br>
But now we're done and over with (ha ha, ha)&nbsp;<br>
(don't, don't want you back)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't you back&nbsp;<br>
Cuz your no good for me, I know&nbsp;<br>
That's all I can say&nbsp;<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
Forgive my honesty&nbsp;<br>
But ya gotta go&nbsp;<br>
I, I dont want you back&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You started going out wit' so called friends&nbsp;<br>
But i was blinded, so I lost all common sense&nbsp;<br>
But there were things that made me realize (realize)&nbsp;<br>
Like all one hundred, no- thousand lies&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
Cuz your no good for me, I know&nbsp;<br>
That's all I can say&nbsp;<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
Forgive my honesty&nbsp;<br>
But ya gotta go (yea-heah)&nbsp;<br>
I, I don't you back-no&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I, I dont want you back&nbsp;<br>
(that's right)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Baby, don't bother tellin' me your reasons why&nbsp;<br>
Just let us sing this story, bout' you and I&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
That's all I know,&nbsp;<br>
-Don't want cha back- don't want cha back-&nbsp;<br>
All I can say&nbsp;<br>
Don't want you back, you know ya gotta go&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't you back&nbsp;<br>
Cuz your no good for me, I know (Don't want cha back)&nbsp;<br>
That's all I can say&nbsp;<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
Forgive my honesty&nbsp;<br>
But ya gotta go (got to go)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I, I dont want you back-&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
That's all I know&nbsp;<br>
That's all I can say&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
Don't want you back&nbsp;<br>
You know you gotta go&nbsp;<br>
I, I don't want you back</font>
