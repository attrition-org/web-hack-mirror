      Boys - As Long As You Love Me</font></strong><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      Although loneliness has always been <br>
      A friend of mine <br>
      I'm leaving my life in your hands <br>
      People say I'm crazy and that I am blind <br>
      Risking it all in a glance <br>
      How you got me blind is still a mystery <br>
      I can't get you out of my head <br>
      Don't care what is written in your history <br>
      As long as you're here with me <br>
      <br>
      I don't care who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      What you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      Who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      Don't care what you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      Every little thing that you have said and done <br>
      Feels like it's deep within me <br>
      Doesn't really matter if you're on the run <br>
      It seems like we're meant to be <br>
      <br>
      I don't care who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      What you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      Who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      Don't care what you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      I've tried to hide it so that no one knows <br>
      But I guess it shows <br>
      When you look into my eyes <br>
      What you did and where you're coming from <br>
      I don't care, as long as you love me, baby <br>
      <br>
      I don't care who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      What you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      Who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      Don't care what you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      Who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      What you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      Who you are <br>
      Where you're from <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      Who you are <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      What you did <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      I don't care <br>
      As long as you love me <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      'Cause Mom you always were, Mom you always were<br>
      Mom you always were...the perfect fan<br>
