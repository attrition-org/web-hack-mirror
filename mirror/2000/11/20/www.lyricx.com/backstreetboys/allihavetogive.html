      I don't know what he does <br>
      To make you cry <br>
      But I'll be there to make you smile <br>
      I don't have a fancy car <br>
      To get to you <br>
      I'd walk a thousand miles <br>
      <br>
      I don't care if he buys you nice things <br>
      Does his gifts come from the heart <br>
      I don't know <br>
      But if you were my girl <br>
      I'd make it so we'd never be apart <br>
      <br>
      But my love is all I have to give <br>
      Without you I don't think I can live <br>
      I wish I could give the world to you <br>
      But love is all I have to give <br>
      <br>
      When you talk (when you talk) <br>
      Does it seem like he's not <br>
      Even listening to a word you say? <br>
      That's okay babe <br>
      Just tell me your problems <br>
      I'll try my best to kiss them all away <br>
      <br>
      Does he leave <br>
      When you need him the most <br>
      Does his friends get all your time? <br>
      Baby please <br>
      I'm on my knees <br>
      Praying for the day <br>
      That you'll be mine <br>
      <br>
      But my love is all I have to give <br>
      Without you I don't think I can live <br>
      I wish I could give the world to you <br>
      But love is all I have to give <br>
      Oh, to you <br>
      <br>
      Hey girl (hey girl) <br>
      I don't want you to cry no more - inside, oh oh <br>
      All the money in the world <br>
      Could never add up to all the love <br>
      I have inside <br>
      I love you, baby <br>
      <br>
      And I will give it to you <br>
      All I can give, all I can give <br>
      (All, all, all, all, all) <br>
      Everything I have is for you <br>
      (You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you) <br>

      (I wanna give the world to you) <br>
      <br>
      But love is all I have to give <br>
      (It's all that I have) <br>
