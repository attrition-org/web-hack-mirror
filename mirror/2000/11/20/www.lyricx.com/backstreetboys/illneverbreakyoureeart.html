      Boys - I'll Never Break Your Heart</font></strong><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      Baby, I know you're hurting <br>
      Right now you feel like you could never love again <br>
      Now all I ask is for a chance <br>
      To prove that I love you <br>
      <br>
      From the first day <br>
      That I saw your smiling face <br>
      Honey, I knew that we would be together forever <br>
      Ooh, when I asked you out <br>
      You know said no, but I found out <br>
      Darling that you'd been hurt <br>
      You felt that you'd never love again <br>
      I deserve a try honey just once <br>
      Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong <br>
      You walked in you were so quick to judge <br>
      But honey he's nothing like me <br>
      <br>
      I'll never break your heart <br>
      I'll never make you cry <br>
      I'd rather die, than live without you <br>
      I'll give you all of me <br>
      Honey, that's no lie <br>
      I'll never break your heart <br>
      I'll never make you cry <br>
      I'd rather die, than live without you <br>
      I'll give you all of me <br>
      Honey, that's no lie <br>
      <br>
      As time goes by <br>
      You will get to know me <br>
      A little more better <br>
      Girl that's the way love goes (baby, baby) <br>
      And I know you're afraid <br>
      To let your feelings show <br>
      And I understand <br>
      But girl it's time to let go <br>
      I deserve a try honey <br>
      Just once <br>
      Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong <br>
      You walked in you were so quick to judge <br>
      But honey he's nothing like me <br>
      Darling why can't you see <br>
      <br>
      I'll never break your heart <br>
      I'll never make you cry <br>
      I'd rather die, than live without you <br>
      I'll give you all of me <br>
      Honey, that's no lie <br>
      I'll never break your heart <br>
      I'll never make you cry <br>
      I'd rather die, than live without you <br>
      I'll give you all of me <br>
      Honey, that's no lie <br>
      <br>
      No way, no how <br>
      I'll make you cry <br>
      No way, no how <br>
      I'll make you cry <br>
      <br>
      I'll never break your heart <br>
      I'll never make you cry <br>
      I'd rather die, than live without you <br>
