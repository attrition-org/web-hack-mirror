If some had their way, they would manifest themselves in every society as if
they were the only one and true option. This makes me sick, I despise people
who try and force their beliefs onto others. Frankly I am agnostic, in the
society which we live we're all bound to goto hell, or your religion's
equivilent. So why should I even care how I base my choices in life for a
intangible prize in the bottom of my 'cereal box'. Something tells me it's
just another Pikachu top that requires you spend 24.95$ for it's patented
top launcher. I'd rather live my life for personal pleasure and gain, when I
die I'll be gone.

With that said and done I would like to extend salutations to the following
people and groups:
<br>
#rsh on dugnet, I don't go there much, but you're all down with ka0x so
you're cool with me.
<br>
<p>
Everyone else in Telconinjas, we may be just a gay group of asian children,
but you guys are like brothers to me and I appreciate you being there to
listen to my endless nagging and to support me in everything I do... most of
the time. ;x
<br>
<p>
Special shouts to Fone: We bout it bout it to smoke some reefer come April.
<br><p>
Amy: If your grandfather or father arrest me, I kill you. But hi and
*hugs. Your never ending collection of gay music will always put mine to
shame.
<br><p>
Assorted others: Ravagrrl, ka0x, skrilla, feared, iceman, dinkee,
Morbie, weev, optx, blackout_.
<br><p> Children, don't forget me, I shall return soon.
