Well what have I found here?  A new root?  Wow Linux RedHat.  Admin you're so elite it took me hours! j/k  This hack to about 45 minutes...that's pathetic...I got it on my doze box too!  LAME!  Seriously take a look into your security...I think the previous hack of this site, Slacker, may have installed a backdoor so look for that too.  I patched the method I used to get in and your index.html was renamed to index.bak  I'm so serious about your security problems also...if you need any help just e-mail me, <a href=mailto:neonfx@hushmail.com>neonfx@hushmail.com</a>.

Ok, I am not Neon-Lenz and I did not take his name nor did he take mine.  I was using this nick before I knew who he existed I'm sure the same applies for him.  So don't flame me for it because I'm not changing for anyone!  I'm back and I'm never gonna get under that kind of situation.  Hell I got a girl out of it.  Her name is Kristen, how do you like her?  =D
