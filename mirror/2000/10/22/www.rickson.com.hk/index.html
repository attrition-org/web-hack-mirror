<br>Heh, look at sammy! He's pointing to you!
<p>That's right ladies and gents, hackweiser has taken <u>your</u> system
for the sexy hacker movement known as</center>

GLOBAL DOMINATION</h1></center>

<center>bahahah! You know who it is.
<br>b33rcan is having fun in his magical adventures in .hk cyberspace!
<br>Yeah, um hong kong your <b>owned worse then a two dollar hooker</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Admin: index is backed, sploit is patched up
<p>And another note, you did a fucking good job of securing it. For real,
you have a firewall and everything.
<br>Just make sure <u>all</u> of your servers are secured =).
<br>That's right kids, I owned this by mapping out the server and taking
the weakest part.
<br>Like some dood said "your only as strong as your weakest link".
<br>well, thats mostly all from me.
<br>But my man p4ntera has a few things to say, p4ntera, its all yours:
<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">I would just like to comment on a few "happenings"
in the underground lately, more specifically, on my old group, ph33r the
b33r.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">let me fill you in.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">They are trying to make a "come back". How? By
defacing?</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">No.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">That's right! lol, the very thought.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">A group, made on the foundation of defacing,
and brought up by a motivated hacker (me), believe they can start over
again.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">And check this:</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">They think they can do this without me.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">Funny thing is, where this group used to have
immense skill, they seemingly lack in anything but stupidity.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">A dood by the named of "idi0" emailed b33rcan
@ hackweiser's account with a log of script0r (the supposed new leader
of this "new reformed ptb") showing his many, many hates towards me and
his real idea of what ptb will end up like.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">Where does this hate come from? I am personally
guessing he is <b>jealous</b> in what I have accomplished in a few months,
something he couldn't accomplish in most of his life.</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">here is just some of his <b>very wrong and 
mis-informed</b>
statements:</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-2>( my comments in bold and 
yellow)</font></font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* we didn't aprecieate
him draging this whole group into shit on his</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>&nbsp; defacements, he always tried
to speak for the whole group</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* but never realy cared
what teh rest of the group was about</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Now this makes me laugh. He
believes that a man who made, founded and worked his fucking ass off for
the group didn't know what it was about.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>I made the group to show that
the hacking scene wasn't dead with the many recent ('99) arrests, and that
skillfull hackers still exist.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Yet, what does he think it is?
The hole gets deeper....</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* after we ditched all
the defacers, and just staarted on real</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>&nbsp; security stuff, there realy
wasn't any need for a leader</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Okie dokie, so you "ditched"
the defacers. So you pretty much "ditched" the group, didn't you. Because
the defacers were the only ones actually doing anything, you 
dumbass.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>So what should we expect, made
idling fearage? fear.</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* A few consider me a leader,
but certinaly wouldn't take the credit</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* I know, that's why we
don't apreciate om3g4's "publicity"</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>First of all, he seeminly draws
the conclusion that I am "Om3g4", whoever that may be. Wrong 
#1.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Wrong #2, hey script0r! I thought
you weren't a leader, then why do you "speak" for the group. Unless your
a sczo, thats a fault on your behalf =)</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* but I was concerned that
he was a danger everyone else by his defacing</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* he was a danger to us
all</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* not only was he defacing
all the time</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Danger? fool, you knew what
you were getting into the second I asked you to join.</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>script0r* well he was just a danger
to all of us</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* his defacing got us
attention that we didn't care for</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Once again, you knew what you
were getting into. If not, you could have simply just left, but nooo...
you would rather annoy me to the point that I have to take my spare time
to put a few comments on a defaced page, to show the world what kind of
idiot/backstabber you are.</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>-> *script0r* i like message to
be get by others though => &lt;<b> idi0's msg</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* there's so much better
things to do with computer talent</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* and once you do, it's
kinda like your blacklisted from the rest of</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>&nbsp; the comunity</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* lol your messeasge to
be gotten by others?</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* write a letter 
:P</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* make a real Web 
site</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* more people will read
it anyway</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Yey, so you get "black listed".
You idiot, there are skillfull defacers, and there aren't. There are also
skillfull coders, and there also isn't. It's like that for anything. So
what should he care if he gets black listed? Its a <u>underground</u>,
the point of calling it a underground is to make it the opposite of order,
NO RULES.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Next.... You say "write a letter"
etc. Are you retarded? No one gives a fuck what you think, until you tread
upon their terroritory. Also, you give the admin some free security advice
and maybe warn him before something bad happens...</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* everyone hs their own
veiwpoint</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* but their own veiw is
not necesarily the groups own view</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>So if everyone has their own
viewpoint, why you saying I can't preach mine? Hmmm?</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>As well... if someone makes
a group, and then tells people ahead of time what they are joining, its
not the groups view? Err... lol.</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>-> *script0r* how many friends do
pantera have in ph33r-the-b33r?</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* did?</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* or now?</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* none really</font></font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=-1>*script0r* the only ones who still
come around are prety fed up with his shit</font></font>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>I am just gonna stop here, I
got lots more I could comment on, but Im tired and b33rcan is rushing me
to put this up =D</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Script0r.. if your so fed up
with my shit, then bring it to my fucking face. Stop talking shit behind
my back.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>And for the rest of you clowns.
I don't fear you, niether does hackweiser or anyone for that 
matter.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>I don't give a fuck if you are
my friends or not, hell if I was friends with you, I would feel sorry for
me.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>I would rather have 1 good friend
then 10 fuckup friends who backstab each other the second some dood brings
up a stupid ideal in a group.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>You fed of my shit? You like
to talk shit? SAY IT TO MY FACE. I can handle it, I am a big boy now (so
says my mommy).</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Ok? Now if you got anything
else to say, maybe you can post it on some webpage.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>WAIT A SEC, YOU AREN'T ALLOWED
TO DEFACE.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>What you gonna do? Write a webpage
about me? Oh noo fear =(</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Too bad, i guess you won't get
your viewpoint across.</font></font></b>
