<p><b><font color="#FF0000">China and Taiwan</font></b>
<br>First of all i want to clear up a few things, i am neither FOR, nor
AGAINST China or Taiwan. My purpose was to keep the peace between those
2 countries. There are already enough innocent people killed. I just want
China to stop forcing Taiwan to give their country back, since the Taiwanese
people are happy with the way it is now. Also Government of China, why
would you attack Taiwan, they are your own people remember ! But since
China is a communistic country already tells you that they're difficult
to handle with, so you actually can't expect them to give up. If that is
the case then there is no other solution than to have Taiwan to surrender,
it's their only hope to prevent any more killings.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Politicians</font></b>
<br>I think another important thing is that the politicians don't really
realize that innocent people get killed for nothing. But, what if that
happens to the politicians' family ? You should realize what the feelings
are of others and try to sense how it would be if it happens to you. And
not only about yourself, your power and your money. If you really want
that, then put the politicians in a ring and let them kill each other there.&nbsp;
Just try not to get innocent people involved in all this which they don't
even care about if they are living in Taiwan or China, all they want is
<b><u>peace</u></b>...
