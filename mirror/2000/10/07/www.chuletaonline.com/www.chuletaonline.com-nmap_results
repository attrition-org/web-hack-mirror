Interesting ports on  (200.11.216.24):
Port       State       Service
22/tcp     filtered    ssh                     
23/tcp     filtered    telnet

Aggressive OS guesses: Linux 2.1.122 - 2.2.16 (85%), Linux kernel 2.2.13 (85%), Linux 2.2.14 (85%)
No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see http://www.insecure.org/cgi-bin/nmap-submit.cgi).
