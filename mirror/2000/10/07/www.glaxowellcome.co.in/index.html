        defacement explains what ISI means to a Indian official and how they promote 
        the hate for Pakistani's by using the name of ISI (Pakistan's security 
        agency) Indians (media/government) You are pathetic!</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This is a funny defacement, a MUST read </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
        their current "anti Pakistan and their agencies" hysteria of the Indian 
        media they want you to believe that every aspect of their life is infiltrated 
        by ISI. Having thought about it carefully I came to the conclusion that 
        yes maybe they are right. The following is an example of how an ordinary 
        Indian's day is disrupted by ISI: -</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He 
        wakes up early in the morning and stumbles across the room to watch the 
        sun rise, but there are clouds in the sky blocking his view. Obviously 
        ISI are the culprits as they want him to feel depressed, so they sent 
        clouds over India at sun rise. - He than makes his way to the bathroom 
        and starts shaving. What's this, his face gets cut by the blade. Surely 
        ISI must have planted a rogue blade in his bathroom in order to make his 
        life miserable early in the morning. - Having survived two assaults by 
        this terrorist organisation he leaves for work and asks his wife to lock 
        all the doors and baricade herself in the house just in case there is 
        an ISI agent around who might sneak into the house and sabotage it. - 
        He than discovers another nefarious plot by the notorious ISI ---</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> all 
        the public transport whether they be buses or trains are overflowing with 
        commuters. Obviously these commuters are ISI plants to stop him from getting 
        to his workplace and contributing to the welfare of his country. - He 
        reaches his workplace after a great effort and discovers that ISI has 
        struck again. There is no elctricity and therfore he cannot carry out 
        his duties. Another clever plot by ISI to sabotage his great nation. - 
        He staggers to lunch during the afternoon but feels drowsy after the meal. 
        Wants to sleep instead of work. What did the ISI put in his food? - On 
        the way back he discovers that the commuter conspiracy is again at work. 
        - Finally he arrives home, his children give him their school report. 
        What, they are not doing well at school. Realises that ISI has infiltrated 
        the education system as well and now are out to destroy the education 
        of the children by sending such reports to parents. - Night falls, he 
        goes to bed, hears a thump outside his bedroom, looks out of the bedroom 
        window ----- ISI ----- life goes on. </font></p>
