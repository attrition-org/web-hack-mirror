<h1>The Old Web Mail System has been removed from service.</h1>

<h3>As noted at the end of the last school year. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may access your mail at <a href="http://www.pcs.k12.va.us/mail">http://www.pcs.k12.va.us/mail</a></p>

<p>Mail Gear is the only system available at this time.&nbsp; We may be able to bring Web
Mail back as a way to access mail other than that through Pittsylvania County Schools
systems.</p>
