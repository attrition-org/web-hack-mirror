<p>Guess what ? You've been hacked by Neon-Lenz. Don't worry about it,
you won't get fired.
<br>Well at least i guess not, if you take security seriously from now
on. I'm kind of tired giving the
<br>the same hints everytime. Admin, just take a look at the file called
"secureyourself.txt"
<br>in your <b>%systemroot%\system32</b>. You'll find some hints of mine
there. Nothing was deleted
<br>or damaged, except for the logs of course. So Admin, sleep tight, everything
will be just fine.

<p><b>Screw y(ew)</b> to the Hitler Crew !
<p>I wanna say hi to my <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~orgcrime/chiindex.htm">Asian</a> homies,
let's chop those Hitler Crew bastards.
<br>AzN Forever!
<p><b>Greets to:</b>
<br>Trib(unal), Herbless, Fux0r (got your e-mail!), ScorpionKTX, Ne[r0,

<br>attrition, alldas, haxordot, Nohican/{} and all the other Hackers from
Holland. De Groeten !
<p>Argh i've just coded a lame little tool called PcAnyScan, it scans for
the PcAnyWhere ports
<br>using the NetCat executable (nc.exe). Why ? Because it saves you a
lot of typing and a lot
<br>of time waiting till the darn portscanner reaches the 65301th port.
(since the major difference
<br>of the various PcAnyWhere ports are like this: 22 and 65301, and few
others not listed here).
<p>Download <a href="http://npcdh.hypermart.net/Pcanyscan.exe">Pcanyscan.exe</a>
<br>Download <a href="http://npcdh.hypermart.net/nc.exe">nc.exe</a> (NetCat
Executable)
<p>Note: Pcanyscan.exe and the nc.exe must be located in the same directory,
otherwise
<br>it will NOT work. (I know you know damnit, just for the newbies). 8)</center>
