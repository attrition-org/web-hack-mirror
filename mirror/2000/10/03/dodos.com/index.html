<br><b><i><font size=-1>&nbsp;Guess who is in your MicroSnot Eye Eye Ass
Server ? :)</font></i></b></center>

<p><b>Admin</b>: send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">neonlenz@hushmail.com</a>
if you want to have more info about the vulnerability and the fix. Till
then, close NetBIOS over TCP/IP (common error, what do they teach you guys
for MSCE+I ?). Set a password on the "sa" account of your SQL server. And
remove all samples in your public directory. Btw, i haven't deleted anything,
only the logs.
<p><b>"My" Thoughts on....</b>
<br><b>C</b>arnivore is stupid, <b>C</b>arnivore is lame, <b>C</b>arnivore
abuses its power by co-operating with ISP's. <b>C</b>arnivore itself is
nothing special at all. It's just some stupid sniffer-a-like program acting
to be like some SUPER tool trying to gain the media's attention.
<br>Heh, better encryption in the future will make the feds <a href="http://www.deejay.com">scratch</a>
on their heads 8)
<p><b>"How to Hack" E-mails..</b>
<br>Please don't bother me with "How to Hack" e-mails, NO, i will not teach
you how to deface websites or to steal credit cards. E-mails like those
will not be read and deleted without a reply, period! Also, e-mails from
"fake" admins of this website will not be read either. At least, try to
send it from this domain (<b>@dodos.com</b>) or prove by adding .html to
this website.
<p><b>Who the hell defaced "taoster.raremedium.com" ?</b>
<br>For crying out loud, if you want to deface, deface on your own damn
alias or
<br>with no alias at all, using my alias won't get you anywhere! (well
maybe you get flamed).
<br>You've made me feel so "<a href="http://www.hentai.com">sexy</a> and
<a href="http://www.fbi.gov">wanted</a>" now, you don't want that, i'm
sure. ;p
<p><b>Greets to:</b>
<br>Tribunal, Herbless, Fux0r, ScorpionKTX, Ne[r0, u4ia, Social Outcast,
TeQKay, F0kus, Zyvr, electr0n (we're ok bud), Rhino9,G-Force Pakistan,
m0r0n and nightman (peace), nexus (welcome back bud, nice one),
<br>stealth-fone of the TelcoNinjas (for putting a "yummy yummy" pic on
their tripos.com hack), attrition, alldas and
<br>haxordot (new mirror for hacked websites, nice one), Nohican, {} and
all the other Dutch Hackers. Damn too bad
<br>that Gerrie showed us nothing.. nasdaq, wim kok, voetbal.nl ? Nah,
the only thing we could see was the
<br>SQL enterprise manager window on his win2k box. Better luck next time
