<b>The reason behind this defacement is because I want to preach about the police.  Well, I picked up my newspaper today and I started reading it (yes, I can read now).  One article intrigues my mind though. It's about the police.  It says 'man was shot to death by police while his wife was handcuffed in another room during a drug raid on the wrong house.'  What the fuck is up with that?? I thought it was supposed to be difficult for police to get a search warrant, how the hell do they get a warrant for the wrong home? They said 'Police admitted their mistake, saying faulty information from a drug informant contributed to the death of ....'  LOL! If I called in and said that the bitch that lives next door is a druggy and has lots of drugs in her home, would the police go over there and kill her?? I wish! But that's fucked up how they can obtain a search warrant with faulty information.  That's fucked up. I KNOW that this isn't the first time something like this has happened. I've heard about it before, and the police don't even appologize. What a bunch of assholes. They probably haven't even appologized about this incident. I just think it's really fucked up how the police can get a search warrant against someone who doesn't even have a parking ticket. So..Fuck the cops, fuck the feds, and fuck all the assholes.<br><br><br><center>Happy Birthday fuqrag</center><br><br>
