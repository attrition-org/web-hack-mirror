      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        the world waits to see the conclusion of the Indian airline hijacking, 
        serious questions are raised about the whole saga. Information from Kashmir 
        indicates that no Kashmiri group is involved in the hijacking of the Indian 
        airline plane. Furthermore, it has emerged that the involvement and demanded 
        release of a key figure (Maulana Masood Azhar, in an Indian jail since 
        1994) indicates that this may be an Indian intelligence game being played 
        to discredit the Kashmiri Freedom struggle. It comes as no surprise that 
        during the Al-Faran saga and the kidnapping of Westerners, who are still 
        missing, the release of the above figure was demanded.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No 
        information about Al-Faran has been realised to date and the be-heading 
        of the Norwegian hostage leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Was the 
        Norwegian really killed by Al-Faran? Did he really exist and was he kidnapped 
        at all? Only time will tell. Is Indian RAW Agent S.B.S. Tomar Behind the 
        Hijacking Drama? Names of Passengers and Crew on Board Hijacked Indian 
        Airlines Plane By Syed Adeeb WASHINGTON, DC, USA, December 28, 1999 (Information 
        Times): Pakistan Television (PTV) and Pakistan's Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
        Tariq Altaf have disclosed that S.B.S. Tomar, an agent of India's infamous 
        intelligence agency, Research & Analysis Wing (RAW), is also on board 
        the hijacked Indian Airlines plane and he is guiding, directing and controlling 
        the five or six hijackers. PTV reported on Tuesday, December 28, 1999 
        that "According to sources, the RAW agent aboard the hijacked plane is 
        S.B.S. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tomar 
        who is holding the cover post of First Secretary in the Indian Embassy 
        in Kathmandu, Nepal. According to information, this very RAW agent is 
        controlling the entire operation from inside the plane." "I have just 
        now been told by a reliable source that an Indian RAW agent is on board 
        the aircraft," Pakistan's Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf told reporters 
        during a news briefing held on Monday, December 27, 1999 in Islamabad. 
        Later, Tariq Altaf told journalists that the name of the Indian RAW spy 
        is: "S.B.S. Tomar." S.B.S. Tomar, the name of the Indian RAW agent, is 
        definitely on the list of the names of passengers and crew on board hijacked 
        Indian Airlines Flight No. IC-814, which was scheduled to fly from Kathmandu, 
        Nepal to New Delhi, India. Indian Airlines flight schedule from Kathmandu 
        to New Delhi for Friday, December 24, 1999 was as follows: Flight No. 
        IC 814 (Airbus 300) Departs Kathmandu at 1350, Arrives in New Delhi at 
        1510 - (Non-Stop Daily Flight - 7 Days a Week) - J-Class Fare = $170, 
        Y-Class Fare = $142.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Indian 
        Airlines Flight IC-814 was hijacked from Indian airspace on Friday, December 
        24, 1999 and taken to Lahore, Pakistan (permission to land not granted); 
        Amritsar, India (First Stop); Lahore, Pakistan (Second Stop); Afghanistan 
        (permission to land not granted); Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Third Stop); 
        and Kandahar, Afghanistan (Fourth Stop), where Indian negotiators tried 
        to cut a deal with the hijackers. Indian Airlines official logo reads: 
        "a perfect take-off". Following is the name list of Indian Airlines Flight 
        IC-814, which includes 178 passengers, including five infants, and 11 
        crew members (For some reason, the name of Mr. S. Kumar appears twice 
        in the Indian Airlines Flight IC-814 list of passengers and crew)</font><font color="#00FFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:
