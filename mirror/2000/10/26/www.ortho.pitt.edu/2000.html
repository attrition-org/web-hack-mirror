The MSRC has laboratories located in the 16th Floor of the Biomedical     Science Tower (the <b>Bioengineering and Tissue Engineering Laboratories</b>     under the direction of Dr. Savio Woo), in Presbyterian University Hospital     (the <b>Ferguson Laboratory</b> under the direction of Drs. James Kang and     Raj Sinha), in Rangos Research Center (<b>the Growth and Development Laboratory</b>     under the direction of Dr. Johnny Huard), and in Trees Hall (<b>the Neuromuscular     Laboratory</b> under the direction of Dr. Scott Lephart). The diversified     interests of the principal investigators, as well as collaborations between     them, enable us to pursue a multidisciplinary approach to orthopaedic disease     oriented and clinically relevant research. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This past year was both     exciting and successful for the MSRC, as we hosted a national conference,     welcomed new personnel, and applauded the recipients of several national and     international awards. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most exciting     and well-planned events was the 23rd Annual American Society of Biomechanics     Meeting held for the first time in Pittsburgh this past October. The local     organizing committee chaired by Drs. Lars Gilbertson and myself planned for     months to ensure everything would go smoothly and visitors traveled from all     over the world to enjoy the perfect balance of science and fun. Sessions ranged     from sports biomechanics and cardiovascular biomechanics to modeling and neural     control. Poster sessions allowed many students to display their work. A highlight     of the opening ceremony was a keynote lecture delivered by Professor Y.C.     Fung, the "Father of Modern Biomechanics", at the Carnegie Music Hall. Visitors     entering the music hall were first greeted by the music of our very own talented     Dr. Lars Gilbertson, Kathryne Stabile and Damion Shelton who dazzled listeners     with their string and piano ensemble. After an explosive introduction, Professor     Fung identified how to do things correctly making difficult projects look     easy and reviewed biomedical engineering from a historical perspective in     a memorable lecture entitled "Next Bioengineering: How to live long happily?".     To complete the events, conference attendees piled onto buses and climbed     aboard the Gateway Clipper to enjoy a night of dinner, dancing, magic and     gambling. The conference was a great success and established Pittsburgh as     a city to remember. </font></p>  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000"><b><img src="images/poj5.jpg" width="245" height="167"><br>    </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ASB Meeting     local organizing committee</b></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have also been successful     in gaining extramural funding. Grants were funded from a variety of sources.     The ACL and MCL groups successfully renewed their grants through the National     Institutes of Health, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Pittsburgh     Tissue Engineering Initiative. The MCL group was also successful in obtaining     funding as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund has awarded a $25,000 grant. The     PCL group was awarded four new grants this year from various sources including     a $100,000 grant. From The Aircast foundation, a $50,000 from Johnson & Johnson,     a $15,000 grant from The American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine     and a $5,000 grant from The Orthopaedic Fellows Foundation. The Growth and     Development Laboratory was also successful this year, as they were awarded     over $1 million from sources including the National Institutes of Health,     the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering     Initiative. The Ferguson Laboratory continued their success and extended a     $200,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health. Also a $450,000 grant     from the V.A. Hospital as well as two $5,000 Pittsburgh Foundation grants     were awarded. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have also done well     by submitting a large number of proposals. The ACL group has submitted four     Ferguson grants for $5,000. The Upper Extremity group has submitted proposals     to the National Science Foundation for $200,000, the National Institutes of     Health for $800,000, and a Pittsburgh Foundation grant for $5,000.

Dr. Richard Debski,     Dr. James Wang, myself organized The International Symposium on Ligaments     and Tendons held one day before the ORS at the Grand Floridian Resort in Orlando,     Florida. With 106 attendees, this meeting was unique in that there was extra     time allotted for discussion to allow students and faculty to receive extensive     quality feedback on their research. From the MSRC, Dr. James Wang and Tracy     Vogrin, M.S. both gave talks at the scientific sessions while Dr. Pat McMahon     and Eric Wong, B.S. presented during the short presentations. We have received     numerous positive feedback from this endeavor. Many others had heard about     the meeting afterwards and would like to join next year and it will become     an annual meeting for years to come. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In August, 1999, the third     annual Summer Student Symposium was held. Each undergraduate student presented     the successes and challenges they faced as they worked on their project throughout     the summer. The presentations were judged by the faculty of the MSRC. The     winners included Damion Shelton, Rob Svitek, Jon Fischer and Karen Reisiger,     all University of Pittsburgh undergraduate students, and were given an award     to commemorate their achievements.</font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During this past year,     Dr. Maria Apreleva defended her doctoral. thesis and is continuing her academic     work at Harvard University.

Three boats braved the rapids with no near-death experiences.     The winners for the greatest distance between boat and passenger contest were     Mi Lee and Zeke Cassinelli as they sent their boat far ahead down the rapids     and decided to swim. Water fights were instigated by Ted Rudy and his numerous     water guns.</font></p>  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In January, the MSRC     organized a ski trip at Hidden Valley Ski Resort proving once again the MSRC's     love for adventure. Yukihisa Fukuda dazzled us with his snowboarding ability.     Those Japanese fellows can really fly! Joon Lee and Mi Lee should definitely     make the Korean ski team while Ted Rudy says his goal is to ski free past     70! Unfortunately, we did have one casualty. Zeke Cassinelli took a bad fall     on his snowboard and suffered a forearm fracture. He has recovered quickly     but it is rumored that he will be selling his snowboard soon! </font></p>  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">December brought the holidays     and the 3rd annual MSRC Christmas brunch. The brunch was held at the Biomedical     Science Tower and featured a full-breakfast menu. It was a wonderful morning     shared by the MSRC. Mrs. Pattie Woo and Mrs. Sandie Fischer also joined us     to make it a truly special event. </font></p>  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During ORS in early March,     the MSRC laboratory lunch was held at the Rainforest Café in Orlando, Florida.     The MSRC enjoyed a delicious lunch while surrounded by various animals in     the jungle. Every ten minutes they had to endure an indoor thunderstorm that     drove the wildlife mad! </font></p>  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000"><img src="images/poj16.jpg" width="252" height="221"><br>    </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>MSRC hanging     out with Spiderman in Orlando</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     </font></p>  <a name="sabatical"></a><hr>  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#0000FF"><b>MY     SABBATICAL LEAVE</b></font></font></p>  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Meanwhile, I am taking     a six-month sabbatical leave from the University. Pattie and I have been enjoying     the warm winter (although a little rainy) in California at Stanford University.     This is a much needed break from our normal routines. Both of us have been     invigorated and feel energized. The sabbatical is also a test on the maturity     level of the MSRC. Things appear to go exceedingly well without my presence     as the faculty and Dr. Fu have provided the needed leadership (I am grateful!).     Although the jury is still out, I can say that I take great pride of everyone's     willingness to turn it up a notch. There have been no serious problems of     any kind as the MSRC continues to be successful and productive. </font></p>  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While at Stanford, I am     learning more about functional assessment of body motion from my colleagues     as well as participating in special courses such as bioengineering research     and development as well as tissue engineering. Also, much efforts have been     devoted to the understanding of new biotechnology firms as well as dot com     companies. Hopefully upon my return, the MSRC can collaborate and derive funding     from some of these companies as well as engage in the entrepreneur spirits     of start-ups. Meanwhile, I have found time to exercise regularly (increasing     some muscle mass?) and get back on the tennis courts frequently. We have also     had the opportunity to indulge on much fine fresh seafood in Chinese restaurants     here. </font></p>  <table width="312" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">    <tr>      <td width="231">        <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000"><img src="images/poj19.jpg" width="230" height="299"><br>          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">ASB           Program Book published by MSRC</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000">           </font></div>      </td>      <td width="71">         <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000"><img src="images/poj20.jpg" width="226" height="309"><br>          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">ISL&T           Program Book published by MSRC </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000">           </font></div>      </td>    </tr>  </table>  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">     </font></b></font></p>  </div><h6 ALIGN="left">&nbsp; </h6></body></html>
