By Neon-Lenz</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>Admin, no damage was done
to your website, neither did i look/steal/delete your data. I've re-named
your .htm to .ori. If you need help into fixing and protecting</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>your webserver for future
use, then e-mail me at <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">neonlenz@hushmail.com</a></font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-2>China
and Taiwan</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>First of all i want to clear
up a few things, i am neither FOR, nor AGAINST China or Taiwan. My purpose
was to keep the peace between those 2 countries. There</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>are already enough innocent
people killed. I just want China to stop forcing Taiwan to give their country
back, since the Taiwanese people are happy with the way</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>it is now. Also Government
of China, why would you attack Taiwan, they are your own people remember
! But since China is a communistic country already tells</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>you that they're difficult
to handle with, so you actually can't expect them to give up. If that is
the case then there is no other solution than to have Taiwan to</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>surrender, it's their only
hope to prevent any more killings.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2><font color="#FF0000">Politicians</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>I think another important
thing is that the politicians don't really realize that innocent people
get killed for nothing. But, what if that happens to the politicians'</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>family ? You should realize
what the feelings are of others and try to sense how it would be if it
happens to you. And not only about yourself, your power and your</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>money. If you really want
that, then put the politicians in a ring and let them kill each other there.&nbsp;
Just try not to get innocent people involved in all this which</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>they don't even care about
if they are living in Taiwan or China, all they want is peace...</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2></font></font>
