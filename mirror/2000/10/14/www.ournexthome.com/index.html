<b>The reason behind this defacement is because I wanted to let everyone
know about the killings that have been going on. This shit is stupid. Why
would anyone kill another person? People die of natural causes, desease,
and other illnesses everyday, there is no need to kill people. Killing
shows such inferiority. It's like a country kills other people in other
countries to show that they have what it takes to kill. When really, the
country doing the killing is just scared that the other country does not
ph34r them. That's just stupid. I got up this morning and read the
newspaper, headlining news around my area is 'Palestinians reluctant to
attend summit' I'll just type out the whole article, word for word.<br>
"Jerusalem - Despite international pressure, Yasser Arafat on Friday
refused to attend a mideast summit until Israel agrees to stop firing at
Palestinian demonstrators at flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza.
In the West Bank, violence persisted with two Palestinians killed by
Israel gunfire. In Jerusalem, Israeli police masquerading as Palestinians
seized two Arab teen-agers throwing stones at the U.S. Consulate and beat
them while holding them in a chokehold.<br>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan led diplomatic efforts to bring together
Mr. Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at a U.S.-led summit at
Egypt's Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheik. After meeting Mr. Arafat,
Mr. Annan said he was optimistic a summit could be held in Egypt within
two days.<br>
President Clinton called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other Arab
leaders to win their backing for a summit. Mr. Mubarak spoke with
Mr. Arafat six times over the past 24 hours to try to persuade him to
attend, Israel TV's Channel Two said. Mr. Annan was headed for Egypt
today.<br>
Palestinian officials were skeptical, though they said mediation efforts
would continue.<br>
'Israel must stop its attacks, and if Barak does not agree to the
Palestinian conditions, there will not be a summit,' Palestinian
negotiator Nabil Shaath said.<br>
Mr. Afrat wants Israel to withdraw troops from the entrances of
Palestinian cities, lift a siege of West Bank towns and agree to the
establishment of an international commission of inquiry into the
violence.<br>
Mr. Barak also appeared reluctant. 'We have no problem with attending a
summit that will stop the violence,' Mr. Barak told Israel TV's Channel
One. 'We are not willing to get there by rewarding violence.'<br>
Across the West Bank, Palestinians marched to protest Israel's rocket
attacks Thursday against Palestinian government buildings, including
police stations and broadcast centers.<br>
Israel fired the missles in retribution for the brutal killing of two
Israeli reserve soldiers by a Palestinian mob in a police station in the
West Bank town of Ramallah.<br>
Standing on the ruins of the police station hit by Israeli rockets, Marwan
Barghouti, the West Bank leader of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement, exhorted a
cheering crowd to stand tough. 'This is our fight and we defy Barak and
his tnaks and planes,' said Mr. Barghouti, who has been singled out by
Mr. Barak as the mastermind of shooting attacks on Israelis.<br>
Ninety-six people, most Palestinians, have been killed in 16 days of
clashes triggered by the visit of Israel's hardline opposition leader,
Ariel Sharon, to a Jerusalem shrine holy to Jews and Muslims.
