<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday the 13th is known for its horror
features, for centuries it has been believed to be the night that the 12 most
powerful witches and warlocks would meet in hell with Lucifer.&nbsp; On these
nights years ago<img border="0" src="pulse2.gif" width="10" height="10"> in the
middle ages people feared as if hell would be coming to earth. Many would not
come from their homes. Others that would worship Lucifer as a god and then would
begin rituals of sacrificing other humans and animals, killing them and letting
their souls and blood run down into the depths of hell. And by performing this
act they would then start to feel immortality. Especially on a night where that
the moon was full, it would bring them strength and visions from Lucifer. Many
of times family members of the one that is being sacrificed would be forced to
watch as their loved ones were slowly and painfully taken from this world down
into hell. Sometimes, they were burned alive other times they would be slowly
cut so that their blood would become secrete and then it would be used as a gift
or offering to the witches and warlocks so that they can present it to Lucifer.<img border="0" src="pulse2.gif" align="texttop" width="20" height="20"></p>
