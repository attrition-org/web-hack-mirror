<p><font size=+0><b>For who don't like defacements:</b> <font color="#FF0000">STOP
HERE!</font></font>
<br><font size=+0>Are you making that here?</font>
<p><font size=+0>Wow doods, I'm here to say for you! Once more! #&amp;!$%</font>
<p>This defacement isn't for Anti Security Hackers (ops, Anti Security
Lamers Re Defacers HAHAHA). First off, I want to fuck Anti Security Lamer's
ass. And to inform that re defacements are lame. Yeah! I know that you
are lamers! But I ask for that you re-deface not my defacements. OK? Once
more: all know that they are ghey msadc2.pl kiddies. They fuck one Linux
box (mount -t nfs www.blahblah.com.br:/ /imhaxor probably HEH.) and one
Irix box (login with null pass) that I fixed not, because interested not
me. I use only shit boxen for defacements, son of bitch! #$&amp;% HAHAHA.
They knows only the command "echo". Sees <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/10/12/www.sopracontrariar.com.br/">here</a>.
HEH. dududuh... =)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Any people ask me why I make my defacements in English. For you:
<br><u>My</u> defacements are in English because I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IM SAYING.
<br>If you are a stupid, and do not speak English, Its not my fault. So.
<b><u>FUCK YOU!</u></b>
<br>My defacements aren&acute;t just for you, ya know?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Hey Hitler Crew, are you dead too? HAHAHAHAHA. I hope thats a yes =)!
<b><u>FUCK YOU FAGGOTS!</u></b>

<br><b><u><font color="#FFFFFF">p4ntera's innocent little quote:</font></u></b></center>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey guys. You remember me? Of course you do, I was
(and probably still am) the most hated man on the net. Do I give half a
shit? no.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">The reason I decided to take my time out to fix
this guys html is well, because he one of the only cool brazilians I have
met. That goes for you hackernews.com.br. You stupid racist fucks, I'm
glad I have root on your system. All those emails you sent out saying "Ohh
some hacker got me" and then email them back saying its a "test". It's
me you dumbfucks, learn the skill.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Anti-Security? r00t.br? x-s4nder (aka x-rds'r),
I think you better step down before you sacks of shit get smacked down.&nbsp;
I am sick and tired of you little brazilian kiddies, having find a day
off of your regular begging for money off of some christian funding show,
going off and rds'ng and frontpaging sites. AND STOP SAYING YOU ROOTED
IT. ROOT != NT. You fucking morons.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Hitler crew, I know who you are. The only reason
your doing that shit is for publicity. Well you got it, maybe not the kind
you want? I don't care. Hitler is dead,&nbsp; hitler was stalin's bitch
and it'll forever stay that way. You wanna step up to my boys hackweiser?
lol. Learn some skill first you fat white kids. (which isn't ./telnetd
BTW)</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">*sighs*</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">80m, I don't even have to get in with what you
try to bring. You bring nothing. Hackweiser figured out how you accessed
that (rather weak) IRIX box in the first place. Boy, its funny. Guest:guest
accounts can get you far huh? Then on your (ugly) looking webpage, you
rant on how "mafia boy should be saved". l o fucking l. Do you even have
the slightest clue what he is? He used to go on efnet and beg for shells,
and then whore trade them in #!tnt. Then using these shells, he DDoS'd
Vetesgirls webserver. Hate her or not, thats fucking lame.&nbsp; Then he
goes off on efnet and continues to brag about it. THEN, with his phones
being tapped, he gets busted <u>bragging about it some more</u>. Jeez kids,
that isn't that smart now is it.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">BTW, your not fooling anyone with your 80m shit.
You aren't ADM, stop pretending you are.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">And RCMP, I hear you think you got my location.
You don't. Stop saying you do. You said i was "caught bragging about defaced
websites on irc". Then you bring some irc logs with <u>some other nick</u>
talking about it. You retards irc logs means shit.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Lamers these days... geez.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to shout all my boys in hackweiser,
seeing as they are doing a good job of getting in the news and ducking
the feds, at the same time. (No i ain't in it, damn feds). Keep up the
works doods.</font>
