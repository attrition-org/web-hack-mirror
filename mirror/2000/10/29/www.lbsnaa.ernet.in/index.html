Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy Of Administration (India) hacked! .................Reasons .. Free Kashmir and stop the violence at the Line Of COntrol(LOC). Stop killing our Kashmiri brothers and stop blaming Pakistan for everything. Stop thinking that your IT skills are good! Stop thinking that our Army is against you people and stop thinking that hacking is evil! STOP!!!!..............................................Diwali Season, right?.......................................So m0r0n and nightman and all the Pakistani wish you all a great Diwali............................. Why did we hack this server? Because this is an IT site and a training institute.......................................Why do wew put this stuff here? So that people might look and grab the reality and spread the word about what IT skills INdia has! And what they are doing to our Kashmiri BROTHERS!.......................................How did we hack into this server? Everyone knos that so we do not need to answer this question.......................................................Why do not we put proper Htmls? Because we do not have time to create/compile htmls all the time we hack into a different server. This saves a lot of time and creates a very good result so we love this.... basically we enter do OUR stuff, delete the logs and vanish! ..........................................................What do we gain from this? We feel gay and happy when we hack into INDIAN IT SITES and we feel sad when we see our kashmiri brothers being killed. We are sure that this way we can create more awareness. If our moto is clear and our thinking is right when WE GAIN A LOT FROM THIS!! ok??? .......................................................Who are we?
