<p><b><u>THE TRUTH!</u></b>
<br>duh =) HEH.
<p>Well, I'm here to say once more. I think that you know its me, again.
<p>Hmm.. One reason for this defacement is to say that the name of our
group has changed. We're called
<b><font color="#FF0000">kn0wledge</font></b>
now. Why? Because many groups use the word "r00t" in they're names. Generally
these people don't know what r00t is. HEH. I think that a person that defaces
NT boxen and uses "r00t" in their names, doesn't know what they are talking
about. HAHAH. Anothers groups says that wants to show vulnerabilities to admin. But... why they sends 
defacements to attrition? HEH.
<br><b>For j00: root =! NT box.</b>
<p>I have a message for some brazilians pigs: you don't like us, and we
don't like you. Why? Because you are lamers, plain and simple.. You enter
#hackernews and you think that you are hax0rs. You could be studying or
working, but you prefer to be speaking the life for another person. Therefore,
that shows you guys are nothing but little shits.. HAHAH. You speak badly
of the people who you envy. I understand.
<p>Some people on #hackernews that don't like defacements: are you coders
(hehe)? Why don't you like defacements? Why do you visit attrition all
time? HAHAH. Remember: you don't like defacements. I think that you want
others to think that you are hax0rs, but that you aren't defacers. Thing
is, you can't do either, so your just worthless slugs..
<p>Hey x-s4nd3r, you said that I don't know you. But I see your defacements
on attrition, and don't like your attitude. So thats all I need.
<p>Ah! We keep going!
<br>* don't you just love us *
<br>We are against Carnivore too. Where's our privacy? Our rights? NO CARNIVORE!
IT'S STUPID! FUCK YOU FBI!
<p>To rds kiddies: I'm sick and tired of you too. I want to fuck your mom
up the ass.
<br>
<p>To one little kid called kewron: hey dood, I never give you shells.
If you say that I give shells, then your just lying outta your ass.&nbsp;
You like to use others shells. That, is fucking lame.. I know that you
learned command "ls" and you think that you are hacker. You know that I
know that you never hack anything. =). All your shells are others.&nbsp;
I don't like lamers DDoS'ng shit on brasnet. It's lame too. You don't have
a good reason. You want respect, but you don't have it, or will get it..
Now please stop, I won't send a fuck you to you, simply because your a
good person in real life.
<p>HEH. Feds and brazilians wants us. HAHA. pj33r!
