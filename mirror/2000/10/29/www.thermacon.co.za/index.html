Cry<br>
by: </strong></font><a href="mailto:D.Adams@nhm.ac.uk"><font
color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>D.B.Adams</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">A long plaintive
wail emanated from the cardboard box. Whether Jacob had seen the
box or heard the cry first, he could not be sure, but he was
certain that the pitiful sound came from the box. At once he was
regretting taking the short cut from the Burger bar to the car
park, he had always felt uncomfortable using it after dark. The
passage between the Record shop and the Butchers was only just
wide enough for one person and it was badly lit with a single
bulb. Where it opened out behind the shops, anyone could be
hiding in the dark out of sight of the High Street, hardly
visible in the shadows from the vast empty car park. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">Still he had
something else to worry about this time because there was that
cry again, audible above the sound of the fans on the
refrigeration unit at the back of the Butchers shop. It was a
heart rending sound of loneliness, pain and hunger, that brought
back memories of childhood punishments, when Jacob's mother
locked him in his bedroom without any dinner or supper. He could
hear her voice even now, all these years later, &quot;You
disgusting little monster&quot;. What was that awful sound? What
should he do about it? Leave it probably, let some one else sort
it out. Nobody had helped him then locked in his bedroom or in
the dark under stairs cupboard, shivering in his wet pyjamas, his
cries drowned out by his mothers ranting and the loud rumble of
the washing machine. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">The cry went on
long and pathetic, rising and falling in pitch. It was probably
some kittens, the abandoned and unwanted offspring of a family
pet, discarded by a callous owner. If it was and if he opened the
box, what then? He would then feel responsible for them, would
have to take them home. No, better to leave them for someone
else, not his problem. But the cry was echoing round the alley,
echoing inside his head, there was something about it that
sounded almost human. Perhaps it was a baby shut in the box, he
thought, in the dark.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">He couldn't leave
a baby shut inside a box, alone in the dark. Jacob knew how that
felt, to be shut in, how you could not breathe, how you began to
sweat, how you could feel the blood rushing and roaring through
your temples and the contents of your stomach rising in your
throat. The waves of panic that wash hot and cold through the
body.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">And Jacob knew if
there was any chance that it could be a baby, he had no choice
but to look inside the box. He was within a foot of the cardboard
box when suddenly there was a slight movement from the box and
the crying ceased, all was quiet except the thrum of the fans in
the butchers shop wall. The top of the box was sealed with wide
brown parcel tape, Jacob managed to get his fingernail under the
end and peeled off the tape in one go. Pulling open the flaps he
stared into the shadowy darkness, trying to make some sense of
the shape within. It didn't look like a baby, in fact there
seemed to be more than one set of eyes blinking back at him.
&quot;Kittens, I was right the first time&quot; he thought,
reaching in with both hands to pick one up. Taloned hands grabbed
both his wrists, sudden and vice like, searing pain shot up his
arms.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">He yelled out and
tried to pull away. The claws pulled back, hard and sharp,
digging into his flesh and forcing him off balance. Jacob
realised that there was no way he could stop himself falling head
first into the cardboard box. As his head entered the box more
small clawing hands grabbed at it, pulling at his hair and ears,
he felt the sharp talons enter his nostrils, dig into his neck
and shoulders. Even as his chest passed into the box Jacob was
aware of the wet and warm, strangely comforting feeling spreading
through the front of his trousers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Arial">Then as the claws
pulled the rest of his body down into the darkness, he felt the
hot and cold waves of panic running through his body. As he
struggled for breath, the blood roaring in his ears, his shouts
of terror began to subside, turning first into a whimper, then
into a long plaintive wail.</font></p>
