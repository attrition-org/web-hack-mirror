  Well the main reason for this hack attack is to bring some spirit into defacements. 
  I see the wackest defacements daily at attrition and other well known mirrors. 
  Why not just take a little time to actually make your defacement look good? 
  It can't be that hard for you considering you actually spent the time rooting 
  the box in the first place. Don't let people think we are just some immature 
  kids messing around. Some people said my defacements were &quot;lame&quot;...&quot;how 
  old are you, 9?&quot; They also wrote that in e133t t3xt...doing this type of 
  stuff makes you look immature. If you are going to be sending a message out 
  and you are acting like that-showing your text in letters and numbers that half 
  the people you actually reach can't read, people wont take you seriously. Show 
  a little respect to the people who have to see your defacement too. Don't degrade 
  yourself by putting something offensive on them. I hope every defacer who see's 
  this takes my advice. Another reason for this defacement is to spread my message's 
  below, so please read on.</font><br>

  <font face="arial" size="2" color="#FF0000">Well, Save Napster. Napster and its 
  users are growing stronger each day. Due to the large amount of e-mails received 
  daily I will be telling you here how you can help the Napster battle. First 
  off, you can e-mail or snail mail the record companies that are against Napster. 
  These addresses can be found on Napster.com. Tell them you are a Napster user 
  and still buy CD's, mail them a scanned picture of a receipt or the actual receipt 
  for snail mailers. Second, you can rid yourself of the artists who do not support 
  Napster. Such as Metallica. Simply forget about downloading and buying their 
  songs, instead download and buy the people who DO support Napster. Hopefully 
  we wont have to stoop to such negativity, but whatever it takes will work for 
  now.<br>

  Over the years there has been a numerous amount of deaths on Halloween. So everyone 
  reading this, please play it safe. And stay away from those evil cults! No more 
  fires either, Devil's Night(night before Halloween) is the worse night of the 
  year for arson fires. I agree vandalism is sometimes fun, but come on...setting 
  fires? <br>

  Reno, are you really that low to send a kid to jail? The harm was done by NASA 
  themselves, neglegence. If the government actually took the time to secure their 
  computers then maybe none of this would have been a major issue. Plus, they 
  are the ones who decided to shut down the computers for 21 days. That is where 
  the harm came in. They brought it upon themselves. Hopefully the spirits of 
  Halloween night will catch up with your right and wrongs! Muwahahaha.</font><font face="arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><font color="#FFCC33"><br>
