        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Where exactly the first computer 
          viruses came from is a bit of a mystery. Certainly the early viruses 
          tended not to be malicious. One of the earliest viruses was called worms 
          and was not meant to be malevolent and simply got out of hand. Concept, 
          which was one of the first Microsoft Word Viruses was probably written 
          by someone who was trying to show the flaws in Word. What seems to have 
          a grain of truth is that the first dangerous viruses came out of Bulgaria 
          in the mid to late eighties. There may have been earlier ones but this 
          is when they started to hit the market in greater volumes. The story 
          develops that it was mainly disgruntled Government employees who tended 
          to write the&nbsp; programmes or possibly someone from the underground 
          movement. The Internet and the growth of personal computers have dramatically 
          increased&nbsp; the field for viruses to spread. My first encounter 
          with a virus was in 1990. I loaded a floppy to be told that I had been 
          stoned. I simply took out the 5 1/4 floppy Disk, switched off my machine 
          and rebooted with my boot disk. However, now that 99.99% of computers 
          have a hard disk, things are not as simple. Recently Flash Bios viruses 
          have emerged and viruses that destroy your hard disk. </font></p>

<p align="left"><big><u><strong><font color="#000000">WHAT IS A VIRUS</font>?</strong></u></big></p>

<p>One of the early pioneers of viruses research is Dr Fred Cohen who submitted his thesis
in 1986. Dr. Cohen's definition of a computer virus as &quot;a program that can 'infect'
other programs by modifying them to include a ... version of itself&quot; is generally
accepted as a standard. </p>

<p>A computer virus is a program that replicates itself, attaches to other programs, and
performs unsolicited or unwanted, if not malicious, actions when it executes. The two
fundamental virus categories are &#147;boot&#148; and &#147;file&#148; viruses<br>
Boot viruses dwell in the boot sector of the hard or floppy disk that carries them. These
execute as your computer starts. Once they copy themselves into your computer&#146;s
memory, they can then spread to other disks or other computers on a network, each time
leaving copies of themselves that can repeat the cycle.<br>
<br>
File viruses become active only when you execute the program that carries them. Typically,
such viruses infect files with the extensions .EXE, .COM, or .DLL, and non-executable
files such as Microsoft Word or Excel data and template files. Once executed, the file
virus also loads itself into your computer&#146;s memory, then replicates and attaches
itself to other executable programs.</p>

<p>New viruses are being written&nbsp; at about one hundred per month. No virus software
can be foolproof but you can try your best to stay clean from viruses.</p>

<p>For companies the cost associated with viruses is the man time&nbsp; updating
anti-virus software or a greater cost of cleaning infections. Even at ten minutes per
computer this soon adds up if you have 1000's of computers.</p>

<p>.The following list describes some of the characteristics of common viruses. </p>

<big><u><strong>Hardware Danger</strong></u></big></big></p>

<p>Until recently it was common for a bad virus attack to leave you with the need 
  to reformat the hard drive and reinstall your programmes and data. However, 
  with the newer machines having Flash BIOS that is easily upgraded. Flash BIOS 
  can be on Graphics Cards, Modems and Motherboards etc. There is a real risk 
  that if you get infected by a hardware virus that it could cost you hundreds 
  of pounds.</p>

<p>The most dangerous virus in this category&nbsp; is known as &quot;Variant CHI&quot;. 
  This was originally spread by a free disk on a Games Magazine. The machine is 
  effectively dead once infected.</p>

<p><big><big><u><strong>Some Myths</strong></u></big></big></p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p align="left">AOL had all their e-mail addresses hacked by a hacker as did Microsoft 
  a few months ago and that is where one of the famous virus myths came from the 
  hoax was called &quot;Good times virus, or win a free holiday.&quot; </p>
</font>
<font SIZE="3">

<p><strong>THERE ARE NO SUCH VIRUSES.</strong></p>

<p>Some basic principles about viruses: 
<ol>
  <li>They can not be part of a text file (They are a programme). An e-mail is 
    usually a text file. </li>
  <li>They can be part of an e-mail but then only as an attachment, you would 
    have to click on the attachment and open the file. If you had your virus software 
    running and up to date it would not allow you to do this. I suggest you log 
    onto <a href="http://www.grisoft.com">grisoft.com</a> and download AVG this 
    is free for personal use.</li>
  <li>You would have to be pretty dumb to open an attachment from a file from someone you did
    not know.</li>
  <li>Most servers run junk e-mail software and therefore you just don&#146;t get the same
    Spam.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&nbsp; get a lot of e-mail and I have only twice had a virus on e-mail.</p>

<p>I have seen four viruses in the last two years and I surf a lot. Two of these 
  were old and archaic and easily dealt with. The other two were on the net. I 
  worked out that my infection rate over the last two years is about 800hrs surfing 
  per virus. </p>
<p>I have lots of disks from different people and surf and have companies send 
  me software and I rarely see one. When I do I get all excited because they are 
  rare and if you have the right virus software and have kept it up to date they 
  are very rarely dangerous. A big Computer Hardware company sent me some new 
  drivers for my soundcard and I discovered that the disk was infected with the 
  Wazzu Virus. On contacting them I was thanked for telling them and they said 
  &quot;We don't run any anti-virus software on our machines, we wait for the 
  public to tell us.&quot;&nbsp; A thousand disks had been sent out with the virus 
  on them.</p>
</font> 
<p><font size="4"><u><strong>A CAUTIOUS NOTE REGARDING MIRC</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">Internet Relay Chat or MIRC has been growing dramatically in the last
nine years since it started on EFnet. However, custom designed Trojan horses, viruses and
scripts have been written. A couple of the more common ones are Script.ini and
DMSETUP.EXE, both are designed to copy passwords and allow access to your computer. They
are self replicating and you send them to other people on line.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">The other script that I have encountered recently is where the script
reassigns your keyboard keys. This is easily solved by uninstalling MIRC</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">Our advice for MIRC is as follows:-</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Do not have auto-accept enabled in MIRC options</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Do not accept a file from anyone, whoever they are. </font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Be wary of people who &quot;WhoIS&quot; you.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Have a virus checker resident in memory at all times</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Uninstall MIRC weekly and wipe any files associated with it and
    re-install it from a zipped file or fresh download.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Never give out your e-mail address unless you know the person personally.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Steer away from any hackers channels.</font></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><u><strong>JAVA AND ACTIVEX</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">Although not strictly viruses as such, a lot of concern has been
expressed regarding whether or not Java Applets could be used to run malicious programmes
through a users Web Browser. The same with Active X because it runs a programme on the
users computer. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">Both ActiveX and Java include safeguards designed to prevent harm to
your computer system. Nevertheless, determined programmers have developed objects that use
Java or ActiveX to read data on your hard disk; pass it back to websites you visit;
compose and send offensive e-mail in your name; corrupt or destroy your data; or cause
other damage to your system.<br>
<br>
Dangerous objects such as these can often lurk on websites until you visit and download
them to your system, usually without realising that they exist. Most browser software
includes a feature that allows you to block ActiveX controls or Java applets altogether;
or to turn on security features that authenticate objects before downloading them to your
system. However, these approaches can deprive you of the interactive benefits of websites
you visit by indiscriminately blocking all objects, dangerous or not.</font><font size="4"><small>
The latest anti-virus software can be set to detect malicious Java and ActiveX. </small></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><u><strong>SO WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT VIRUSES</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">You could ignore them and hope that they will go away. Or only act after
the event. I failed to install anti-virus software in 1993 and ended up losing all my data
and having to re-format my hard drive.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">Our recommended action plan:-</font> 

<ol>
  <li><strong><font SIZE="3">Run anti-virus software and keep it regularly updated.(at least
    monthly)</font></strong></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Scan all disks whoever they are from, don't trust other business to do
    the work for you.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">If you are a business then make it a sacking offence for bringing in
    disks &nbsp;from outside (especially on floppies) that are not authorised, games disks
    from someone's son or daughter in the playground are the most risky. This may seem harsh
    but all your computers&nbsp; could be damaged.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Do not run attachments from e-mail unless you know the source.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Be very careful about sharing disks from other computers.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Do not download files from the Internet unless you know the company or it
    is recommended by someone you trust.</font></li>
  <li><strong><font SIZE="3">Do not download from a Warez site.</font></strong></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Take extra vigilance on MIRC not to accept any files</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">When running attachments to newsgroups files be cautious.</font></li>
  <li><strong><font SIZE="3">Do not send a file knowingly that contains a virus, even if it is
    a practical joke. You could go to prison.</font></strong></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">If you encounter virus like activity on your machine, run anti-virus
    software and if your machine is still exhibiting virus symptoms, then get expert help. Do
    not continue to run the machine as you are infecting other users and the virus may be
    replicating.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="3">Purchase virus software today. Tomorrow is too late.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="5"><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="3">Although virus infection is low for the majority of users you have a
real chance of encountering at least one in the next year. If it's a harmless practical
joke virus your okay. If not and it is one that wipes your BIOS, look for a new
Motherboard. Protect yourself today and take steps today to cut down the chances of
infection.</font></p>
