      <H3>Seeking 'Smart Money'<BR>NY tech firms hit West Coast capital 
      confab</H3>By Ilan Greenberg. SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
      <P>San Francisco-Twenty-eight of New York City's newest and brightest 
      high-tech start-up companies met here yesterday searching for cash-but not 
      just any cash. 
      <P>These Silicon Alley firms came looking for Silicon Valley's fabled 
      "Smart Money." Smart money is the label given to venture-capital funds 
      that offer a benefit beyond simply an infusion of cash. Nascent high-tech 
      companies increasingly look to venture capitalists for everything from 
      executive placement to a network of potential partners-in effect, 
      membership in an exclusive and profitable club house-services that 
      California venture capitalists are famous for giving their roster of 
      start-up investments. 
      <P>"The New York investment community has been slow to embrace the 
      Internet, so the hard-core technology dollars are out here ," said Brad 
      Farkas, a partner at i-Hatch Ventures, a venture-capital firm on Park 
      Avenue in New York. 
      <P>That perception is behind the draw of the annual "Alley to the Valley" 
      conference, now in its third year. The conference, which runs through 
      today, is co-sponsored by the New York City Economic Development Corp. and 
      AlleyCat News, a magazine covering the city's Silicon Alley neighborhood. 
      <P>The conference's sponsors select the 28 companies as New York's most 
      promising new crop of start-ups, mostly doing business over the Internet. 
      <P>For the companies, the conference is a coming out party where 
      executives can shmooze Silicon Valley's elite, as well as each other. 
      <P>The conference also is meant to serve as buzz for New York City's 
      ongoing effort to be considered a tech capital, especially by business 
      decision-makers in Silicon Valley. 
      <P>"We expect to get more recognition," said Michael G. Carey, president 
      of the city's Economic Development Corp., which is an arm of the Mayor's 
      office. 
      <P>"I think New York City has arrived. It's time we got recognized for 
      that." The companies at the conference, all of which had to be invited by 
      the sponsors, range from PredictIt!, a Web site that hopes to make money 
      by selling ordinary people's predictions posted over the Internet, to 
      WebAppointments.com, an online appointment system for doctors and hair 
      salons, to RocketBoard Inc., a special computer keyboard designed to make 
      the Internet as easy to use as a TV remote control. 
      <P>For the entrepreneurs behind these companies, this year's conference is 
      a gateway to Silicon Valley-style venture funding. Recent statistics on 
      high-tech investments in New York companies underline its importance. 
      Since 1997, initial public offering equity and venture funding has 
      funneled $6 billion into New York Internet start-ups, according to the New 
      York New Media Association. 
      <P>"It's no problem to get money thrown at us," said Kevin Lee, president 
      of Briefme.com, an Internet newsletter delivery service on Seventh Avenue 
      in Manhattan. "But you can get into trouble by taking dumb money. We want 
      money that comes with the ability to network and the potential for 
      strategic alliances." In addition, some New York start-ups concentrating 
      on non-Internet related technology complain that New York venture capital 
      is fixated on traditional New York businesses, such as advertising and 
      content. 
      <P>"We have a half-million now, but I could really use $30 million to get 
      my company rolling," said Chip Ruhnke, president of iStreamTV, an company 
      building products for receiving Internet content through TVs. "New York 
      VCs [venture capitalists] don't understand us." While the start-up 
      companies here were limited to Silicon Alley, new efforts are underway to 
      create new high-tech centers in New York. Carey of the Economic 
      Development Corp. identified Long Island City as the next candidate for 
      his department's marketing efforts. 
      <P>Turning the spotlight on other boroughs has taken on a note of urgency 
      because of skyrocketing commercial rates in Silicon Alley, according to 
      high-tech executives. 
      <P>"In the spring of '98 we signed a lease for $17 a square foot," said 
      Bruce Frank, chief operating officer at Javelin Technologies Inc., on Wall 
      Street. 
      <P>"The going rate now is $36." The high cost of doing business downtown 
      has Andrew Merkatz, president of PredictIt!, looking at the outer boroughs 
      for a production facility. 
      <P>"There's just no more space left in Manhattan at a reasonable rent," he 
      said. 
      <P>At the conference in San Francisco, talk quickly shifted from the 
      subject of rent to the much more pressing need to find the VCs with smart 
      money to spend. During a lunch presentation by a well-known industry 
      executive, Stephanie M. Cohen of Javelin Technologies gave up trying to 
      find her CEO. 
      <P>"He must be out talking to venture capitalists," she said. "If these 
      other companies are smart, they'd skip the panel and do the same thing, 
      too." <!--END--></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
