              <font color="#0000FF">What is an e-magazine or e-zine?</font> <br>
              </B>An e-magazine is an e-mail based magazine. Unlike printed magazines 
              or even web-based magazines, e-zines (e-magazines) are delivered 
              via e-mail, and that means the news and information you want is 
              waiting for you in your e-mailbox whenever you decide to read it. 
              <B><br>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">What's in a BRIEFME e-magazine?</font> <br>
              </B>The BRIEFME e-magazine (for each <a href="../editor/list.cgi">topic</a>) 
              is filled with news, site reviews, and web article summaries. Each 
              BRIEFME topic has several editors that write the reviews and summaries. 
              The publisher then selects the best of the submitted items and publishes 
              the complete BRIEFME e-zine by sending it to the subscribers. <br>
              Each BRIEFME will typically contain 6 to 10 reviews/summaries. The 
              original site/article URL is referenced in every review, so you 
              will be able to simply click to see the entire article or site that 
              has been reviewed. (Some e-mail readers require copy and paste of 
              the URL).<B><br>
              Here is a <a href="../sample.htm">sample</a> of what a BRIEFME e-zine 
              looks like. <br>
              <br>
              <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Are BRIEFME e-magazines free?</FONT></B> <BR>
              YES, completely FREE. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Can I subscribe to more than one topic 
              / subject?</FONT></B> <BR>
              You can <a href="../subscribe/sub.cgi">subscribe</a> 
              to as many as you want. <BR>
              <BR>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">BRIEFME forgot to include a really important 
              topic / subject I know everyone is interested in. Can I make suggestions 
              for new topics?</font></b> <br>
              Drop us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@briefme.com">info@briefme.com</a>. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">What if I want to re-read a past issue 
              of BRIEFME, and I deleted my e-mail already?</font></b> <br>
              Just come to the site and click on <a href="../archive/index.htm">ARCHIVES</a>. 
              Then select the topic to get to the list of past BRIEFME issues. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">How are my issues of BRIEFME delivered?</font></b> 
              <br>
              To your e-mail, where they wait for you.<br>
              <br>
              <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Will I receive all my subscriptions in 
              one large e-mail?</FONT></B> <BR>
              No; the BRIEFME e-magazines are just like regular magazines. You 
              will get a separate issue for each topic every week, unless we have 
              not launched that topic yet. <BR>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">How long is a BRIEFME e-zine?</font></b> 
              <br>
              It depends on the topic, the amount of news, and how much other 
              great new stuff is reviewed that week, but most BRIEFME e-zines 
              contain 6 to 10 article or site reviews, each of which is one paragraph 
              long. We keep the BRIEFME issues brief, but complete.<br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">Do BRIEFME editors only review new sites?</font></b> 
              <br>
              Generally, yes, though many older sites have great new articles 
              and content of interest, so the editors are free to review those 
              articles/sections in addition to entirely new sites.<br>
              <br>
              <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Can I unsubscribe at any time?</FONT></B> 
              <BR>
              Just come back to our site, go into the &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; 
              section, enter your e-mail address, and click on &quot;unsubscribe.&quot; 
              Another way is to follow the directions at the bottom of every BRIEFME 
              e-magazine. You will get an e-mail with a special ID that proves 
              it's you when you visit the unsubscribe form. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">If I unsubscribe from one BRIEFME e-magazine, 
              can I continue to get the other topics?</FONT></B> <BR>
              You can modify your account as you wish. That is, you can <a href="../subscribe/unsubscribe.htm">unsubscribe</a> 
              from the topics you do not want (by un-checking the topics), and 
              you will continue to receive the others. <BR>
              <BR>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">How do I change my topics?</font></b> <br>
              Use the <a href="../subscribe/unsubscribe.htm">unsubscribe</a> 
              function, and you can modify your subscription status at any time. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">Why do you e-mail me during the unsubscribe 
              process?</font></b> <br>
              We want to make sure that only you can <a href="../subscribe/unsubscribe.htm">unsubscribe</a> 
              yourself. By e-mailing you an unsubscribe code, we know it is you 
              when you have completed the modifications to your subscription. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">How do I change my subscription address?</font></b> 
              <br>
              Simply unsubscribe your old address and re-subscribe with your new 
              address, using the regular forms.<br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">I didn't get my last issue. Why did that 
              happen?</font></b> <br>
              there are a number of factors that can lead to your e-mail not arriving 
              promptly:<br>
              - Your ISP or corporate mail system was down when we tried mailing 
              you.<br>
              - Your file system was full. <br>
              - Your address has changed. <br>
              - The Internet was acting up somewhere between you and our mail 
              server.<br>
              - Our mailing software hiccupped (we try to burp it regularly).<br>
              Of course, the <a href="../archive/index.htm">ARCHIVES</a> 
              are always available on our site.<br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">Does BRIEFME mail the newsletters in plain 
              text or HTML?</font></b> <br>
              We currently send out each BRIEFME e-magazine as regular text. That's 
              the format that works in every e-mail reader. In the future, we 
              may begin sending the e-zines out as HTML to those subscribers whose 
              method of reading their e-mail supports HTML. We will always give 
              subscribers a choice.<br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">I am worried about getting SPAM. Will I 
              get added to any mailing lists?</font></b> <br>
              We never release your e-mail to any third party. However, if you 
              selected to receive additional information on the topics you have 
              subscribed to, we may occasionally send you a special offer that 
              relates to the category you are interested in. We will never send 
              you an e-mail that isn't targeted to your interests. If you change 
              your mind and don't want the special information from the carefully 
              screened third parties, you can request to receive only the BRIEFME 
              subscription at any time. For details, see our <a href="../legal.htm">privacy 
              policy</a>. <br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">Do I have to subscribe to BRIEFME to enter 
              the contest?</font></b> <br>
              No; the contest is one of the ways we alert people to our valuable 
              service. <br>
              <br>
              <b><font color="#0000FF">Who writes the reviews?</font></b> <br>
              BRIEFME editors are chosen based on their writing ability, knowledge
