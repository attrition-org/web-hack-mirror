              <font color="#0000FF">How do I start earning cash and taking advantage 
              of other great BRIEFME affiliate benefits with the BRIEFME member 
              affiliate program? </font> <br>
              Simply fill out our Affiliate Member Application Form. We will review 
              it and let you know if you have been accepted as an affiliate member. 
              <br>
              <BR>
              <FONT

COLOR="#0000FF">I'm a smaller site, and I probably won't be sending that many 
              subscribers. Why should I join? </FONT> <BR>
              Larger and smaller sites all refer subscribers to BRIEFME and receive 
              both payment and link visibility proportional to the number of subscribers 
              they refer. Each subscriber to BRIEFME from your site increases 
              the number of times your site is included in the Featured Member 
              area. <br>
              In addition, you may refer your friends to become affiliates and 
              then you make money every time they send a subscriber. A few well-placed 
              calls or e-mails to your friends could mean serious revenue.<BR>
              <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">I'm a big site. How will I benefit by joining? 
              </FONT> <BR>
              As a big site, you can send a significant number of subscribers 
              to BRIEFME, resulting in both revenue and ongoing PR/exposure for 
              your site. You can't afford not to join. <BR>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">What is the difference between subscribers 
              and subscriptions? </font> <br>
              Each individual e-mail address is a subscriber. Some subscribers 
              request several subscrptions. We pay affiliates based on subscribers. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">How often do I get paid? </font> <br>
              We pay affiliates monthly, cutting checks the third week of the 
              month for the prior month's activity if your balance is above $35. 
              If your balance is below $35, then we will add your earnings to 
              the following month. <br>
              </FONT></p>
            <p><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"> <font color="#0000FF">How 
              do I check my current statistics and balance? </font> <br>
              When you are accepted as a BRIEFME affiliate, you will receive a 
              Login and Password. These will allow you to access your statistics, 
              including: how many click-throughs, how many subscribers, and current 
              $$ balance. <br>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">Can I be a non-U.S. resident? </font> <br>
              Yes, as long as your local laws do not prohibit the receipt of U.S. 
              funds from abroad. We pay in USD (U.S. Dollars) by check, mailed 
              via international airmail. It is your responsibility to deposit 
              and convert the funds to a local currency and determine how to best 
              deposit the checks.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">What would be my responsibility as an affiliate? 
              </font> <br>
              All you have to do as an affiliate is place a link (or more) to 
              us on your web page or within your e-mail newsletters. You can also 
              promote the affiliate program to other webmasters to receive additional 
              commission revenue based on their activities. For specifics, read 
              the full adffiliate member <a href="membterms.htm">TERMS</a> for 
              details.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">How do I link to you or put up a subscription 
              form? </font> <br>
              When you are approved, you will be provided with a way of generating 
              several kinds of links, including banners, text links, an integrated 
              form for your site, and a pop-up window (using javascript). Creating 
              the links is easy; we do all the work. All you do is copy and paste 
              them into your HTML or e-mail newsletter.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#0000FF">Can I put more than one link on my site? </font> 
              <br>
              Feel free to use as many links or as many types of links as you 
              feel is optimal. <br>

            <p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica"> <font color="#0000FF">Who 
              is eligible to become an affiliate? </font> <br>
              We will consider any application from a corporation or an individual 
              website, as long as its content meets our requirements (no adult 
              or illegal content). You are not eligible if your content is defamatory 
              or obscene, violates the privacy rights, or promotes sexually explicit 
              materials, violence, illegal activities or any kind of discrimination.

              do I take advantage of the referral program to earn more? </font> 
              <br>
              Once you have been accepted as an affiliate, simply send friends 
              of yours a link to us and tell them your e-mail address. If they 
              apply and are accepted, you will earn $.05 from each valid subscriber

              <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">What about cheaters who try to inflate their 
              subscriber rate with fake subscriptions? </FONT> <BR>
              Subscriptions are made through a double opt-in process. The subscriber 
              will receive a confirmation e-mail which must be responded to in 
              order for the affiliate to receive credit for that subscription. 
              All subscriptions must be entered by the owner of that e-mail address. 
              Cheaters will be warned and then expelled from BRIEFME.COM, losing 
              both revenue and any other benefits.<BR>

              <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">I want more ways to promote myself. How can 
              I participate and gain exposure? </FONT> <BR>
              You can apply to be an <a href="../editor/index.html">editor</a> 
              and contribute reviews/articles every week, or even <a href="../advertise/index.html">advertise</a>.<BR>

              <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">How does BRIEFME.COM track the subscribers 
              that come from members? </FONT> <BR>
              You will have your choice of banners, text links, online form or 
              pop-up window to send BRIEFME subscribers to us. Each of these methods 
              includes your affiliate ID. When a subscription is completed, the 
              referring affiliate member gets credit, regardless of which method 
              was used to get the subscriber to a BRIEFME subscription form.</FONT></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica"> <font color="#0000FF">Can 
              I use e-mail as one of the ways of spreading the word about BRIEFME? 
              </font> <br>
              E-mail is a great way to get people to know about BRIEFME, particularly 
              site newsletters. The text link we will provide will make it easy 
              for you to include a link in an e-mail. So the answer is you may 
              use e-mail, but any e-mail messages referring to BRIEFME must be 
              the result of a requested newsletter and opt-in (i.e., no SPAM). 
              Substantiated SPAM reports are grounds for termination. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica"> <font color="#0000FF">Will 
              you ask for my SS# or Federal Tax ID#? </font> <br>
              Once you get close to $600 in affiliate earnings, we will contact 
              you for your tax ID information. The income you earn is taxable 
              in the U.S., and if it exceeds $600 in the calendar year (in personal 
              income from BRIEFME), we report the amount paid to the IRS. For 
              amounts under $600, you should report the total earnings to the 
              IRS yourself when doing your taxes. If you are not a U.S. resident, 
              you do not need to provide an identification number. <br>
