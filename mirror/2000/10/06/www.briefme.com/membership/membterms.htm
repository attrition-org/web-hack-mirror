            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GENERAL: <br>
              This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, 
              U.S.A. You hereby consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in courts 
              located in New York County, New York, U.S.A. in all disputes arising 
              out of or relating to the use of the BRIEFME System. In addition, 
              you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in 
              such courts for any action commenced by you against BRIEFME (or 
              its affiliates). Use of the BRIEFME System is unauthorized in any 
              jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these 
              terms and conditions, including without limitation this paragraph. 
              You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency 
              relationship exists between you and BRIEFME as a result of this 
              agreement or use of the BRIEFME System. BRIEFME's performance of 
              this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and 
              nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of BRIEFME's 
              right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests 
              or requirements relating to your use of the BRIEFME System or information 
              provided to or gathered by BRIEFME with respect to such use. If 
              any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable 
              pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty 
              disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the 
              invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by 
              a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent 
              of the original provision, and the remainder of the agreement shall 
              continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement 
              constitutes the entire agreement between the user and BRIEFME with 
              respect to the BRIEFME System, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
              communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, 
              between the user and BRIEFME with respect to the BRIEFME System. 
              A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic 
              form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings 
              based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and 
              subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records 
              originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not 
              rent, lease, license, grant a security interest in, or otherwise
