            <p>BRIEFME is such a wonderful "invention"! ... I keep telling friends, 
              family and business associates about it and I know they're getting 
              the newsletter, too - and enjoying it as much as me! <br>
              --Barb Donohue<br>
              <br>
              [As an editor], I am pleased by the *new* traffic we are getting 
              to the FlipSwitch website. Since I began tracking approx 4 weeks 
              ago, we have logged 2300 new visitors. We have also seen the number 
              of subscribers to our 'listbot' newsletter increase. <br>
              --Gary Crumpler<br>
              <br>
              I've enjoyed Briefme very much. ... The concept behind it is terrific. 
              It allows me to scan sites where my interests might be, but where 
              otherwise, I'd probably never look for lack of surfing time. <br>
              --Dwayne Parsons<br>
              <br>
              I enjoy and appreciate being in the position of an editor for your 
              newsletter. The byline that you give your editors has positively 
              impacted my business. <br>
              --Atham Z<br>
              <br>
              Please accept my note of gratitude for the wonderful Newsletters 
              you send me. They are always interesting and chock full of useful 
              information. I especially enjoy the Astrology-Psychic, and Self-Improvement-Psychology 
              letters. With Briefme, I think everyone can find something which 
              interests them. [These are] the best offerings on the Web. Thank 
              you for offering this professionalism and quality to your readers.<br>
              --Jim Hathorn <br>
              <br>
              Thanks so much for the nice review of our new site. ... We appreciate 
              the mention and look forward to receiving our new subscription to 
              Briefme.com. <br>
              --(Mr. & Mrs.) Rod Lopez-Fabrega and Mary Grace Ashcraft<br>
              <br>
              Thank you for publishing my last two articles I submitted to &quot;briefme&quot;. 
              I think you have a brillant idea (for your site), and really thru 
              our efforts you provide a great service to many people. I find that 
              the briefme articles are much more informative than CNET or TRIPOD 
              newsletters. <br>
              --Michael J. Cresci<br>
              <br>
              Just want to say thank you for all the neat stuff you send. I have 
              a ton of fun with most stuff. Peace, <br>
              --Renee Webb<br>
              <br>
              I had an email from one of the sites I referenced last week. He 
              had wondered where the big surge of traffic had come from and had 
              traced it down to the Briefme review. Neat, huh? It works... <br>
              --Graham Marshman<br>
              <br>
              [As an editor], we get traffic from your newsletter, so it is a 
              win-win situation! <br>
              --Meta Davidson<br>
              <br>
              I really enjoy reading the Briefme.com newsletters I receive. They 
              do as intended - tease me into going deeper. Thanks for your efforts! 
              <br>

              Briefme is so good because of [the BRIEFME] staff ... we editors 
              submit the content, but you guys really make sure it's great, and 
              I appreciate that and will suggest Briefme to many others!! <br>
              --Ramon Ray <br>
              <br>
              This is a great idea; opening up excellent sites with fascinating 
              themes and presentations. In addition, I find the reviews very helpful 
              in laying out the promise of each individual site. Please keep them 
              coming. Thank you. <br>
              --Bernard Lee<br>

              BRIEFME lead[s] my reading, in part because its reports are insightful, 
              and in part upbeat, and in part telling me about sites I might enjoy 
              visiting.<br>
              --Edward W. Stollery II<br>
              <br>
              I want to thank you personally for the opportunity to write for 
              BRIEFME. A little history might help you to understand just why 
              this has been such a rewarding experience for me. I have Degenerative 
              Disc Disease, and have had to have 8 fusions on my back. The operations 
              required the implantation of many pieces of hardware (metal screws, 
              plates, wires and rods) into my back. The result--horrible chronic 
              pain. I have been unable to work, because of this issue since October 
              of 1991. I was a Registered Nurse, until this problem required that 
              I stop working at the ripe old age of 31. Since I was required to 
              retire in '91, I have been unable to do anything that I felt was 
              "of purpose." Enter BRIEFME. Writing for BRIEFME has given my life 
              both purpose and direction again. Since starting with BRIEFME, I 
              have created (with my husband) a website that is growing very quickly 
              and am publishing my own newsletter that is affiliated with the 
              website. Now when I get up in the morning I have a purpose, something 
              to do that I consider worthwhile. I have BRIEFME to thank for that. 
              I am very appreciative of the opportunity to write for BRIEFME. 
              ...just thought that you might like to know what a tremendous, positive 
              impact that you, and BRIEFME have had on my life... Thank you.<br>
              --Mary G. Brinkley<br>
              <br>
              I really love the BRIEFME reviews. There are just too many sites 
              out there, and as a business owner, I do not have the time or energy 
              to find them. Of all of the e-mail I get, I always make sure I read 
              the BRIEFME reviews.<br>
              --Gail Mayhugh<br>
              <br>
              I just wanted to inform BRIEFME staff and readers that my tenure 
              as a Contributing Editor helped me to secure a position as an Editorial 
              Assistant at the CLC WEB--an academic, online journal specializing 
              in comparative literature and cultural studies. I suspect that out 
              of all the possible applicants from around the world, my tenure 
              at BRIEFME put me in particularly good stead, and was a major (if 
              not decisive) factor in helping me to secure this position. Whilst 
              my academic background no doubt played a role, BRIEFME not only 
              made my application stand out from the crowd, it helped prepare 
              me for the ensuing responsibility and demands. So, thank you BRIEFME--I 
              look forward to continuing to write for Allison Conner in particular, 
              and welcome the opportunity to one day displace her as editor in 
              chief (I obviously have my work cut out for me).<br>
              --Steven Aoun<br>
              <br>
              Just wanted to let you know that your BRIEFME e-mails are fantastic. 
              They're the one type of e-mail subscription I have that I always 
              look forward to receiving.Thank you--you have no idea how helpful 
              they are!<br>
              --Roger Viola<br>
              <br>
              I am thrilled that I have had several articles chosen for BRIEFME. 
              Just wanted to say that I am so pleased and glad to be on board 
              ... Love doing this and thanks!<br>
