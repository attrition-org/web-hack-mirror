<br><b>Hacked By Neon-Lenz</b>
<br>Another admin who needs to get educated in Computer-Security.....
<br>Pretty funny stuff actually, this webserver was actually hosting <b>Cisco</b>
<br>Courses!! Pretty unbelievable eh ? But well if you wanna see it, click
<br><a href="index.bak">here</a> to continue
to the original website. Admin your index.html has
<br>been renamed to index.bak.
<p>Nothing was damaged during this hack, i've only deleted the logs. For
more
<br>info about the vulnerability and the fix, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">neonlenz@hushmail.com</a>.
<br>I've also created a text-file called "hints.txt" in your %systemroot%\system32.
<br>Check that one for some info written by me on how to secure your IIS
server.
<p><b>PcAnyscan</b>
<br>PcAnyscan, a little tool (more like a script) coded by to make your
life a bit easier.
<br>It probes by using the nc.exe (NetCat executable) for PcAnywhere ports.
It saves you
<br>some typing and some time scanning till your portscanner reaches the
65301th port.
<br>Yes i know nmap and netcat have their own functions to do this but
still you need to type
<br>a lot more shit to do a scan when using their functions). Just <b>Pcanyscan
&lt;ip></b>, et voila ! 8)
<p>Download <a href="http://packetstorm.securify.com/Win/Pcanyscan.exe">PcAnyscan</a>
(Pcanyscan.exe)
<br>Download <a href="http://npcdh.hypermart.net/nc.exe">nc.exe</a> (NetCat
Executable)
<p>Note: You have to put them under the same directory, otherwise they
will NOT work.
<p><b>Funny stuff</b>
<br>If you want a good laugh, and you know Dutch (if not look for a translator)
visit the
<br>following <a href="http://www.security.nl/content.php3?page=reactie&id=1491">link</a>.
The forum subject is about a dutch "l33t hax0r" called Gerrie Mansur,
<br>he was on TV few days ago and he screwed it up. He was going to show
us his
<br>Nasdaq hacking skills, umm is he ????????? 8)
<p><b>Hitler Crew:</b>
<br>Don't waste your time with your silly hacks, the only feedback you
probably would
<br>get are our middle fingers and some flames to burn yer stinky nazi-asses.
Comprendre ?
<p><b>Greets to:</b>
<br>Tribunal, Herbless, Fux0r, G-Force Pakistan, nexus (the one who doesn't
re-deface),
<br>Ne[r0, electr0n, dislexik (nice meeting u bud), pr|est (yo still waiting
for your e-mail),
<br>F0kus, Zyvr and to everyone who doesn't redeface.
<p><b>To re-defacers:</b>
<br>Argh.. re-defacers, get a life and stop re-defacing. You're not <b>only</b>
annoying the hackers,
<br>but you're also annoying the various hacked mirrors (attrition, alldas,
haxordot). At
<br>least do it for them. If you have respect for the hacked archives,
that is.
<p>Well enough bullshit for today, where do you want to go <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">tomorrow</a>
? 8)
