Look at what we have here.  Another box rooted by Slacker.

I don't mean to get off on a rant here but this is only the begining.  The begining of something great.  Gnu-Kids were once a very great group of people and then two of the founders got raided and several members were being watched.  We shut-down for our own safety.  We shut-down in <b>fear</b>.  But why fear you?  All you know is what your pathetic log files tell you.  Well your log files won't tell you that I got root on this computer.  Your log files won't tell you that the Gnu-Kids will be back.  Your log files won't tell you that you're next.
