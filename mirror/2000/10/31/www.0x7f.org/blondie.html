                        Editor's Note: Computer hacking - once the
                        shadowy domain of misfits, pranksters
                        techno-critics and spies - has taken center stage.
                        While Y2K "czar" John Koskinen pleads
                        publicly with hackers to cease and desist
                        during the century date-change, reports
                        escalate daily of cyber-terrorism threats and
                        malevolent computer viruses embedded in
                        e-mail, timed to activate on Jan. 1. 

                        But there is another side to hacking. 

                        WorldNetDaily's roving international
                        correspondent, Anthony C. LoBaido, while
                        enduring seven weeks of one of Hong Kong's
                        hottest summers on record, was allowed into
                        the secret realm of one of the world's leading
                        computer hacking organizations.

                        HONG KONG --
                        What do blondes,
                        Jack in the Box tacos
                        and 21st century
                        cyber-warfare have in
                        common? Everything, apparently, if you're one
                        of the elite and stealthy soldiers in Hong Kong
                        Blondes' computer hacking universe. 

                        These committed soldiers are locked in mortal
                        combat with the government of the People's
                        Republic of China and the transnational
                        corporations who profit from dealing with it. 

                        "Human rights are a global concern and we
                        have no second thoughts about attacking the
                        multinational corporations who profit off of the
                        human rights abuses committed against our
                        Chinese brothers and sisters by their own
                        government," says Databyte Cowgirl, one of
                        the leaders of the Hong Kong Blondes. 

                        Along with numerous other members of the
                        Hong Kong Blondes, Databyte Cowgirl was
                        interviewed by WorldNetDaily over the course
                        of seven weeks in July and August of 1999, as
                        well as during the past several weeks. 

                        "The Chinese government officials are just as
                        bad as the Nazis. Only, for some reason, the
                        multinational corporations find China and
                        other communist regimes around the world to
                        be more politically digestible," she added. 

                        "The gross human rights violations of the
                        Chinese leadership, like the logai gulag
                        system, religious persecution, forced organ
                        harvesting, abortion and the crackdown on the
                        Falong Gong Tai Chi movement are the
                        epitome of evil. The only way we have to fight
                        against them is via the high-tech realm." 

                        The story of the Hong Kong Blondes is a
                        fascinating, twisted tale, stranger than fiction. 

                        To begin, the group was formed by the
                        infamous (to the communist Chinese
                        dictatorship) or renowned (to computer
                        "hackers" the world over) Blondie Wong.
                        Although his name is unfamiliar to the general
                        public of both American and China, Blondie
                        Wong is a man who is well known to the
                        Chinese government, the People's Liberation
                        Army, the National Security Agency of the U.S.,
                        the CIA, FBI, Interpol and numerous Fortune
                        500 companies. 

                        Although he now lives in exile in Toronto,
                        Canada, under the protection of armed
                        bodyguards, as a young boy Blondie Wong
                        saw his beloved father stoned to death by
                        Chairman Mao's Red Guards during the
                        Cultural Revolution. Years later he traveled to
                        the United Kingdom, where he entered
                        university and studied to become a teacher. In
                        the summer of 1989, after witnessing the
                        Tienanmen Square massacre on television,
                        Blondie Wong decided to form the Hong Kong
                        Blondes and their sister hacking group, the
                        Yellow Pages. 

                        At first, Wong started small -- organizing a
                        close circle of friends he believed he could
                        trust. Later he launched an international
                        recruiting campaign aimed at some of the
                        finest computer engineering universities in
                        America and around the world. 

                        Ranging from Cal Tech to MIT, Blondie Wong
                        assembled an elite army of sympathetic
                        hackers. Young men and women who only a
                        few short years before had been high school
                        geeks with thick glasses and pocket protectors
                        now became the front line of attack against the
                        communist Chinese government. 

                        They pledged allegiance to Blondie Wong's
                        crusade against communist China and turned
                        their collective computer science and
                        engineering skills into a sharp spear. Within a
                        few months, this spear was capable of
                        penetrating the internal affairs of China's
                        military industrial complex, as well as the
                        Western transnational corporations that do
                        business with China. 

                        "One of the reasons that human rights in China
                        are not further ahead is because they have been
                        de-linked from American trade policy," Wong
                        said in a document released through Cult of
                        the Dead Cow, a U.S.-based hacker group that
                        has advised the Blondes on technical issues. 

                        "When human rights considerations were
                        associated with doing business with the United
                        States, at least there was the threat of losing
                        trade relations, of some form of punishment.
                        Now this just doesn't exist. Beijing successfully
                        went around Congress and straight to
                        American business, so in effect, businessmen
                        started dictating foreign policy," Wong
                        explained. 

                        "By taking the side of profit over conscience,
                        business has set our struggle back so far that
                        they have become our oppressors too," Wong
                        said. 

                        To deal with their oppressors, the Blondes
                        began reading the private email of
                        multinational executives and People's
                        Liberation Army officers. They downloaded
                        secure information such as satellite access
                        codes, and even produced forged credentials
                        giving Hong Kong and mainland colleagues
                        access to People's Liberation Army facilities. 

                        Closer to home in Hong Kong, the Blondes
                        began meeting at a local Jack in the Box
                        restaurant, where they would munch on tacos
                        while exchanging customized diagnostic
                        software tools with one another. These tools
                        were used to launch attacks against the PLA's
                        computer systems through DoS or "Denial of
                        Service" - in which a system is overloaded with
                        millions of "hits" on a website. Other attack
                        modes include erasing important data, altering
                        and planting disinformation, and "spoofing" or
                        attacking the processor of a computer network
                        so as to gain root privileges -- the ability to
                        execute commands and functions -- within the
                        PLA network. 

                        As time progressed, members of the Hong
                        Kong Blondes leadership told WorldNetDaily
                        they began actually to install codes within the
                        PLA computer mainframes. By using cellular
                        modems, they were able to monitor the
                        electromagnetic signals emitted by PLA
                        computers by remote means. The Blondes even
                        planted transmitters within the offices of the
                        Chinese government, People's Liberation Army
                        and foreign corporate headquarters in order to
                        monitor their activities and infiltrate their
                        computer networks. 

                        For those who doubt Blondie Wong's legions
                        and capabilities, the group, as if to prove itself,
                        temporarily disabled a key People's Liberation
                        Army military satellite. Several PLA military
                        officers questioned by WorldNetDaily in Hong
                        Kong confirmed this intrusion. 

                        In fact, the Chinese government and military
                        officially recognized the unauthorized attack
                        on their hardened, restricted systems in a press
                        release. 

                        "In 1999, there were 228 cyber-attacks launched
                        within Hong Kong, in 1998, there were only
                        34," said Lo Yik Kee, chief superintendent of
                        the newly formed Police Computer Crime
                        Bureau, which will start operations on January
                        1, 2000. 

                        "We've seen a large increase in hacking
                        incidents and due to the transnational nature of
                        this kind of activity, it will only increase in the
                        future." 

                        The Jack in the Box restaurant where the Hong
                        Kong Blondes used to meet was closed down,
                        putting an end to the group's taco fests. Yet, the
                        space was renovated into an Internet café, from
                        which the group first launched its PLA
                        infiltrations. Since then, the cyber cafe, which
                        stood near the TST subway station on Hong
                        Kong Island, has been closed down as well.
                        But the hacking unit formed by Blondie Wong
                        continues to grow. 

                        According to China's Ministry of Public
                        Security, there were 72,000 cyber-attacks
                        launched against the PLA on mainland Chinese
                        soil in the first nine months of this year. Of
                        those, 165 were admitted to have been
                        "successful." 

                        A spokesman for the National Security Agency
                        in Washington, D.C. told WorldNetDaily that
                        there are "less than 1,100 recognized hacking
                        experts worldwide." Blondie Wong and his
                        followers definitely appear to be included in
                        that number. 

                        "The PLA is about to launch a fourth division
                        of its military," said Ashton Tyler Baines in a
                        recent interview with WorldNetDaily. A
                        London-born computer programmer who now
                        lives in the New Territories north of Kowloon
                        Island in the Hong Kong Special
                        Administrative Region, Baines has been a
                        member of the Hong Kong Blondes for the past
                        two years. 

                        "The PLA wants to control the cyberspace of its
                        enemies, while at the same time preventing
                        attacks on its own cyberspace," she explained. 

                        Baines told WorldNetDaily that the Hong
                        Kong Blondes and the Yellow Pages have
                        "already placed over 40 social engineers
                        [computer operators who act as moles for the
                        Blondes] inside the PLA's newly created
                        cyberspace division." 

                        "The PLA is in for a rude awakening. We can
                        infiltrate, alter and even crash several of their
                        networks. We're putting in backdoors. We're
                        writing bad code into the CD-ROMs they use
                        as backups for their off-line servers. We have
                        already infected the backup off-site copies of
                        their CD-ROMs. We understand most of their
                        security protocols because we wrote most of
                        them into the software," she added. 

                        As one would expect, the Hong Kong Blondes
                        are a secretive group who depend totally on
                        the honor of their members. Yet their leaders
                        told WorldNetDaily they "encourage other
                        interested parties to form their own hacking
                        groups." 

                        The Hong Kong Blondes won't disclose the
                        numbers on their membership roster for two
                        reasons. Primary, of course, is concern for the
                        security of their members. But the Blondes also
                        admit they aren't exactly sure just how many
                        elite hackers around the world have aligned
                        themselves with their agenda. 

                        "Ironically, we follow Chairman Mao's dictates
                        of warfare. We are organized into small cells
                        which are independent of one another. Cut off
                        one head of a cell, and another will emerge in
                        its place," said Baines. 

                        "Anyone can join our cyber army. The goals
                        and objectives are clear and well known in
                        underground hacking circles. First, infiltrate
                        the PLA -- their communications satellites,
                        space program and supercomputers, which can
                        perform billions of operations in a single
                        second. Second, the multinational corporations
                        who are feeding the PLA weapons frenzy.
                        Third, we like to go after COSCO (the Chinese
                        Overseas Shipping Company) which is nothing
                        more than a front for the PLA to acquire the
                        financial muscle it needs to expand and
                        threaten Free Asia and the West." 

                        According to Databyte Cowgirl, the Blondes
                        and the Yellow Pages are also targeting the
                        financial operations of Ted Turner's CNN and
                        his Atlanta Braves Baseball team, as well as
                        transnational companies "like Coca-Cola who
                        do business with the Islamic jihad government
                        of Sudan." She was referring to the Sudanese
                        "holy war" that has resulted in the deaths of
                        millions of black South Sudanese Christians
                        since 1983. 

                        Additional targets include AT&T's new Lucent
                        Technologies, which will handle future
                        "cashless" transactions over the telephone, and
                        the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa
                        corporation, the latter with known ties to the
                        People's Liberation Army. Hutchison Wampoa
                        is due to take over the operation of the
                        strategically vital Panama Canal in the year
                        2000. 

                        "It's high time we began attacking the money
                        the elite has stashed away by arming the PLA
                        and profiting on the suffering of the Chinese
                        people," said Baines. 

                        "Banking, stocks, bonds, IRAs, gold bullion,
                        money transfers, pension accounts and
                        everything else you can think of. If the CIA can
                        go after the bank accounts of (Serbian
                        President) Milosevich, then we can go after the
                        private bank accounts of China-lovers like
                        Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright.
                        Kissinger makes millions of dollars every year
                        speaking and lobbying on behalf of Western
                        multinational engagement with China. That's
                        blood money on his hands and we intend to
                        take it back -- so he'd better be hiding his
                        money under his mattress." 

                        Tracey Kinchen, a former M1-5 agent with
                        British Intelligence, assists the Hong Kong
                        Blondes and the Yellow Pages with acquiring
                        fake travel credentials and other sensitive
                        items needed for international travel. Kinchen
                        brings three qualities to the Hong Kong
                        Blondes which its members claim are
                        indispensible. First, she is the group's only
                        natural blonde. Second, she is the spitting
                        image of Hollywood actress Julie Holden.
                        Third, and most importantly they say, she
                        loves Jack in the Box tacos. 

                        In an interview with WorldNetDaily conducted
                        at the World Trade Center in Bangkok,
                        Thailand, Kinchen spelled out the reasons she
                        supports the Hong Kong Blondes' efforts. 

                        "Blondie Wong and the Hong Kong Blondes
                        would never want to hurt anyone. They follow
                        Ghandi's and Martin Luther King's worldview
                        of non-violence," she told WorldNetDaily. 

                        "But they also understand that the nature of
                        warfare has changed. Who could have known
                        that the supercomputers the Pentagon only
                        dreamed about a half century ago would one
                        day become home appliances capable of the
                        most high-tech industrial espionage?" 

                        Kinchen said that information technology is the
                        "refuge of last resort" and the "perfect medium
                        to conduct low intensity warfare." 

                        "The NSA's budget is eight times larger than
                        the CIA's. They handle most of the intelligence
                        workload. Yet, with all of their state of the art
                        equipment they haven't been able to touch
                        Blondie Wong, or any of us for that matter." 

                        While maintaining strict loyalty to Blondie
                        Wong and his compatriot, the shadowy Lemon
                        Li who lives in exile in St Nazare, France, the
                        Hong Kong Blondes and the Yellow Pages are
                        rapidly expanding. 

                        In addition to cells at Cal Tech and MIT, the
                        group has set up new cells at Baylor, Texas
                        A&M, West Point, Liberty Baptist -- and the Air
                        Force Academy in Colorado. 

                        "Our movement is a lot like witchcraft in
                        colonial Salem," said Michael Ming, a
                        Chinese-born computer science student at
                        Texas A&M University in College Station,
                        Texas. 

                        "Most people assume "The Crucible" version of
                        unjust witch hunts in Salem is the truth. But I
                        believe witchcraft was real and powerful in
                        Salem. Not because of the witches, but because
                        the general population believed that it had real
                        power. As long as the PLA knows we're out
                        there, we'll be agitating them and taking away
                        their comfort zone." 

                        Ming added, "Now that the NSA, Echelon and
                        PLA understand that we have a virtually
                        undetectable, un-infiltratable, loose-knit
                        organization with total allegiance to Blondie
                        Wong and his goals, we're going to become
                        even more of a threat to them. Even if they
                        found us and took us out, thousands would
                        rise up to take our places. Even the PLA can't
                        kill that fast." 

                        The Hong Kong Blondes recently presented
                        this WorldNetDaily reporter with a large
                        mahogany replica of Noah's Ark, complete
                        with 500 animal and people pieces. The ark
                        was hewn by persecuted priests who languish
                        inside the boundaries of mainland China. 

                        This band of anarchists, snoops, humanists,
                        Christians, Buddhists and blondes, both real
                        and imagined, has united in pursuit of a
                        common goal -- to "fight the powers that be" by
                        "hacking the planet." 

                        This reporter recently said goodbye to the
                        Hong Kong Blondes' Thailand-based cell at the
                        "Pam Pam" restaurant in Bangkok's World
                        Trade Center. Pam Pam is the innocuous name
                        given to Thailand's newest Jack in the Box
                        franchise. The restaurant's menu features every
                        item Jack in the Box lovers crave, from curly
                        fries to sourdough burgers. Conspicuously
                        absent are the tacos. 

                        Yet, hanging on the walls of Pam Pam's
                        restaurant are giant pictures of the beloved
                        tacos. And just below those pictures sit a neat
                        row of state of the art computers, just waiting
                        for the birth of a new Hong Kong Blondes cell. 

                        Hack the planet.
