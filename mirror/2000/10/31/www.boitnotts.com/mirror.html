        Each step is pain. The knife edge cuts first into the balls of your
        feet, then slices through the soft sinews and the bone up to the deepest
        arch of your sole. With each new foothold, the gleaming blade cleaves a
        little deeper or lacerates you in a new place. The warm blood -- your
        blood -- bursts out of ruptured veins and dribbles down the sides of the
        bridge, its carmine trails forking and crossing the ferruginous traces
        left by previous travelers. Bones in your feet fracture with a snapping
        report as you steady yourself for the next step. Each crack echoes off
        the walls of the abyss. You dare not scream, because to scream is to
        lose hope and to lose hope is to fall. The sweat-provoking incalescence
        and low rumbling of the pit below remind you of the fate of the lost.
        You lift your back foot gingerly and then take the next purgatorial
        step....</font></td>

      <td width="100%"><b>This was taken in 1985 just before Christmas. The
        experience of a family of 7 were many, but here are the most memorable.
        My dad built the house in the `50s, so only we lived there, but the
        house was always haunted. It had a sense of foreboding that never left.
        Our dogs often stared, growled, and bristled their hair, eyes following
        something we could not see. My sister lay in bed one night and heard
        chains and growling dogs running back and forth from window to window
        outside her room. She ran out terrified. She woke up one morning to see
        our dead grandpa standing at the foot of her bed, smiling. Doors opened,
        there were cold spots, unexplained noises, odors, lights going on at all
        hours, washer and dryer coming on at 3 a.m.</b>
        <p><b>My dad had a 30 foot boat trailored out in the yard thats engine
        would suddenly roar into life late at night. Once my dad was yanked out
        of his bed by the ankles. His screams woke my mother who found him wide
        eyed on the floor. I was grabbed, hard, in the sides and tickled while I
        was in bed. It hurt and I was swinging my arms trying to hit whoever it
        was, and my arms just swung thru the air hitting nothing, yet the
        tickling continued. It was so hard it was lifting me off the bed. I
        thought it'd never stop, but finally it did. My parents often came home
        to find us kids sitting out front waiting for them to come home because
        we had been scared out of the house. We heard footsteps, and things
        often turned up missing, only to reappear later in a most obvious place.
        Toilets often flushed with a jiggling of the handle just to be sure. The
        picture told us what we already knew, we had a ghost.</b>
        <p><b>A physic told my folks our home was cursed and they had it
        blessed. But &quot;it&quot; became more active. Years ago we tried a
        Ouija board. We asked if a</b> <b>spirit haunted our home. It said yes,
        but would give no further information. My folks tried the board alone,
        and whatever it said terrified them. They threw the board away and
        refuse to tell what it told them. They said &quot;they forgot&quot;. We
        know now leave those boards alone! Even though we no longer live in
        Largo, my parents still experience paranormal phenomenon as did I in my
        home (that story you have) (Haunting in my home 8-1-98). I often wonder
        if it is all connected. Who knows. Thank you for your interest.</b></p>
        <p><b>A film expert said the face is not a flection or camera error. He
        said whatever &quot;it&quot; is, it is behind the glass with the picture
        of Christ, and has its' own light source lighting up its face. He asked
        that we never bring film to him to be developed again. He was that
        scared.</b></td>

      (The Sun, 12986)</u></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>A simple Ouija board became a passport to Hell for a family that accidently summoned a demon into their living room. "I thought it might have been the Devil himself," says John Ravens, father of the tormented family. "When it was over, we were all bleeding and had severe burn marks. Our living room was a disaster area."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      "It was supposed to be a joke," says Gloria, the girl's mother. "We were going to make believe we were talking with the spirit world."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Little Lynda, her nine-year-old brother Ronald, and their parents gathered around the board for what they thought was going to be an evening of fun at their home in a Toronto, Canada suburb. "We were just playing around with it when suddenly the planchette that spells out answers began moving by itself," says John. "We were all scared, but then I thought maybe one of the kids was up to tricks. We started asking questions, and this spirit began speaking to us. "Then it asked if it could visit with us. By this time, I was sure someone was playing a joke, and I said yes," he adds.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      That's when the nightmare began. "The demon appeared within seconds," says John. "It spun around the room overhead, laughing and cursing at us. "It was surrounded by a ring of fire and the room became so hot, it was like an inferno from Hell." The family describes the demon as red and black with scaly skin and horns. It also had giant bat wings. "Then it suddenly swooped down and attacked us," recalls John, horror flickering over his features. "It started biting each of us on the face and arms. "We tried getting up and running for the door, but every time we did, the creature started clawing us. It was so fast, we couldn't escape from it."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Lynda and brother Ronald were picked up repeatedly and hurled across the room. As they lay helplessly on the floor, the creature pounded on their chests and heads. "It had hooves that dug into my children's faces and skin, marking them badly," says Gloria. The attack lasted for more than an hour before the horrifying demon vanished as quickly as it first appeared. The children were screaming and crying as John pulled them out of the house and drove to a nearby hospital, where they were treated for cuts and burns.</b>&nbsp;</td>
