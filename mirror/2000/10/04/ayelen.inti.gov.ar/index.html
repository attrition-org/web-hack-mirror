<!-- Fucks go to: dumbass Sneed, dumbass 80m (80 morons for those that don't konw), Ti|| deserves a big fuck you! He's posting false claims of things people say. He's trying to act like he's elite or some shit by talking shit about someone else. He's talking shit about pimpshiz, myself and has threightened to talk shit about others, however lame that sounds. He's taking 'documentaion' of what other people and I say, then he puts the senteces on a webpage, scrambled up so no one knows how much of loser he really is, trying to make that person look stupid. Ti|| is in this group called RTFM (Retards That Fuck Monkeys) and he's upset because he can't deface, so he talks shit about other people that can/do deface. 
And fuck everyone else that deserves a fuck, you dumb fucks. --!>
