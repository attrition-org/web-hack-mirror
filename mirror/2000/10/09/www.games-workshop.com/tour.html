This is the introduction tour. Throughout thetour there are numerous links to follow and explore more thoroughly, butfor your first time we recommend reading straight through. If you follow a link and want to get back to the tour,just look for your friendly Orc Tour Guide.</FONT> </P><P><IMG SRC="tour/ultramarines.jpeg" HEIGHT=204 WIDTH=303 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=+1>Thehobby starts when you pick up your first Citadel Miniature. From thereyou can try painting your model, then move on to collecting more of thearmy you like and playing a game.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>A WORLD IN A BOX</FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Games Workshop boxed games are packed full with miniatures(two different armies), complete rules, templates, dice, and everythingyou'll need to play your first game. Any flat surface becomes the battlefieldwhere you and your opponent march and maneuver with vast armies of CitadelMiniatures in a challenging test of skill and tactics, but the hobby doesn'tend there...</FONT></P><CENTER><P><IMG SRC="tour/tabletop.gif" ALT="Tabletop Battlegames" HEIGHT=159 WIDTH=269 ALIGN=RIGHT><B><FONT SIZE=+2>EXPANDYOUR FORCES</FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The excitement and fun of a tightly contested battle isjust the start of the Games Workshop Hobby. As your experience grows you'llwant to expand your forces with new troops, war machines, and more. Butremember, as your army grows, so will that of your opponents.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="tour/painting.html">PAINT YOUR OWNARMY</A></FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="tour/painting.html">Painting Citadel Miniatures</A>is a big part of the Games Workshop Hobby, and nothing will bring a tabletopbattlefield to life like a well-painted army of Citadel Miniatures. Ifyou've never painted a model before, and you're not sure how you'll do- don't worry. We always <IMG SRC="tour/archers.jpeg" ALT="Bretonnian Archers in various color schemes" HEIGHT=189 WIDTH=271 ALIGN=LEFT>saythat if you can write with a pen you'll be able to paint our miniaturesto a good gaming standard. By using a few simple to learn techniques, likedrybrushing and applying washes, you'll soon have an army to be proud of.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="tour/terrain.html">STUNNING GAME TERRAIN</A></FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Your first few games will probably be played on a flattabletop (like the kitchen table!), but many players can't resist the urgeto create their own <A HREF="tour/terrain.html">world of scenery</A>, withwoods, hills, rivers, and buildings. Not only does terrain vary the lookof your battlefields, but it will also add new tactical challenges to yourgames. Whether it is a unit of Wood Elves marching through the forest tosurprise an opponent, or a squad of Space Marines taking cover amidst therubble of a destroyed building, scenery opens up whole new strategies foryour games.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><A HREF="whitedwarf.html"><IMG SRC="tour/dwarf.gif" ALT="White Dwarf Magazine #205" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=164 WIDTH=124 ALIGN=RIGHT></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="whitedwarf.html">WHITEDWARF MAGAZINE</A></FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Games Workshop Hobby is more than any one aspect -it is about gaming, collecting Citadel Miniatures, painting your models,and making terrain for your armies to battle over. At the center of allaspects of the hobby is White Dwarf Magazine. Each month Games Workshoppublishes White Dwarf, and we pack it full of new rules, game tactics,painting tips, modelling workshops, and battle reports for all our games.White Dwarf also gives you the latest news, including game developmentand all the latest Citadel Miniatures. As Games Workshop comes out withnew releases almost every week, White Dwarf is the key in keeping up todate!</FONT></P><CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?</FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The absolute best way for you and your friends to learnmore about the Games Workshop Hobby is to stop by a Games Workshop or aChapter Approved store. Not only can you find everything you'll need forthe gaming hobby, but much more besides. All Games Workshop and U.S. ChapterApproved stores run special gaming and miniature painting events, as wellas introduction games for beginners. If you aren't sure where to find thenearest store stocking Games Workshop products, we can send you a completelisting of all the stores carrying Games Workshop merchandise throughoutthe World, or you could look in the <A HREF="stores.html">How to Find OurGames Section.</A></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>We'd rather you get to a store or shop that has a selectionof our products so you can see the whole range of Citadel Miniatures inperson, and maybe even see a game in progress, or try your hand at an introductionbattle. Unfortunately there are still some areas with no local stores.In this case we heartily recommend the <A HREF="mailorder.html">Games WorkshopMail Order Service</A>, which can provide you with all the latest gamesand Citadel Miniatures.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>WHY THE LAPTOP WILL NEVER RIVAL THE TABLETOP!</FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>To really understand the hobby and Games Workshop gamesyou've got to get a chance to play! Since you've found us on the web, thiswill prove a bit of difficulty. In our own stores, or in Chapter Approvedshops in the U.S. (or better gaming shops anywhere!) you<IMG SRC="tour/perrys.jpeg" ALT="Mike and Alan Perry" HEIGHT=267 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=LEFT>could merely mention to staff that you're interested in playing and theywould arrange a quick intro battle so you could check things out. Afterall, playing is a much better format to show you how fun the games are,as opposed to just telling you about them!</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>If you've never held a painted Citadel Miniature in yourhand, or had a whole army of brightly painted models at your command, thenyou just haven't experienced the <IMG SRC="tour/darkreaper.jpeg" ALT="An Eldar Dark Reaper" HEIGHT=155 WIDTH=125 ALIGN=RIGHT>GamesWorkshop Hobby.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whether you are interested in commanding a squad of heavilyarmored Space Marines in the grim future of Warhammer 40,000, or directingthe action of a green horde of rampaging Orcs and Goblins in the fantasysetting of Warhammer, the Games Workshop Hobby really will bring all theaction right onto your tabletop!</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>This introduction tour has basic information on all aspectsof the hobby and links that you can follow to find our more about the areasthat interest you most.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><IMG SRC="tour/lefay.jpeg" ALT="Morgiana le Fay" HEIGHT=152 WIDTH=168 ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=+2>GETTINGTHE MOST OUT OF THE WEB!</FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>From the main page you can enter anywhere you'd like togo in the Games Workshop Universe.
