The selection and level of craftsmanship of Citadel Miniaturesis unmatched! These are not just any miniatures - these are finely sculptedmodels, right down to the finest detail! </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because they look so great, some people just choose tobuy and collect Citadel Miniatures, but they are sculpted to be paintedand collected in armies. These great looking gaming pieces will rewardcareful painting, and will make a great looking display while they waitfor their next battle. In order to build up vast armies to play Warhammerand Warhammer 40,000, Citadel Miniatures makes a huge selection of differentmodels in both pewter and plastic, ranging from troopers, to heroes, warmachines and vehicles. There are literally thousands upon thousands ofdifferent models to choose from, and every month Games Workshop comes outwith brand new Citadel Miniatures. Citadel Miniatures are not toys, anddue to their small size are not intended for small children.</FONT></P><P><IMG SRC="miniatures/plasticsquad.jpeg" ALT="A Squad of Plastic Chaos Space Marines" HEIGHT=141 WIDTH=330 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=+1>CitadelMiniatures come in a variety of different forms. Pictured at right is aunit of Chaos Space Marines, composed entirely of plastic models. The plasticsare so detailed that it is almost impossible to detect their differencefrom pewter models until you pick them up and the lighter weight of theplastic gives them away!</FONT></P><P><IMG SRC="miniatures/dreadnought.jpeg" ALT="An Eldar Wraithlord" HEIGHT=282 WIDTH=139 ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=+2>EldarWraithlord</FONT></B></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some Citadel Miniatures, like this Eldar Wraithlord,come in blister packs or boxed sets and will need a degree of modelling skill to assemble.This particular Wraithlord model is composed entirely of pewter, and armedwith a Starcannon. Many boxed sets and blister packs, come withoptional parts - in this case, the Wraithlord comes with several differentweapons, so players can decide which of the various deadly armaments theywant to equip their model with.</FONT></P><CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Leman Russ Battle Tank</FONT></B></P></CENTER><P><IMG SRC="miniatures/lemanruss.jpeg" ALT="Leman Russ" HEIGHT=209 WIDTH=307 ALIGN=RIGHT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is the nigh unstoppable Leman Russ - the main battletank of the Imperial Guard.
