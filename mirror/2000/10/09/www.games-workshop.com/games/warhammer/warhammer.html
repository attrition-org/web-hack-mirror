As the commander of the Bretonnian army you will have at your disposal 12
Knights of the Realm - pledged to the service of the Lady of the Lake,
upholding knightly virtues in her name. Alongside the knights you also
have 24 bowmen, some of the finest archers in Bretonnia. Now you are ready

If you choose to fight with the Lizardmen you'll have 32 Skink
archers. These scaly-skinned fighters are not the strongest warriors but
they make up for that with sheer numbers, speed and cunning. You also have
20 Saurus warriors - brutish and savage creatures with extremely tough
scaly skin. Both are driven by a hunger for world domination, guided by
their bloated masters - the Slann.</font></p></center>
