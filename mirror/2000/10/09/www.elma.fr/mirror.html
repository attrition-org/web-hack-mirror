  <font size="2"><i><font color="#FFFFFF">The interpreter showed us one particularly 
  ghastly picture--a depiction of a very, undernourished old man, dangling from 
  a barbed-wire fence. This poor soul, according to the guide, had committed suicide 
  by electrocuting himself on the fence. Just when I thought I had seen enough, 
  I discovered something even more disquieting--pictures of children and more 
  children, all wearing black and white striped uniforms and huddling piteously 
  behind coils of cruel barbed-wire. Children, why children? What possible threat 
  could mere kids have been? I stared in disbelief. </font></i></font> <a href="http://www.holocaustforgotten.com/journey.htm" target="_blank">Ron

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>* The jew crew? [</b>consists so far of, pr|est, dislexik, 
  neon-lenz.. join us!<b>]</b><br>
  <b><br>
  </b>Yeah, the jew crew is a merge of a couple of people who had enough of the 
  hitler crew their sadness.. It's rather pathetic to praise a man<br>
  that caused so much damage, entire families are still suffering about it.. This 
  man, killed thousands, if not millions of innocent people on the<br>
  most inhuman ways.. Think of gaschambers, where people got gassed to death, 
  killed by &quot;medical&quot; experiments, etc.. This all because of their<br>
  relegion, race, sexual preferences.. In this &quot;man's&quot; eyes, he was 
  creating a better world for the germans..<br>
  We should consider ourselves lucky that probably none of us was born already.. 
  <br>
  It kinda seems that the Hitler crew thinks the opposite of this.. I just dont 
  have any words for this... All i can say is, <i>sad sad people</i>.. go get 
  a<br>
  life.. You wont get any fame with this.. All you'll get is hate... I'll be happy 
  to see the feds busting your ass.. And put you in a gas chamber,<br>
  to let you guys feel the same, as the people in the concentration camps did 
  60 years ago.. And by the way, at least Hitler dared to reveal his<br>
  name and shout he was a nazi.. You guys dont even give out nicks.. I think that 
  deep in your hearts you know, you are making no sense at all..<br>
  <br>
  I want to say thanks for the people that support us, and want to spread the 
  word of the jew crew... email me, pr|est, at uberl33t@usa.net<br>
  </font><br>
  <br>
  pr|est, proud to be a jew crew member...</p>
