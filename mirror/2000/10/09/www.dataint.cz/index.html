<font face="Courier New">Yet, this seems like a meaningless defacement,
I've already said congratulations to you on your birthday. However, It seems that I could
have done more. It feels like I was a bit of a jerk, not even giving you a hug before I
left, I'm really sorry for that. I'll be different the next time. Anyway, I was about to
buy you something but you didn't wan't anything, if I ever give you gifts, don't think I
do it because I wan't you to &quot;like&quot; me, that's not the reason, I just wan't you
to be happy. </font>

<p align="center"><strong><font face="Courier New">Anyway, I just wanted to say
congratulations to my lovely &amp; best friend Tove which has a birthday today! She's so
wonderful and always makes me smile, too bad we can't meet eachother every day...You can't
believe how much you mean to me. I'll always be there for you, however the story ends, Much love to you...</font></strong>
