NT-box 0wn3d by me, this website was NOT hacked using a known exploit,
it was hacked using a 0-day exploit which i have founded on my own. I'll
explain a bit more about this. It is a input validation attack which takes
advantage out of a sample script located in the public directory. The sample
script i am talking about, allows you to view and download any file of
the webserver, incl. passwords, database files, configuration files etc.
(And no, it's not showcode.asp, codebrws.asp or any .htr stuff). I do trade
0-days, <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">e-mail</a> me if you want
to trade.</font><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#FFFFFF">China and Taiwan</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">Taiwan Government, why don't you just
give your country back to China ? Taiwan was from China. I understand that
Taiwan has independantly achieved a good and stable economy. But look at
Hong Kong and Macau, everything is going pretty good, so why are you declining
China ? If you keep acting like this, then China probably will attack your
country and more people will be victims while they are totally innocent!
You can't protect Taiwan against a big country like China (And no, Clinton
and the UN can't and will NOT help you, Clinton is probably playing with
girls and cigars and the UN doesn't have the power either to fight against
China, and probably weak Russia would help China). I'm sure you don't want
that to happen, cause you don't know how advanced the current military
technology of China is....</font><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font>
