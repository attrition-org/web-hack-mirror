<br><b>Hacked By Neon-Lenz</b>
<br>Admin, nothing was deleted except for the logs. For more info
<br>about the vulnerability and the fix, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:neonlenz@hushmail.com">neonlenz@hushmail.com</a>
<p><b>Re-defacing and The Hitler Crew</b>
<br>Both lame. As stated in my earlier hacks, do NOT re-deface because
it's
<br>lame and it wouldn't do you any good. (Well it depends, if you like
getting
<br>flamed and being called a lamer). <b>The Hitler Crew</b>, how many
nazi's did
<br>you kill with the game that i've hyperlinked 8) ? Btw&nbsp; next time
post
<br>something new about Hitler to make it look interesting and not the
stupid ol' shit.
<p>Trib, this one is for you 8). Tell me what you think of her :

<p><b>Greets to:</b>
<br>Tribunal, Herbless, Fux0r, G-Force Pakistan, nexus (the one who doesn't
re-deface),
<br>Ne[r0, electr0n, dislexik, pr|est, F0kus, Zyvr, Attrition, Alldas and
to everyone
<br>else who hates <b>the hitler crew/re-defacers</b>.
<p>Signing off for now..
