I'd like to thank the administrators of this website for making this all
possible. Keep up the good work admin. I patched the hole that I used to come
in, it doesn't mean there's not another one... :^) Just to keep you
guessing.<br><br>

<br><br>Hello, I'm Scurvy. I've been defacing for a little over a month
now. I don't think I'm going to deface after this one anymore. It has
gotten lame. If you don't deface anything big, like fbi.gov or mtv.com,
then it's not worth defacing if you ask me. I know you're asking, then why
did you do all the defacements you did, including this one? Well, my past
defacements, I guess were merely just testing and playing. Seeing if I
could get root on some systems and fuck up their webpages. Well, I'm
starting to think it's bullshit. I first wanted to do it, so Scurvy would
be well known among the hacker world. Well, I'm not hacker. And I am well
known, I even have my own little hate group 'Anti-Skurvy Krew' or
something. They're pretty funny, but shouldn't deface because they don't
like me. That's more childish than the reasons I defaced. I'm not going to
throw shit back and forth, that's ridiculous, and it's bullshit. Who ever
has enough time to waste by defacing sites to anger another defacer, must
be a loser with way too much time on their hands. Mad props Anti-Skurvy
Krew. Well, I'm out.
