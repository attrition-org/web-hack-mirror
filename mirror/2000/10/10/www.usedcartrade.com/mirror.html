rrrright, ok here's how things are. right now all over the world. in every nook & cranny of the internet, virtual armies of auto-evilhaxorizer scripts are scanning the hell out of literally anything with an ip number... why you may ask?  reasons vary, identity theft, simple credit card fraud, corporate espionage, etc.. and so fourth. either way people need to quit worrying who found these things and exploited them, but stopping them from happening again in the production phase. it's not necessarily an admins fault if their site gets tagged such as this. unless standards of promise are brought the unknowing are left helpless. and if you didn't know, this sorts of shit happens every day. so a vote of yay0r in your favor has been made in this nifty way...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
