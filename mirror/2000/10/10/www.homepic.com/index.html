<!-- 
• Try the official fux0r shot! 
requirements:
a.] Irish Creme Whiskey (none of the real cheap shit either...
b.] A lil bit of milk
c.] A Fresh Lemon
-
directions: 
1.] Mix drink 5/6 Irish Creme, 1/6 milk
2.] Find unknowing friend and make him take the shot, holding it in his mouth.
3.] With the shot waiting in the shooters mouth immediately make them bite and 
suck on a big piece of fresh lemon. and hold it for a sec..
-
synopsis: the lemon will force the creme shot to curdle in the shooters mouth, filling it with a bunch of weird goopy shit.
sometimes resulting in hilarious & instaneous volatile vomitting... hence, fux0r shot..

yes your correct, it's happened to you.. you've been exposed to the reality that the current
'<i>standards</i>' are not making do.  blame it on the conglomor4ts for why i got through. but
this only proves the need for attention has undoubtedly grew. now you could get angry, &
hold your breath until you are blue. or you can go get a lap dance, maybe a nice stiff shot,
shit, make it a few.. either way i didnt hurt anything, and this i vouch true. but thanks
for all the fresh warez, heh, had to grab me the new.. hell prolly half yer space is taken, an i
bet you never even knew. but oh well, heh, what can ya do? anyway i'm not here to spits any
evil haxor bits. because i'm more about informing, and when it come's to something that involves
<b>you</b>, you should take what you can get. Anyway in case you didn't know, while you sit there
unaware. theirs a bazilliongajillion signals passing by land and by air. what is the signifigance
of this you may ask? well you see thatnks to our friend the conglomor4t, these are the things that allow people all over the opportunity to violate your ass. no not on your block, or in your neighborhood, though you never know, but from all sorts of remote places, all over the globe. 
and the amount of little kiddies with ambitions of becoming little evil haxors has undebatedly rose. some may be friendly, but too many are foe's. and no one wants to spend all their time on their toe's. so improvements & standards are what are in need. through means of information & education on this
thing we call '<i>information <b>security</b>'</i>. too much publicity, time, patience, money, resources are waisted in haste. trying to punish those whom make themselves known in the race. so
people spend all their time worrying about those whom point out these flaws, would you rather they just didnt tell anyone? no one at all? why don't you start looking at the idea of stopping it before it
happens? i'm talkin about saving all this trouble beiginning from the production phaze. learning from mistakes that have already been made, i think the results will not cease to amaze. keeping these things from being able to happen in the first place is the ultimate goal. so i dont see why people get
all insulted or something when they've been shown a whole. hell if my site was to be tagged, i'd
smile and laugh, take another bong hit then spit shit on a conglomor4t and know how i just fell victim to their project time/quota/budget/marketing mouse-tr4p. you think the old lady down the street wants to learn how to use pgp? or ever wonder if the clerk at the store worries about their information security? i doubt it, because it's usually unbenounced to them, hell if ya think about while your reading this there could be someone on your very machine... oh you have the re-assurance of your logs eh? well that is poor taste, in case you dont know theirs ways around that too, sometimes as simple as
cut, copy & paiste. or maybe you <u>think</u> you know what's goin on, on your space, well i hope that you enjoy a good goose-chase. because theirs people with genuine maliscious intent all over this place.
and i do not speak of those who deface. so don't misinterpret and take it in haste. when a fux0r tag
finds its way on your page, your index is all to replace. and know that a vote of yay0r in your favor
is in due being made. in this mass rfc, for attention brought to the standards, of this day and age...

admin: nothing harmed in anyway, just bringing your attention to a flaw which
allowed me to deface your website, might as well have been me, because i dont
hurt anything. no grudges held, don't lose your buzz, all is well. if ya think
about it i'm sure you'll see this probably could have been prevented, but who 
knows...
anyway have a nice day, and remember fux0r luvs yew...
