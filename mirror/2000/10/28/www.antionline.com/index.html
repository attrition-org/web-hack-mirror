    <TD><FONT face=arial>I could have sworn this site was deemed unhackable. 
      <P>Johnny, is there any chance of getting the site's appearance changed? 
      Honestly man, it looks like some fucking playdoh workbench with Sesame 
      Street tinker toys. 
      <P>Included below are some links where you can read about the different 
      classes of programming flaws commonly found in dynamic scripts. Some of 
      these flaws led to the compromise of John Vranesevich and his slumber 
      party think tank.

        List</A> </LI></UL>The lesson inherent in this defacement is that even 
      sites with only a webserver accessible can be penetrated. Determined 
      intruders will scour your website looking for information leaks, dimwitted 
      misconfigurations, and insecurities in server-side programs. 
      <P>This hack did not require any great degree of skill. I am convinced 
      that the vulnerability I discovered would be recognized as such by anyone 
      who cared to endure the torment of wading through this retarded shithole. 
      Unsafe scripting practices and the dangers of unsanitized input have been 
      discussed for years, so why is it that AntiOnline, a site which apparently 
      extols computer security, could be owned so easily? <!-- words betray me -->
      <P>My guess here is that Bub will lose his job, then he'll scrounge 
      welfare checks or wind up as another talk show host, seeing that he looks 
      like the by-product of Phil Donahue and Barney the Dinosaur anyway. JP is 
      gonna shit his pants when he sees this, but that's ok cuz he can clean it 
      up with the pages of his Sally Struthers mail-order security manual. 
      Meanwhile, YOU can send in your comments about this to AntiOnline's Weekly 
      Windbag.
