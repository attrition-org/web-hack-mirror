Wow, this site belongs to a highly skilled professional security admin... <br>
who still got hacked by the script kiddies he hates so much..<br>
this shit about getting isp accounts closed... quoted from the original site:<br>
"Please keep in mind that every move you make on this web site is fully logged<br>
and reviewed daily. Many a script-kiddie has had their ISP account terminated<br>
due to me."
<br>
Well, i dont like such cocky attitudes....<br>
seems to me your just a stuck up piece of shit with no real clue how to do your job..<br>
ohh.. and your a sad fucker if you read logs every day<br>
well.. you can have a day off, coz ur logs have been deleted.<br>
And, I didn`t backup your index page. I deleted that too<br>
