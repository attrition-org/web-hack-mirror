INITIATIVE<br>
<br>
SALMON AND STEELHEAD HABITAT<br>
INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT PROJECT</font><font size="3"><br>
</font></h3>

<h4><font size="2">ISSUE:</font></h4>

<p><font size="2"><b>I</b>mplementation of SSHIAP is a necessary
component for the overall <i>Wild Salmon Restoration Initiative</i>.
Identification and evaluation of the status of salmon and
steelhead stocks (SASSI) in itself is inadequate without
assessing the quality and quantity of their habitat. The purposes
and benefits of the SSHIAP are several fold. The habitat
inventory and assessment project will provide: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">the necessary counter part to evaluation
        of stock status. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">an assessment of the degradation of the
        quality and quantity of salmon and steelhead habitat; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">necessary information to support state,
        federal, and tribal efforts to conduct watershed analysis
        as part of state regulation of forest practices and
        implementation of the President's Forest Plan. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">information necessary to evaluate impaired
        water bodies as required under the Clean Water Act; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">basin specific protection and restoration
        strategies; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">a means to prioritize restoration projects
        that are most cost effective at restoring basin
        production; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">a mechanism to coordinate state, federal,
        tribal, local, and private restoration activities; and </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">the necessary information to integrate
        habitat strategies with those of harvest and enhancement
        management programs to allow for overall basin plans to
        recover salmon and steelhead resources and fisheries. </font></li>
</ul>

<h4><font size="2">BACKGROUND:</font></h4>

<p><font size="2">During the past several years Indian Tribes and
WDFW have cooperatively developed a joint assessment of the
status of salmon and steelhead stocks in Washington State in
response to concerns about declining populations. To address
these issues the state and Tribal governments have joined in a
Wild Stock Restoration Initiative (WSRI). As part of the WSRI,
the state and tribal governments in 1995, conducted the first
version of the Washington State Salmon and Steelhead Stock
Inventory (SASSI). The SASSI process identified distinct spawning
populations (stocks) and described their status based on
information currently available. More detailed material on
individual stocks has been compiled in regional SASSI appendices.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In the meantime, federal involvement in the
issue of stock status has accelerated as a result of the
submission of numerous petitions to list salmon and steelhead
stocks under the Endangered Species Act and subsequent stock
status review by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to
determine the merit of these petitions. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In order for the State and Tribes to take
constructive action to reverse stock decline and achieve
recovery, it is critical that the role of habitat loss and
impairment in the decline of individual salmon and steelhead
populations be well understood and documented. The SASSI
Appendices did not assemble or draw conclusions on habitat data
or related issues. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The counter part to SASSI is to conduct a joint
tribal/state cooperative action to document current habitat
conditions, assess the role of habitat degradation and loss in
the status of salmon and steelhead stocks, develop stock or
watershed/basin specific strategies for habitat protection and
restoration, and prepare a cooperative strategy to obtain funding
to implement the habitat restoration/protection strategies. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Defining habitat protection and restoration
strategies are only part the solution to a comprehensive recovery
of the salmon and steelhead stocks. To achieve stock recovery
goals, habitat protection and restoration must be part of an
integrated stock strategy that also addresses hatchery production
and harvest management.. </font></p>

<h4><font size="2">PURPOSE</font></h4>

<p><font size="2">The purpose of this project is to develop a
blueprint for joint tribal/state cooperative action to document
current habitat conditions, assess the role of habitat
degradation and loss in the status of salmon and steelhead
stocks, develop stock- or watershed/basin specific strategies for
habitat protection and restoration, and prepare a cooperative
strategy to obtain funding to implement the habitat
restoration/protection strategies. </font></p>

<h4><font size="2">TIMELINE</font></h4>

<p><font size="2">The project began in August 1995 and will
continue through at least August 1997. </font></p>

<h4><font size="2">PRODUCTS</font></h4>

<p><font size="2">Products will include: </font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2">Expanded habitat sections for the SASSI
        Appendices that describe the location, amount and current
        condition of habitats utilized at various life history
        stages, historic habitat loss, and the natural and human
        factors contributing to habitat loss and impairment; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Maps showing habitats used by each stock; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">A habitat protection and restoration
        strategy for each stock or watershed; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">A list that identifies future study needs
        to fill data gaps and improve the analysis; </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">A funding strategy to obtain resources
        necessary to implement habitat protection/restoration
        strategies and collect necessary research. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2"><b>WATERSHED REPORT OUTLINE</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">To facilitate use of habitat inventory
information on a statewide, regional or evolutionary significant
(ESU) scale, it is important that information be collected and
compiled in a consistent manner. This outline is intended to
provide a consistent format for information from each watershed,
recognizing that the type, amount and quality of information will
vary between watersheds. The following sections of a salmon and
steelhead habitat inventory and assessment report are listed in
order of priority of completion. It will be important to focus on
the first four sections of the report to adequately address the
remainder of the sections. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 1: Basin Description</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">This should be a brief section that describes
the physical setting of the basin, the stream network, climate,
geology, vegetation and the general land-use patterns. Give an
overview of the basin that documents its unique characteristics .
Sources of information include WARIS, the stream catalog, and
watershed management plans. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 2: Description of Stocks Present in
Basin</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">This section should describe the salmon and
steelhead stocks present in the basin. Describe the life history
stages and general habitat requirements for each stock. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 3: Current and Historic Habitat
Utilization</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">This section should describe, and identify on
maps, the habitats used during the fresh-water and estuarine life
history stages of each stock (both current and historic). Sources
of information include WARIS, the WDFW stream catalog, and basin
specific information on habitat loss. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 4: Physical Habitat Description</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">This section should describe current habitat
conditions and the extent and causes of habitat loss and
impairment for stream reaches throughout the basin. For each
stream reach, describe: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">Current habitat conditions </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Nature and extent of historical habitat
        loss or impairment </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Factors causing habitat loss or impairment
        (adverse impacts) </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2">Examples of habitat conditions to consider in
the analysis include: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Migration barriers restricting access to
historically available habitat such as culverts and road
crossings, dams, temperature and pollution barriers, dry stream
reaches and other miscellaneous barriers. Also consider adult
holding habitat such as spring chinook and summer steelhead. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Spawning and incubation habitat conditions such
as loss of spawning gravel, gravel degradation from fine
sediments, gravel scour associated with peak flows, pollution,
and other destruction, blockage or degradation of spawning
habitat. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Summer and over-winter juvenile habitat
conditions such as pool habitat (quantity, depth and volume and
cover),stream temperature/shading, LWD, low flows, water quality
degradation, destruction or blockage of side channel, slough and
off-channel habitats, and the destruction, blockage or
degradation of juvenile habitats. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Out-migration and estuarine habitat conditions
such as availability of channel margin habitats, stranding,
destruction of estuarine habitat, shoreline habitat alterations,
water quality and other factors causing destruction, blockage or
degradation of out-migration and estuarine habitats. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Identify natural constraints and human impacts
that are now or have in the past contributed to habitat
impairment or loss. Contributing factors should include both
those that directly impact habitat and those that alter watershed
processes contributing to disturbance or alteration of downstream
habitat. In addition, identify any non-impaired habitats that are
sensitive to future impairment due to changes in land-use or
other factors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sources of information include WARIS for stream
blockages, WDFW stream catalog, TFW Ambient Monitoring habitat
surveys, Watershed Analysis reports; state, federal, tribal, or
local water quality reports, watershed management plans and
miscellaneous habitat surveys. To the maximum extent possible,
quantify historic loss recognizing appropriate assumptions and
caveats. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 5: Effects of Habitat Loss and
Impairment on Stocks Present in the Basin</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">Discuss how habitat loss and impairment
(discussed in Section 4) is affecting overall production of each
stock present in the basin. Identify significant factors limiting
production at each life history stage. Significant limiting
factors will probably vary among stocks due to differences in the
life history stages present, and differences in the locations of
important production areas. Using the best information available,
use quantitative methods (such as those developed by the Skagit
System or the PNPTC Coho model) to estimate production lost due
to habitat destruction and impairment for each species. Compare
limiting factors to identify the most significant overall
production bottlenecks for each species. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 6: Habitat Protection and Restoration
Strategy</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">Use the information assembled in the previous
steps to develop habitat protection and restoration strategy for
each basin that addresses the needs of each stock present. The
habitat protection/restoration strategy should identify: </font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2">Habitat goals and performance standards
        (targets for habitat conditions). </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Measures (and information) needed to
        protect habitat (including action needed by state.
        tribal, federal, local and private entities). </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Measures (and information) necessary to
        restore habitat (these may need to be rather general
        given the time and information constraints). </font></li>
</ol>

<h5><font size="1">Section 7: Research and monitoring information
gaps</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">This section should identify information gaps,
i.e. areas where further research or monitoring would improve the
habitat inventory, or the habitat protection and restoration
plan. </font></p>

<h5><font size="1">Section 8: Funding proposal</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">This section is an opportunity for parties in
the watershed to identify and coordinate funding needs for
implementation of the habitat protection and restoration plan or
to address information gaps identified in section 7. </font></p>
