When human rights are trashed... n/p it's always an accident... if accidentaly a civilian dies during a millitary training... it's ok... it's only a fucking accident... but when military shit gets defaced everyone is pissed... "geez, these evil crackers/hackers/cyber-terrorists are tampering with our national security"... Fuck OFF...  <br><br>

PentaGuard is back, taking .gov/.mil defacements into another millenium...<br>
Yes, we're still the old "only .gov/mil defacers", why ? Well... first of all PG has a tradition in defacing .gov and .mil domains... if we would sudenly change our targets it would be like Mercedes would be making laptops and IBM sport cars... Second: I think that hitting the government is always a good thing... why hit small little private webistes when U can hit the government... 


<br><br>
Uhm... many ppl ask me... "why do you hack ?", "is defacing fun ?", bla bla bla...<br>
<br>Every hacker, script-kiddie or what'ever has it's own reasons for defacing... We have our own specific reasons for defacing <br>
Here's a little poem... maybe you'll understand better why do we hack <br>
<br><u>Why do we hack</u><br><br>

Why do we hack ?<br>
We hack for beer, whisky, vodka and wine<br>
We hack for alcohol and everything that would make us high<br>
We hack for having fun, and mostly... <br>
For gettin' drunk<br><br>
We hack for freedom of speach and free-mp3's<br>
We hack for free phone calls and pirated CD's<br>
We hack for free-sex and cheaper blowjobs<br>
We hack cause we don't like our jobs<br>
<br>
We hack for free-software and no-more-microshit<br>
We hack for less Ricky Martin and N'Sync-bullshit<br>
We hack for Eminem, Limp Bizkit and everyone who's kewl<br>
We hack cause Windows 98 still crash at /null/null<br>
<br>
We don't hack for money and fame or shit like that<br>
We hack because we're bored and that's fuckin sad<br>
