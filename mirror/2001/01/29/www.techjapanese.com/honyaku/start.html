This translation tool employs a Japanese morpheme analysis system called "ChaSen" that is distributed free of charge by the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.  To read more about Chasen, please visit their home page by clicking <a href="http://cl.aist-nara.ac.jp/lab/nlt/chasen/" target="_new">here</a>.   English translations are looked up in publicly available <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/j_edict.html" target="_new">EDICT</a> dictionaries.<p>  
This system is still under development so results will vary. <br>
