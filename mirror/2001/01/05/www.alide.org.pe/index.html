<p>I just want to say <span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFF00" size="5">MEAT=DINNER</font></span><font size="5">
</font>I like a good steak and I am so glad when they kill a big ass juicy cow
to feed me.&nbsp; Also I would also like to say fuck Palestine and Israel I
think that we need to nuke both of you asses.&nbsp; And as far as the Pakistan
and India hackers go you both stink (and I really mean that, you smell really
bad, take a bath or something) ( p.s. I also ate your god for dinner tonight) I
saw a some really cool site the other day that spoke the truth.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.whiteamericans.com">www.whiteamericans.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.stormfront.org">www.stormfront.org </a>.&nbsp; both are
very secure though, I checked them out before this hack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>EAT MEAT TO LIVE</p>
<p>Fuck Peace, it's overrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploit the lamer nations and watch them die.</p>
