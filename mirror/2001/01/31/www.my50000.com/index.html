      <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I would like to talk about a
little 
      manner that I saw on the local news today. A 13 year old form a
eastern 
      state was put into a hospital for copying a stunt from a television
show 
      called <i><font color="#000000">JACK ASS</font></i>. The teen copied
the 
      human BQ. Well there is an out roar on the teavtion show. We for the
governor 
      that is contacting MTV about this show well I do hope that you have
enough 
      to back up your thoughts. Here is my reason why that there is not
much you 
      and the the family with the burned teen. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I do watch this show my self, what I see is a generation of the punk
rockers/Skaters 
      Out to do stupid things. Some of the things that they do are border
line. 
      Like swimming in human waste or playing in cow pies. Other than that
I do 
      see high safely on the show. They do a check up before the do a
stunt like 
      po po diving the went and got the shots, for the Bees on the guys
Penis 
      he went to see if he was allergic to the bee stings. So my words to
you 
      governor Is that you need to watch the show before having a big
complaint 
      about it.<br>
