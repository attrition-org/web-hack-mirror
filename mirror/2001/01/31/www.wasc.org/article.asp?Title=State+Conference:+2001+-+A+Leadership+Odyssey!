                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><b>Pulaski High School Student Council</b> has been hard at work planning exciting and educational activities for your conference.  This year’s conference will be held in Green Lake on May 6th and 7th, 2001:  mark your calendars!  It will be an experience of a lifetime that you won’t want to miss.  The two keynote speakers for this year’s conference have been selected, and their combination of personal experience, wit, and leadership wisdom promises two very inspiring days.<br>
<br>
<b>Ed Gerety</b> is a captivating inspirational speaker that helps students take action, believe in themselves, and respect one another.  His high-energy story telling and humorous personal experiences keep audiences involved, making them appreciate life and reach out to make a difference in their school, community, and world.
<b>  Ed</b> is a contributing author featured in Teen Power Too, an inspirational and humorous book for teens.  He encourages students to take positive risks and will leave a lasting impact on the delegates of this year’s conference.<br>
<br>
<b>Earl Reum </b> will be making his return to the Wisconsin State Conference.  After serving as the Colorado State Executive Director for Student Councils and the Co-Director of the National Leadership Camp Cheley with
<b> Don Larsen</b>, <b> Earl </b> has a special connection to Student Council and the WASC.  With his extensive first-hand experience in dealing with today’s student leaders, he offers direct advice and inspiration.  But with Earl, there’s no telling what form this inspiration will come in.  He has tricks up every sleeve, which are sure to keep each delegate entranced while teaching lessons to last a lifetime.<br>
<br>
Please take note of this year’s <b> Service Project</b>.  Pulaski High School Student Council has organized the donation of Toiletry Items to area pantries.  Any items such as toothpaste, shampoo, feminine products, deodorant, etc., will be collected at Green Lake this year when schools come to registration.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Pulaski is also looking for quality sectionals to be presented.  Topics such as expanding leadership, improving your councils, or leading by example are just some ideas for sectionals.  If your school has an activity that you would like to share, don’t hesitate to apply for presenting.  A
<b> Sectional Presenter Application </b> has been sent to every school and is included in
this month's issue of News Notes, so start thinking about your sectional now.  The sooner applications are turned in, the better.<br>
