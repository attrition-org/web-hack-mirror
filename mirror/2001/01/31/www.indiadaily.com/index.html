JERUSALEM: Masked gunmen dashed into Gaza City's seaside Beach Hotel in broad daylight Wednesday and executed the chief of the Palestinian television network, a well-connected but unpopular official close to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. 
Israel immediately denied any link to the gangland-style hit. 
Whoever the assassins turn out to be, the killing of someone so close to Arafat sent a chilling message throughout Palestinian society and reinforced a profound sense of insecurity and fear. 
Palestinian police said Hisham Miki, executive director of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corp., fell dead in the hotel's restaurant after two gunmen pumped repeated rounds into his chest and head before escaping in a waiting car. 
The slaying came amid a spate of Israeli assassinations of Palestinian militants and Palestinian killings of accused collaborators, all part of the brutal conflict that has roiled this region for the last 3 1/2 months and destroyed once-promising prospects for a definitive peace. 
While some Palestinian officials publicly suggested an Israeli role in Miki's death, Palestinian security officers were instead focusing their investigation on corruption allegations involving Miki's lucrative business dealings. He may have been the victim of a political or personal vendetta, several Palestinian sources said.

The violence came as Indian security forces tightened security
and intensified searches in the region ahead of India's January 26 Republic Day
celebrations when militants have threatened to strike. Officials said an
unidentified militant was killed on Thursday in a gun battle with Indian police
in the Bemina area of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir.</b></font></p>

has to say on the violence</u>:-</font></p>
WASHINGTON, Jan 25: Welcoming the second
Indian extension of the Kashmir ceasefire, the United States on Wednesday said
it believed the peace process would be greatly enhanced if the Kashmiri freedom
fighters groups responded positively to India's announcement by taking steps to
halt violence.<br>
<br>
Replying to questions at his daily press briefing, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher also said the government of Pakistan should use its influence
with Kashmiri groups to urge them to end violence in the territory.<br>
<br>
Asked whether the ceasefire extensions were leading anywhere, Mr. Boucher said:
&quot;Certainly, we think it is a good thing. This followed on earlier steps,
positive steps, that we have seen from both India and Pakistan. We believe the
peace process would be greatly enhanced if the Kashmiri groups responded
positively to India's announcement by taking steps to halt the violence. We
would encourage all the parties to take initiatives to reduce violence and
foster a process to end the conflict in Kashmir.
