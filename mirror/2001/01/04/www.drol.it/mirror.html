<P align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=+1>Fundamentalism (of any 
kind) troubles me. The world is too big and too intricate to conform to our 
ideas of what it should be like. In my experience I've found that most 
fundamentalists aren't so much attached to their professed ideologies as they 
are to the way in which these ideologies try to make sense of a confusing world. 
But the world is confusing, and just because we invent myths and theories to 
explain away the chaos we're still going to live in a world that's older and 
more complicated than we'll ever understand. So many religious and political and 
scientific and social systems fail in that they try to impose a rigid structure 
onto what is an inherently ambiguous world. I'm not suggesting that we stop 
trying to understand things. Trying to understand the world can be fun and, at 
times, helpful. But if we base our belief systems on the humble assumption that 
the complexities of the world are ontologically beyond our understanding, then 
maybe our belief systems will make more sense and end up causing less 
suffering.<BR></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=+2></FONT></P>
