<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1">Just a message to the israeli and palestinian guys. I understand you are fighting
for a solution, but violence doesn't give a solution, it only makes it more diffult
to find one. I'm not saying who to blame...where to are fighting, both sides are
to blame..but i disapprove the israeli violence against children, but also the
bomb attacks on israeli targets.</FONT></P>
