<p align="center">although i am not religous , not buddhist, not christian, not blind<br>
i was never hindu, never muslim, never baptist, always kind<br>
not left, not right, not skinny , not fat<br>
i always thought things were the way they were<br>
and that was that<br>
when i grew up on the streets i found that things were still the same<br>
what i had learned was real, i had no shame<br>
as time ticked by, and the wrong of the world ran by<br>
i always sat on the corner, propped on a rock<br>
i watched that clock<br>
and i watched time<br>
education is the essential ingredient of a higher life<br>
no matter what you study, or what you think is right<br>
just remember that were all one in the same</p>

<p align="center">trinity</p>

<p align="center">the top point represents TRUTH<br>
the bi polar points represent the dual opposing sides<br>
anyone who studies human logic depth and enlightenment would have<br>
studied trinities<br>
and would understand the point of 3, netrual by duality<br>
the secret to breaking racism<br>
to breaking the fight<br>
to breaking whats wrong<br>
and realizing whats right<br>
is realizing that without opposing dual sides<br>
the trinity does not exist<br>
only a single truth would exist, and that is considered<br>
the gods eye<br>
life is more complicated then realizing the gods eye of view in <br>
a simple step<br>
we do it in ourselfs<br>
and then we try to do it together, however, some of our perceptions<br>
differ<br>
the friction of opposing sides is what creates truth</p>

<p align="center">&quot;as soon as a man is fully disposed to be alone with God, he is
alone with god no <br>
matter where he be.. in the country , the monastery, the woods or the city.<br>
The lightening flashes from East to West, illuminating the whole horizon and <br>
striking where it pleases and at the same instant the infinite liberty of god <br>
flashes in the depths of that mans soul, an dhe is illumined. At that moment<br>
he sees that though he seems to be in the middle of his journey, he has already<br>
arrived at the end. For the life of grace on earth is the beginning of the life<br>
of Glory. Although he is a traveler in time, he has opened his eyes for a moment<br>
in eternity&quot; -Merton</p>

<p align="center">let me remind you that i do not follow a religon, i only follow</p>

<p align="center">higher truth and understanding</p>

<p align="center">dual opposing sides will always have a third point</p>

<p align="center">let me compare text for those who doubt</p>

<p align="center">my research and education</p>

<p align="center"><u>we have the east</u></p>

<p align="center">&quot; we are born into the world of nature; our second birth is into
the world of spirit&quot; -bhagavad gita</p>

<p align="center">yes b1t reads.. b1t reads much</p>

<p align="center"><u>we have the west</u></p>

<p align="center">&quot; except ye be converted and become as little childern, ye shall
not enter the kingdom of heaven&quot; - jesus</p>

<p align="center">but the essential point of this trinity</p>

<p align="center">is that&nbsp; we all shed our primary life, in the hopes of reaching</p>

<p align="center">the spiritual self.</p>
