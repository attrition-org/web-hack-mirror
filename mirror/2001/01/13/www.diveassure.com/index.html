        <p align="center"><font face="Impact" color="#000000" size="4">Big
        difference here.&nbsp; And remember, it was Israel that began the
        current crisis by having 1000 Israeli troops storm the streets of
        Jerusalem, shooting at everything and everyone in their way, on Sept.
        29.&nbsp; Now Israel has totally closed the West Bank and Gaza,
        preventing food, medical supplies, and other humanitarian needs&nbsp; to
        reach the victims of Israel's inhumanity, and making life even more of a
        nightmare for the Palestinian people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Impact" size="4" color="#000000">Having
        Israeli soldiers shoot at Palestinian ambulances, fire missiles at kids,
        and enforce economic hardship on the Palestinians is not a good way of
        promoting peace m0sad.&nbsp; That only makes the Palestinian people more
        determined to get their freedom from you Israeli oppressors.&nbsp; The
        bombings happen because the people Israeli oppresses want change.&nbsp;
        They're sick of seeing their children being shot dead in cold blood by
        the sub-human Israeli soldiers. They're tired of being insulted and
        abused by the IDF in front of their children's eyes.&nbsp; They're fed
        up with Israeli soldiers routinely firing at their homes, farms,
        ambulances, etc.&nbsp; All the Palestinians want is their basic human
        rights...the right to live in the native land of Palestine they were
        born on, the right to be happy, to live life...the very rights Israeli
        scum deny them.</font></p>

        these negotiations are severely biased and slanted towards Israel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The so-called “bridging proposal” Bill Clinton of America is
        proposing says that the Palestinian people must renounce the right of 5
        million Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        This means that the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families which
        were thrown out of their homes will have no right to return to their
        native land.&nbsp; </span>Is this by any means fair?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><b>These people were single-handedly thrown out of their own
        homes, their families were torn apart, and their new generations grew up
        in largely-populated refugee camps, determined to win back their native
        homeland that had been unjustly stripped of them.</b><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is even more amazing is that even though Clinton’s
        “bridging proposal” is greatly biased towards Israel, the majority
        of the Israeli public is still criticizing it and complaining that
        Jerusalem for some odd, inscrutable reason should for all time remain
        Israel’s “eternal” capital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        army to torment, dehumanize, and murder Palestinian children and women.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;

        Heights, and the Sheba Farms.<span style="mso-spacerun:
