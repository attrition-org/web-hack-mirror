<CENTER><H4>I still can't believe you got 0WN3D by warlord1101 and Coaxial
Terror. I should be thanking grimR from r00t-access for the root on your
piece of shit Redhat 6.2 box. Apache needed to be reinstalled, thanks to
the admin's stupidity, but it's all good, now you look like a moron. 
<P>www.eeb.net eh? Guess what ladies and gentlemen! www.eeb.net <B>HAS BEEN
HACKED.</B>

<P><B>Shoutz go out to: grimR, Abiotic_, drumcode, gideon[zs], Carsten, Mr.
Kubica (You both know who you are), krewl666, mc2880, icefist, B0OB, lokal,
bios, initd_, Skye, sniper-, EvilCrusader, and all the others that I've
missed.
<P><P><P><U>A few words to the admin:</U> Listen up, and listen VERY
closely: REDHAT IS BULLSHIT, same with Mandrake and all those other
pieces of shit, if you want security, you want a BSD distro, BECAUSE
THEY OWN YOUR ASS.I hope you have at least
learned your lesson from using piece of shit EXTREMELY OLD Redhat products.
<P>Now, if you'd like to convert to BSD, I would be happy to help you,
cause
I'm tired of seeing more and more companies and educational sites go down like this.
