Dear Attrition.Org:

Our site (www.valiantspirit.com) was hit by a hacker calling 
him/herself "Tokachu". I have included the mirror of the hack, with 
images, in an attached ZIP file. These sites were also defaced with the 
same content:

www.kunfusion.net
www.vandalized.net

(NOTE:The content appears to be from CNET, but it is not. It is just 
copied HTML and images. Why ads are left intact I do not know.)

All of these machines, including mine, are running RedHat Linux 6.2 
with the Apache server.

Hopefully, you can respond and inform us on any measures to take for 
increased security. Thank you.
