Carolyn Meinel vs. GFH. Round 1:

*blargh*

Hi Carolyn.  Nice to see that you're taking security seriously, after all,
all of us 3r33t h4x0r5 tremble in ph34r at your oh-so-elite 'Guides to 
Mostly Harmless Hacking'.. maybe you should write yet another book 
detailing the intricate 'hacking secrets' of how to change your Windows
wallpaper?!

Why not, let's make some money out of the clueless scriptkids, huh?
Oh wait.. you *are* a clueless scriptkid.. damn, almost forgot...

So Carolyn, are we ever going to see anything technical come out of 
'Happyhacker'? Or are you just going to rename it to something more
appropriate.. let's see.. 'Saddementedandcraqhedhacker' and have done 
with it..

For anyone who might have thought about employing the oh-so-elite
staff of 'techbroker' (hi craqhed!) -- please take a look at the
following:

Oh, enjoy restoring your site from backups, Carolyn, not that there was
anything worth restoring..
