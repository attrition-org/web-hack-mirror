        by tradition, respect their elders. As the parable goes, 'they wash their 
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> feet and drink that 
        water'. Thousands of elderly people have either been killed or tortured 
        in a dehumanising manner. Their beards have been pulled and they have 
        been beaten up. They&nbsp; </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        have been searched in line-ups on the roads, stripped bare in front of 
        the members&nbsp; </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> of 
        community. These elderly have suffered because they would not reveal the 
        where </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> abouts of the 
        young ones. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On 13th 
        August 1999, the military moved in and occupied Sichun village in South 
        Kashmir, </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> searched the 
        whole village and made arrests after chaotic scenes were created. Gukam

        Hussian Kada, both elderly, were tortured for 3 hours in a school building

        Early that </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> morning,

        endured the brunt of the revolution. An estimated one million women have

        Gang-rapes have </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> made

        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mrs Saja Begam, 46, 
        from Shikargah, reported to the local police </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        wants to commit </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> rape 
        with my two daughters. I want protection." Two days later, Singh raided 
        the house with a </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> hooded

        Singh shot </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> her in the
