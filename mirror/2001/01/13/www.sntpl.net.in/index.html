              current agitation in Indian-Held Kashmir is rooted in the struggle 
              of the people for the exercise of the right of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-determination. 
              Peaceful processions chanting demands for freedom were fired upon 
              by Indian Army and Police. Hundreds of men, women and children have 
              been killed or wounded.&nbsp; New Delhi's allegations of assistance 
              to the Kashmiri people from the Pakistan side are unfounded. </font>
            <p>&nbsp;
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Objective reports 
              in foreign media testify that the Kashmiri agitation is indigenous.&nbsp; 
              Pakistan upholds the right of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to 
              self-determination in accordance with the resolutions of the United 
              Nations Security Council. These resolutions of 1948 and 1949 provide 
              for the holding of a free and impartial plebiscite for the determination 
              of the future of the State by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.&nbsp; 
              The basic points about the UN resolutions are that :&nbsp; (i) the 
              complaint relating to Kashmir was initiated by India in the Security 
              Council ; (ii) the Council explicitly and by implication, rejected 
              India's claim that Kashmir is legally Indian territory; (iii) the 
              resolutions established self-determination as the governing principle 
              for the settlement of the Kashmir dispute. This is the world body's 
              commitment to the people of Kashmir ; (iv) the resolutions endorsed 
              a binding agreement between India and Pakistan reached through the 
              mediation of UNCIP, that a plebiscite would be held, under agreed 
              and specified conditions.&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> The Security 
              Council has rejected the Indian contention that the people of Kashmir 
              have exercised their right of self-determination by participating 
              in the &quot;elections&quot; which India has from time to time organised 
              in the Held Kashmir. The 0.2% turn out during the 1989 &quot;elections&quot; 
              was the most recent clear repudiation of the Indian claim.&nbsp; 
              Pakistan continues to adhere to the UN resolutions. These are binding 
              also on India.&nbsp; The Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, to which 
              Pakistan also continues to adhere, did not alter the status of Jammu 
              and Kashmir as a disputed territory:&nbsp; Para 6 of the Agreement 
              lists &quot;a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir&quot; as one 
              of the outstanding questions awaiting a settlement.&nbsp; Para 4 
              (ii) talks of a &quot;Line of Control&quot; as distinguished from 
              an international border. Furthermore, it explicitly protects &quot;the 
              recognised position of either side,&quot; The recognised position 
              of Pakistan is the one which is recognised by the United Nations 
              and the World Community in general.&nbsp; Article I (iv) obviously 
              refers to the Kashmir issue when it talks of &quot;the basic issues 
              and causes of conflict which have bedevilled the relations between 
              the two countries for the last 25 years.&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> The Simla Agreement 
              does not preclude raising of Kashmir issue at the United Nations:&nbsp; 
              Para I (I) specifically provides that the UN Charter &quot;shall 
              govern&quot; relations between the parties.&nbsp; Para I (ii) providing 
              for settlement of differences by peaceful means, does not exclude 
              resort to the means of pacific settlement of disputes and differences 
              provided in the UN Charter.&nbsp; The UN Security Council remains 
              seized of the Kashmir issue which ermines onf the Council's agenda.&nbsp; 
              Articles 34 and 35 of the UN Charter specifically empower the Security 
              Council to investigate any dispute independently or at the request 
              of a member State. These provisions cannot be made subservient to 
              any bilateral agreement.&nbsp; According to Article 103 of the UN 
              Charter, member States obligations under the Charter take precedence 
              over obligations under a bilateral agreement.&nbsp; Presence of 
              United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) 
              at the Line of Control in Kashmir is a clear evidence off UN's involvement 
              in the Kashmir issue.&nbsp; Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory.

              involve the principle of respect for the unity and territorial integrity 
              of states, to which Pakistan adheres.&nbsp; Attempts to forcibley 
              suppress the legitimate demands of the people of Jammu and Kashmir 
              are doomed to failure. Similarly, threats of use of force will not 
              affect Pakistan's resolve to maintain its position of principle.&nbsp;
