<p align="left">&nbsp;Jewish settlers backed up by the Israeli occupation army and border police burned down the "Al-Hoda" Mosque in al-Mawasi, south of Gaza last night, Palestinian sources said.<br>
<br>
The settlers for the second time attacked houses of Palestinian civilians Monday night following the death of a settler in the area.<br>
<br>
Palestinians called through mosque microphones to head to Jewish settlements to alleviate the pressure on Palestinian civilians at Almawasi.<br>
<br>
One Palestinian was critically injured and the atmosphere was described as "extremely tense."<b><br>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" color="#FFFFFF">THE
DEATH TOLL IN THE PAST 3 MONTHS</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">330
Palestinians dead, 41 Israelis dead</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">17,000
Palestinians wounded, About 100 Israelis wounded</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Big
difference here.&nbsp; And remember, it was Israel that began the current crisis
by having 1000 Israeli troops storm the streets of Jerusalem, shooting at
everything and everyone in their way, on Sept. 29.&nbsp; Now Israel has totally
closed the West Bank and Gaza, preventing food, medical supplies, and other
humanitarian needs&nbsp; to reach the victims of Israel's inhumanity, and making
life even more of a nightmare for the Palestinian people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Having
Israeli soldiers shoot at Palestinian ambulances, fire missiles at kids, and
enforce economic hardship on the Palestinians is not a good way of promoting
peace m0sad.&nbsp; That only makes the Palestinian people more determined to get
their freedom from you Israeli oppressors.&nbsp; The bombings happen because the
people Israeli oppresses want change.&nbsp; They're sick of seeing their
children being shot dead in cold blood by the sub-human Israeli soldiers.
They're tired of being insulted and abused by the IDF in front of their
children's eyes.&nbsp; They're fed up with Israeli soldiers routinely firing at
their homes, farms, ambulances, etc.&nbsp; All the Palestinians want is their
basic human rights...the right to live in the native land of Palestine they were
born on, the right to be happy, to live life...the very rights Israeli scum deny
them.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;<b>A message from m0r0n and nightman of WFD:</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" color="#FFFFFF">After
all this it is very strange how the U.S.A. is still preparing itself to sworn in
the new President and how the &quot;old&quot; President is having meeting after
meeting and as expected coming to a dead end. It is really puzzling how come the
other countries of the world are still sitting idle watching the U.N. favoring
Israel as they favor India&nbsp; in the Kashmir crisis</font><font size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" color="#FFFFFF">.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" color="#FFFFFF">After
all this AT LEAST <i>we </i>can never sit idle. So here we are hacking and
defacing for the truth and making sure that people all around the world are
globally aware of facts, which are not only true but tear jerking and heart
breaking too.</font></p>
