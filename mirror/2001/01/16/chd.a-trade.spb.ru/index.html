<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Courier">Another site
owned, another six pack of tasty Jolt Cola wasted while sitting<br>
in front of the glowing command line. Aaahhh... root.<br>
Such a sweet, yet forbidden fruit. Well, we got it from you,
good.<br>
Well, this site *has* been hacked. No, it wasn't very hard at
all.<br>
We aren't doing this to be l33t0 h4x0rz or anything like that, we
just want<br>
to get the message across. No computer is secure. <b>Anyone</b>
can be hacked. <br>
No matter how big your business or how technologically advanced
your network, <br>
sooner or later, you'll be hacked. This is what happened here.<br>
Security is only as strong as it's weakest link, that's the
hacker's job - <br>
to find that link and exploit it to gain further access.<br>
Normally you would have something to be afraid of, but not today.
We come not to hurt your data, <br>
but to explore. We have found your site insecure and have brought
that fact to your attention. <br>
In the future, you should think more about these things and maybe
this won't happen again. <br>
We are just informing you of this weak security before someone <br>
with a malicious intent gets there first. <br>
... Now that this has been said, on to the other stuff ...</font></p>
