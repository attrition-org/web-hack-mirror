This is our world now...the world of the electron and the switch,<br> the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing<br> without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by<br> profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore...and<br> you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge...and you call us<br> criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, <br>cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own <br>good, yet we're the criminals.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is<br> that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they<br> look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that<br> you will never forgive me for. You may stop this individual, but<br>you can't stop us all...after all, we're all alike.
