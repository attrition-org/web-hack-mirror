        newspapers of America are full everyday with flagrant lies about the
        events happening in the Middle East.&nbsp; In fact, the entire American
        media distorts the truth and twists it as to manipulate the minds of the
        American people.&nbsp; Suffering Palestinian
        children are portrayed as &quot;terrorists&quot;, simply because they
        fight for their freedom from an oppressor that seeks to destroy their
        hopes and dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">1947,
All of what is now modern Israel was Palestine.&nbsp; Out of seemingly nowhere,
ultra-nationalistic Jews came out of nowhere, butchered and killed thousands
upon thousands of Muslim and Christian Palestinians in order to steal the
authority.&nbsp; Babies were beheaded.&nbsp; Children's throats were slit.&nbsp;
500 Palestinian villages were wiped off the map.&nbsp; Hundreds of Mosques and
Churches were eradicated.&nbsp; Over 5 Million Palestinians were thrown out of
their homes and forced to live in refugee camps in Gaza, West Bank, and
neighboring countries.&nbsp; And for 50+ years, the Palestinian people have been
indiscriminately treated as 2nd Class Citizens, denied not only the land that is
rightfully theirs, but also the basic human rights of common society.&nbsp;
This...is the great injustice of the Middle East...</font>PALESTINIAN CHILDREN
LIVE IN SEVERE AND UNIMAGINABLE POVERTY.&nbsp; THEY DON'T HAVE THE TOYS, GAMES,
AND AMENITIES THAT OTHER CHILDREN LOVE AND ENJOY.&nbsp; INSTEAD, THEY SEE
ISRAELI SOLDIERS BOMBARD THEIR HOMES, SLAUGHTER THEIR PEERS,&nbsp; RAPE THEIR
MOTHERS,&nbsp; AND ABUSE THEIR FAMILY DAILY.&nbsp; IT IS VERY NATURAL FOR
SOMEONE WHO GOES THROUGH THIS TO DEMAND A BETTER LIFE.&nbsp; </font></b><b><font size="2" face="Arial">But
instead, the vast majority of American newspapers blame the Palestinians for the
violence, even though 330 Palestinians have died compared to 41 Israelis, and
that 17,000 Palestinians, 4,200 of them children, have been seriously wounded,
as opposed to 150 wounded on the Israeli side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>

        was a bright summer day on the 8th of June, 1967. The United States Navy
        intelligence ship, the U.S.S. Liberty, was peacefully sailing on the
        clear waters of the eastern Mediterranean. It just so happened that on
        that very day, the government of Israel was finalizing its preparations
        for the invasion of Syria which was planned for the following day. The
        intelligence ship's full-time mission was the interception of all radio
        communications in the area, <b>so a decision was made by the Israeli
        government that the U.S.S. Liberty presented a threat to the secrecy of
        their war plans.</b> On that fateful day <b>Israeli warplanes and
        torpedo boats attacked the U.S.S. Liberty with a merciless barrage of
        torpedos, machine gun fire, rockets, and napalm.</b> They attacked her
        in wave after wave, again and again and again. They blasted a 40-foot
        hole in the side of the ship with their torpedoes. When the Liberty
        failed to sink they sent in helicopter gunships and machine-gunned the
        lifeboats. <b>The clear intent of the attackers was that no American be
        left alive. </b>The attack took place in broad daylight and lasted for
        over two hours. Only when the Sixth Fleet had sent rescue aircraft did
        the attackers finally withdraw. <b>All through the assault, the ship was
        flying a clearly visible and brand new American flag.</b> Israeli
        reconnaissance planes had been tracking the Liberty for five and one
        half hours prior to the attack. 171 American sailors were casualties,
        and 34 were killed.</span></font>
