It envisions an integral human formation of the youth who will become mature Christian and active member of the Church. This integral human formation is directed towards a Christian development of knowledge, skills and attitudes which is geared towards service in the church and in society by witnessing the value of God's kingdom. In order to realize this vision, the schools orient and direct thier programs and activities towards the  promotion of human dignity and happiness which lead to the development of the total person who is able to take up his/her responsibilities in the Church and in the world. Having a specific concept of the person and the world as revealed in the Judeo-Christian Tradition, the  schools promote specific outlook on self, others, material world, and God, which changes basically the goal of every human activity and distinguishes it from any other educational system. Having been founded by the CICM Institute, every CICM educational, institution lives up to its missionary identity. Each member of the school community is fully aware of his/her responsibility to reach out to our  separated brothers and sisters and establish fraternal relations with them because there is only one Gospel, one Lord, and one Father of all Inspired and compelled by the attitude of jesus, it gives special attention to the oppressed, the disadvantaged handicapped.
