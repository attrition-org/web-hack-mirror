in the Yugoslav kingdom</font></b></a><font class="f2unbold" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
<p><font class="f2unbold" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">When
the constitution of this new state was finally settled in June 1921, Bosnia
retained no formal status of its own; however, its outline was preserved on the
map, in the form of six <i>oblasti</i> (provinces) corresponding to the sanjaks
(excluding that of Novi Pazar) of the late Ottoman period. Serfdom was
abolished, but Bosnia remained something of a social and political backwater in
the Yugoslav kingdom. In the territorial division of 1929, Bosnia was divided
between four other administrative districts and thus was wiped off the map.
Further adjustments were made in 1939, with the creation of a special Croatian
territory within Yugoslavia that included portions of Bosnian territory. In
1941, after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, the entire Bosnian territory was
absorbed into the puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia.</font></p>
<p><font class="f2unbold" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">The
killing that took place in Bosnia between 1941 and 1945 was terrible in both
scale and complexity. The Usta<u>s</u>a, the fascist movement that ruled Croatia
during the war, <b>exterminated most of Bosnia's 14,000 Jews and massacred Serbs
on a large scale: more than 100,000 Serbs from Bosnia died in this way, roughly
half in death camps</b>. Two organized resistance movements emerged, a Serb
royalist force known as the Chetniks, led by Dra<u>z</u>a Mihailovi<u>c</u>, and
the communist Partisan force (including Serbs, Croats, and Muslims) led by Josip
Broz Tito. The sharply divergent aims of the two movements resulted in a civil
war. Royalist forces turned increasingly to German and <b>Italian forces for
assistance and committed atrocities against Bosnian Muslims</b>; some Bosnian
Muslims joined an SS division that operated in northern and eastern Bosnia for
six months during 1944, exacting reprisals against the local Serb population.
The Partisans liberated Sarajevo in April 1945 and declared a &quot;people's
government&quot; for Bosnia later that month. <b>It is estimated that the total
number of deaths in Bosnia during the war was 164,000 Serbs, 75,000 Muslims, and
64,000 Croats.</b></font></p>
