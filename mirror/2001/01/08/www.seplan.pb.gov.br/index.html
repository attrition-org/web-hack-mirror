<p align="center">Here we are again..... defacers defacing.
We´re the trash of the world, really! The world´d be very happy
without us..</p>

<p align="center">It´s right, isn´t it, FBI? It´s what you
want to hear, isn´t it? WE are bad, aren´t we? The president,
the majors and all the others politicians are nice people, who
want to make the world a good place to live, but WE, hackers,
don´t let the world be a nice place, right? that´s true, in´t
that? (tags are so boring, aren´t they? =). Yes, there are many
people dying hungry, because we hack! If it wasn´t us, the
world´d be a very nice place, everyone would be happy, no one´d
be poor, everybody´d eat a lot and get many gifts on Christmas,
there´d happen no wars, Africa wouldn´t be poor.... yeah... the
World would be wonderful! But we don´t let it happens! We´re
very bad, really!</p>
