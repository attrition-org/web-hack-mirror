        Caffeine-Miscarriage, Marijuana-Infertility Links<p></font><font face="Arial" size="3">December

        </p>
        <p>Two recent studies suggest that caffeine may increase the chances for miscarriage early
        in pregnancy and that marijuana may act to prevent conception.<br>
        <br>
        In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the
        Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that caffeine in the equivalent of one to three
        cups of American coffee a day increases the risk of miscarriages in the first 12 weeks of
        pregnancy by about 30 percent, and that five or more cups doubles the risk. (The
        equivalencies were adjusted for the typically stronger Swedish coffee.)<br>
        <br>
        The study attempted to account for the effects of morning sickness, which keeps many women
        off coffee and which generally indicates healthy fetuses, thereby possibly accounting for
        more unhealthy fetuses among coffee drinkers. Even if somewhat skewed by morning sickness,
        the study's results were viewed as the strongest yet to suggest that pregnant women should
        avoid or limit caffeine in their diet. <br>
        <br>
        The director of the study, Dr. Sven Cnattingius, suggested that pregnant women should
        curtail their consumption to two cups of American coffee per day.<br>
        <br>
        In the other study, conducted by researchers at the State University of New York at
        Buffalo, and presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology, it
        was shown that chemicals in marijuana, cannabinoids, which mimic our bodies' own
        endocannabinoid compounds, may interfere with the sperms' ability to fertilize the woman's
        egg.<br>
        <br>
        It has been known for years that male marijuana smokers have lower sperm counts, but this
        research suggests that smoking marijuana may have a greater impact on fertility than
        earlier believed.<br>
        <br>
        THC--a cannabinoid in marijuana that makes people feel high--and an endocannabinoid called
        anadamide, both affect the fertilizing potential of human sperm. When the group measured
        the presence of anadamide in three reproductive fluids that the sperm comes into contact
        with on its path to fertilize an egg, they found that anadamide was present in all three
        fluids, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system regulates fertilization--and that
        smoking marijuana might upset that system. <br>
        <br>
        All the subtle chemical changes that the sperm and egg undergo in order for there to be a
        successful fertilization are not fully understood, but, according to one of the
        researchers ``if you have a finely tuned regulatory system in the body and a person smokes
        marijuana--thereby taking in high concentrations of all these cannabinoid chemicals that
        bind to these various receptors in the body--this activity can have impacts on the normal
        function of that system.'' <br>
        <br>
        If the endocannabinoid system plays a big role in fertilization, which has yet to be
        proven, then the intaking of cannabinoids may well cause a percentage of the infertility
        in men and women for which the reason has yet to be determined. <br>
