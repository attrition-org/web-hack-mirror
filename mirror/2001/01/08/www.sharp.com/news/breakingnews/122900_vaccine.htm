        Alzheimer Vaccine May Treat Memory Loss<p></font><font face="Arial" size="3">December 29,

        </p>
        <p>Continued research on an experimental Alzheimer's vaccine, which last year was shown to
        block the formation of beta amyloid peptide plaques in mice, has indicated that it may be
        helpful for treating memory loss as well.<br>
        <br>
        Reported in Nature magazine, two independent studies (at the University of South Florida
        in Tampa and the University of Toronto) found the vaccine can largely ward off memory loss
        in mice stricken with a similar disease. ``This potentially could be a major breakthrough
        for us,'' said Zaven Khachaturian, senior science adviser to the Alzheimer's Association. <br>
        <br>
        But he stressed that treatments that work in mice do not necessarily help people and that
        the mouse research did not deal with some key mental abilities lost in Alzheimer's, such
        as language and judgment. <br>
        <br>
        The studies used strains of mice that develop beta amyloid plaques in their brains, along
        with measurable memory deficits, because of the genes they carry.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers used different versions of a procedure in which the mice swam until they
        learned the location of an underwater exit platform. The animals were then tested to see
        how well they remembered where the platform was. Alzheimer's patients frequently have
        trouble remembering locations and how to get to places. <br>
        <br>
        Both studies found that mice that had been repeatedly vaccinated performed markedly better
        than the untreated plaque-forming mice in the memory tests. On some occasions they did as
        well or nearly as well as ordinary mice.<br>
        <br>
        As well as raising optimism that the vaccine is as effective on behavior as it is on
        reducing plaque build-up, the latest trials reinforce the theory that the plaque and
        dementia are in some way linked.<br>
        <br>
        The vaccine is already being tested for safety in people. This past July, drug company
        scientists announced that preliminary results in human patients indicated the vaccine was
        safe. Those tests were not designed to assess any effect on symptoms. <br>
        <br>
        The researchers who carried out the mouse studies said it is not clear why the vaccine
        protects memory. <br>
