            <font SIZE="5"><b><p></b></font><strong>Settlement reached in Grossmont Hospital lease
            lawsuit</strong><br>
            <em>Three-year legal dispute ends amicably</em><br>
            <br>
            The Grossmont Healthcare District, Grossmont Hospital Corporation and Sharp HealthCare
            have settled a lawsuit filed by the district to overturn the May 29, 1991, 30-year lease
            of Grossmont Hospital to Sharp HealthCare. The settlement, benefiting both the hospital
            and the district, ends a three-year legal dispute and was reached on Jan. 3 after months
            of negotiations. <br>
            <br>
            The district built Grossmont Hospital in 1955 and operated it independently until 1991. In
            1991, the district entered into an affiliation with Sharp HealthCare that was designed to
            provide Grossmont Hospital with the advantages of being part of Sharp's regional network
            of hospitals. As part of the affiliation, the district entered into a lease agreement
            giving control of the hospital to Grossmont Hospital Corporation. The legality of the
            lease was challenged in 1997. An issue related to that challenge is currently pending
            action at the state Supreme Court.<br>
            <br>
            The parties involved agree that the settlement is in the best interests of the communities
            they mutually serve and assures that Grossmont Hospital will remain affiliated with Sharp
            HealthCare through May 2021.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The district has achieved its goal of reforming the lease to reflect terms it
            believes are needed to assure Grossmont Hospital is able to serve the community long into
            the future and after the affiliation with Sharp HealthCare ends,&quot; said Grossmont
            Healthcare District President Gloria Chadwick.<br>
            <br>
            In announcing the settlement, Chadwick added: &quot;The amended lease provides the
            district with five seats on Sharp's Gross mont Hospital Corporation board of directors
            that oversees the hospital's operations and also assures continued operations of the
            hospital by the district if control of the hospital were to revert to the district for any
            reason.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            According to the terms of the settlement, Grossmont Hospital Corporation will pay $5
            million to the Grossmont Healthcare District and return more than $400,000 in attorneys'
            fees paid to Grossmont Hospital Corporation under a previous court ruling.<br>
            <br>
            Separately, the district will contribute $2.5 million to the Grossmont Hospital
            Foundation's &quot;Partnership for the Future&quot; campaign to build a new Emergency and
            Critical Care Center. This is part of the district's ongoing commitment to the hospital's
            capital campaign. Previously, the district has pledged $1.5 million toward this important
            community project, resulting in a total contribution of $4 million.<br>
            <br>
            Dr. James Carry, chairman of Grossmont Hospital Corporation Board, welcomed the settlement
            of the lawsuit and said, &quot;This settlement demonstrates a mutual respect among the
            parties for their positions and a desire to work collaboratively for the betterment of
            Grossmont Hospital and the community it serves.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The settlement includes an agreement that the parties will join in petitioning the
            California Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal pending at the state Supreme Court and
            ultimately bring the lawsuit to closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
