<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Admin, no files harmed, besides
the syslogs.. holes patched,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">but u need to learn how to keep
up-to-date with the newest</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">security holes for ur deamons/operating-system
!</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Sorry but we need this webspace
to say a few words to the NASA, since we owned a few boxes,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">patched their shit and where there
for them to help, but they don`t give a fuck. They just sent us "Blackdog",
the same guy who busted the sSH crew last year and he now trys to get our
asses. The only thing we wanted is to help, we dont need the attention
for defacing websites or whatever..we dont want to act like the current
defacement scene who all just deface for attention and to get known and
they think if they leave</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">their mail addresses for contact
to help the admins, they wouldn`t be called crackers. cuz if a admin mails</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">them they cant even help em since
they only scan the whole net for unicode and such shit and the only thing</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">they can say is, goto www.microsoft.com
..i mean wtf they even dont know how the exploits work they use</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">since ./exploit www.victim.com
-o 200 isnt very difficult and they dont need to know how the bug actually
works. We arent like that, we like to find our own exploits, cuz its much
more fun and we only deface to show the admin what can happen, since the
most admins dont give a fuck when they recive a mail about some bug until
they see what happens ..so we show it to them b4 crackers do in a evil
way. but the NASA won`t understand the problem.. they just think of we
could have stolen some important data (what we didnt) ..they r scared that
someone could findout stuff they hide from the world and make it public,
since knowledge is power and if u know too much they try to shut ur mouth,
but we wont sit here and watch until u rape us and give the whole situation
a false color ..cuz in fact YOU are the evil ones ! we tryed to help, u
hunt us for that ..</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">what about FREE INFORMATION FOR
EVERYONE ? ..the problem is the admin isnt as smart as he allways said
and now he is pissed since his boss saw what a stupid cunt he is..u hear
me blackdoggy ?!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">They also wanted BrainStorm to
spy on american crews like Icefist aKa Darkness did on us ..but we wont
do such things! We just want to help ppl damnit, if we where evil we just
could use some oc3 roots to blow ur asses away, or setup some stupid DDoS
attacks ..wtf but we think DoS is fuckin lame so u should finally see that
we r not evil ! Thats it ..we hope some of u understand what we mean ..and
thx to all our friends who help/support us ..we wont go down !</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Blackdog, give Icefist head and
shut da fuck up bitchass !</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><u><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=+1>! Special thanks
to 0x7f !</font></font></u></b><b><u><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=+1></font></font></u></b>
