<p><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial">January 12, 2001 :</font></b></p>

<p><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Five Palestinians were wounded by
rubber-coated steel bullets in Ramallah, and two were wounded in Hebron,
according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Two Palestinians were
critically wounded by live ammunition in Khalil, near Hebron, the agency said.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Since September 28, when the latest
round of violence in the 52-year-old conflict began, at least 392 people have
been killed. The Red Crescent Society says that 336 of them were Palestinians,
and the IDF says that 43 were Israeli Jews and 13 Israeli Arabs.</font></b></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#ff0000" size="4">THE DEATH TOLL:</font>
<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="#800000">330 Palestinians
dead, 41 Israelis dead</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="#800000">17,000
Palestinians wounded, About 100 Israelis wounded</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" color="#ff0000" size="4">Big difference
here.&nbsp; And remember, it was Israel that began the current crisis by having
1000 Israeli troops storm the streets of Jerusalem, shooting at everything and
everyone in their way, on Sept. 29.&nbsp; Now Israel has totally closed the West
Bank and Gaza, preventing food, medical supplies, and other humanitarian needs&nbsp;
to reach the victims of Israel's inhumanity, and making life even more of a
nightmare for the Palestinian people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Courier New">Having Israeli
soldiers shoot at Palestinian ambulances, fire missiles at kids, and enforce
economic hardship on the Palestinians is not a good way of promoting peace
m0sad.&nbsp; That only makes the Palestinian people more determined to get their
freedom from you Israeli oppressors.&nbsp; The bombings happen because the
people Israeli oppresses want change.&nbsp; They're sick of seeing their
children being shot dead in cold blood by the sub-human Israeli soldiers.
They're tired of being insulted and abused by the IDF in front of their
children's eyes.&nbsp; They're fed up with Israeli soldiers routinely firing at
their homes, farms, ambulances, etc.&nbsp; All the Palestinians want is their
basic human rights...the right to live in the native land of Palestine they were
born on, the right to be happy, to live life...the very rights Israeli scum deny
them.</font></p>
