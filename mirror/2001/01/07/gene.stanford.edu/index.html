        <br> The issue (the reason we are defacing):<br><br> No issue in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is more emotional than Jerusalem. A big reason: because Judaism's<br> holiest site and Islam's third-holiest site are located within the city's boundaries. Half of the city was under Jordanian control until<br> the 1967 war, when it was reunified after Israel drove Jordan out of the West Bank.<br>

        <br> The Palestinian position (whom we support):<br>

        <br>The Palestinians have always regarded Jerusalem, or Al Quds, as they call it, as the capital of their future state. They want to<br> restore a divide between Israeli and Arab sections, with the religious rights of all guaranteed.<br>

        <br> The Israeli position (whom we are against):<br>

        <br>Israel insists that Jerusalem is its &quot;eternal&quot; capital (although most countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv) and that the city<br> will remain undivided under its control, with rights of religious access guaranteed to all.<br>
