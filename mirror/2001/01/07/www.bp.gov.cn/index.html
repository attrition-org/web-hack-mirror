are defacing):</u></i></b></font></p>

<p class="text"><font color="#FF0000">No issue in the conflict
between Israel and the Palestinians is more emotional than
Jerusalem. A big reason: because Judaism's holiest site and
Islam's third-holiest site are located within the city's
boundaries. Half of the city was under Jordanian control until
the 1967 war, when it was reunified after Israel drove Jordan out
of the West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i><u>The Palestinian position (whom

</font></p>

<p class="text"><font color="#FF0000">The Palestinians have
always regarded Jerusalem, or Al Quds, as they call it, as the
capital of their future state. They want to restore a divide
between Israeli and Arab sections, with the religious rights of
all guaranteed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i><u>The Israeli position (whom we

</font></p>

<p class="text"><font color="#FF0000">Israel insists that
Jerusalem is its &quot;eternal&quot; capital (although most
countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv) and that the city
will remain undivided under its control, with rights of religious
access guaranteed to all.</font></p>

shot dead </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><br>
NEW DELHI, Dec 26: The New Delhi police said on Tuesday they had
shot dead a Muslim militant suspected of being involved in the
assault on the Red Fort. <br>
&quot;An encounter took place early this morning ... in which one
militant was killed and another nabbed in the capital's south
district,&quot; an official of the Delhi police
counter-insurgency cell told AFP. <br>
The shootout took place at 5:40am (0010 GMT) during a raid on a
residential area in south Delhi, the official said, adding that
police had recovered an AK-47 rifle, two grenades and some
ammunition. <br>
The dead militant was identified as Abu Shawal and his captured
comrade as Ashaf Ali, who reportedly gave police the names of six
more people involved in the Red Fort attack on Friday night. Both
men were believed to be Pakistani nationals. <br>
Lashker-i-Taiba - a militant group operating in Occupied Kashmir
- claimed responsibility for Friday's attack, in which three
people, including two army personnel were killed. <br>
The Red Fort houses an army garrison and interrogation center. A
high-level joint police and army probe has been ordered into the
security lapse that allowed the armed militants to approach
undetected. More than 1,000 policemen, soldiers and military
intelligence officials on Tuesday were still carrying out
house-to-house searches in a two-kilometer radius from the fort. <br>
Meanwhile, the Laskher-i-Taiba issued a press release on Tuesday,
threatening a suicide attack against the offices of Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. &quot;Our Mujahideen will storm
Vajpayee's office and carry out a fidayeen (suicide) attack
there,&quot; the Lashker statement said. &quot;If our cadres can
force an entry into Delhi's Red Fort, it will not be an uphill
task to barge into Mr Vajpayees's office.&quot; <br>
Lashkar was among the first militant groups to reject the
unilateral Indian army ceasefire in Kashmir which was ordered by
Prime Minister Vajpayee and came into force at midnight Nov 27. <br>
Last week, Vajpayee extended the cease-fire for another four
weeks. <br>
&quot;The government should leave the politics of cease-fire and
withdraw its troops from Kashmir,&quot; the Lashker release said.
&quot;If India fails to withdraw its troops we will intensify our
fidayeen attacks within India and force it to pull out its
troops.&quot; <br>
Observers say the recent attacks on high-profile targets were
aimed at delivering a clear message that hard-line militant
outfits will not be sidelined by the cease-fire process. <br>
THREAT TO VAJPAYEE: The Lashker-i-Taiba threatened on Tuesday a
suicide attack against the offices of Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee in New Delhi. &quot;Our mujahideen, Allah
willing, will storm Vajpayee's office and carry out a Fidayeen
(suicide) attack there,&quot; the Lashker said in a one-page Urdu
press release. &quot;If our cadres can force an entry into
Delhi's Red Fort, it will not be an uphill task to barge into Mr
Vajpayee's office,&quot; the statement said. <br>
Lashker was among the first groups to reject the unilateral
Indian army cease-fire in occupied Kashmir. <br>
