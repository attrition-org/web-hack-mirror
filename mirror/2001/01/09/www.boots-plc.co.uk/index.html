		Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  <br>
		"Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...<br>
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.<br><br>

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?<br>
        Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?<br>
        I am a hacker, enter my world...<br><br>
        
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br>
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.<br><br>

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.<br>
        I understand it.  "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."<br>
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.<br><br>

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is cool.<br>
        It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.<br>
        Not because it doesn't like me...<br>
        Or feels threatened by me...<br>
        Or thinks I'm a smart ass...<br>
        Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...<br>
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.<br><br>

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... <br>
        rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, <br>
        an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.<br>
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."<br>
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...<br>
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...<br><br>

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak...<br>
        the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. <br>
        We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.<br>
        The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.<br><br>

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.<br>
        We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons,<br>
        and you call us criminals. <br>
        We explore... and you call us criminals.  <br>
        We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.<br>
        We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.<br>
		You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us,<br>
		you try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.<br><br>

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.<br>
        My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.<br>
		My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.<br><br>

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.<br>
        You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.<br><br>
