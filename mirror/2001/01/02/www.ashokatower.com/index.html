<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">SRINAGAR, Dec
26: Fourteen people, including four Indian soldiers, were killed and 31
others injured in a car bomb blast on Monday and in an ambush by Mujahideen
in occupied Kashmir on Tuesday.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">A police spokesman
said a patrol of the 32nd Rashtriya Rifles unit was attacked in the Kupwara
district. "The patrol was passing the village of Wavoora Lolab," about
100km from here, when they were ambushed, he said. The troops returned
the gunfire but four soldiers died and eight others injured, he said.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">On Monday,
10 people were killed when Mujahideen set off the powerful car bomb near
an army zone here, police and witnesses said.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">Two groups
claimed responsibility for the explosion, with one of them asserting the
attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who had traveled from Britain
for the mission.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">A police spokesman
said six Indian soldiers, three civilians and a freedom fighter were among
those killed.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">At least 23
others were injured in the attack in Srinagar's fortified Badami Bagh army
cantonment district.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">The previously-unknown
Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen was the first to claim responsibility for the blast,
adding that the attackers had escaped unharmed.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">The Jaish-i-Mohammad
also said it was responsible. It identified the attacker as Abu Abdullah
from Birmingham, Britain. They said he was on a suicide mission and died
in the blast. Srinagar's police chief, however, rejected the claim and
said the attack was conducted with the help of a remote-controlled device.
He said the blast occurred outside the cantonment gates near a Srinagar
shopping mall.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">The army headquarters
here said the attack was aimed at sabotaging an ongoing Indian process
to restore peace in occupied Kashmir. "In efforts to disrupt and annul
the ongoing peace negotiations, which are gaining momentum and strengthening
with each passing day, militants (Mujahideen) from an as yet unidentified
group detonated a car bomb," the army said in a statement.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">The Christmas
blast is the second car bomb attack in the cantonment area this year. In
April, a Jaish-i-Mohammad suicide bomber detonated a car there, killing
seven soldiers and injuring several civilians.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">And militants
of the pan-Islamic Lashkar-i-Taiba stormed the army headquarters last month,
killing four soldiers and three army officials.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FF0000">Indian Home
Minister Lal Krishna Advani on Monday blamed Pakistan for the attacks during
the Ramazan ceasefire. Violence is very much on in the (held) state. The
Lashkar-i-Taiba is still active but the group cannot function if Pakistan
in all honesty puts a stop to its activities. "Pakistan should talk to
the militant groups and stop the killing of innocent people," Advani said.-AFP</font></font>
