<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">NEW DELHI,
Dec 26: The New Delhi police said on Tuesday they had shot dead a Muslim
militant suspected of being involved in the assault on the Red Fort.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">"An encounter
took place early this morning ... in which one militant was killed and
another nabbed in the capital's south district," an official of the Delhi
police counter-insurgency cell told AFP.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">The shootout
took place at 5:40am (0010 GMT) during a raid on a residential area in
south Delhi, the official said, adding that police had recovered an AK-47
rifle, two grenades and some ammunition.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">The dead militant
was identified as Abu Shawal and his captured comrade as Ashaf Ali, who
reportedly gave police the names of six more people involved in the Red
Fort attack on Friday night. Both men were believed to be Pakistani nationals.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">Lashker-i-Taiba
- a militant group operating in Occupied Kashmir - claimed responsibility
for Friday's attack, in which three people, including two army personnel
were killed.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">The Red Fort
houses an army garrison and interrogation center. A high-level joint police
and army probe has been ordered into the security lapse that allowed the
armed militants to approach undetected. More than 1,000 policemen, soldiers
and military intelligence officials on Tuesday were still carrying out
house-to-house searches in a two-kilometer radius from the fort.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">Meanwhile,
the Laskher-i-Taiba issued a press release on Tuesday, threatening a suicide
attack against the offices of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
"Our Mujahideen will storm Vajpayee's office and carry out a fidayeen (suicide)
attack there," the Lashker statement said. "If our cadres can force an
entry into Delhi's Red Fort, it will not be an uphill task to barge into
Mr Vajpayees's office."</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">Lashkar was
among the first militant groups to reject the unilateral Indian army ceasefire
in Kashmir which was ordered by Prime Minister Vajpayee and came into force
at midnight Nov 27.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">Last week,
Vajpayee extended the cease-fire for another four weeks.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">"The government
should leave the politics of cease-fire and withdraw its troops from Kashmir,"
the Lashker release said. "If India fails to withdraw its troops we will
intensify our fidayeen attacks within India and force it to pull out its
troops."</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">Observers say
the recent attacks on high-profile targets were aimed at delivering a clear
message that hard-line militant outfits will not be sidelined by the cease-fire
process.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33"></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#33FF33">THREAT TO VAJPAYEE:
The Lashker-i-Taiba threatened on Tuesday a suicide attack against the
offices of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in New Delhi. "Our
