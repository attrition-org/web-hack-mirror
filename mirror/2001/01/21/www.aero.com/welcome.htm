<FONT COLOR="770000"><b><I>That's right!</I>  Aero.com is NOT a travel  agency (been there - done that). Our aviation page was getting too many inquiries about <i>"INEXPENSIVE TRAVEL"</i>, so.... there was a need for a starting point for research. If you have more info geared toward letting someone else fly, please share it with us and we will post the URL info. Of course if this type of travel is too commercial and non-adventurous consider going into debt like the rest of us get a pilots license.</b><p>
