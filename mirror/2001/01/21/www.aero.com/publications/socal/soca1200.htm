          <P>In Part 135 operations, pilots are on tight and constantly changing schedules. Customers' needs, unfamiliar airports and limited planning time put additional pressures on the pilots. The following are some safety strategies I've learned in this challenging environment.</P>
          <P>Before starting your engines, look at the airport layout and determine your destination on the field. Check if runways cross. Is there a runway between the one in use and your position? Be alert at unfamiliar airports, especially if there are multiple runways.</P>
          <P>Focused attention must begin at the start of an approach. Knowing whether to exit the runway left or right before you are on the ground will prevent confusing situations which can result in accidentally entering another runway without a clearance.</P>
          <P>At uncontrolled fields, people don't always give position reports. A good procedure is to:<BR>
          <UL>
            <LI>Identify the airport first
            <LI>Look for wind direction and other airplanes in the pattern or on the ground as described in the AIM
            <LI>Scan the airport for possible departures
            <LI>Use extra caution if you are faster than the local traffic.

            <B><FONT size="+1">Best Practices for Clear Communications</FONT></B><BR>
            <I>Kathleen O'Brien Powell</I>
          </P>
          <P>Recently, I had the opportunity to attend <B>Communicating for Safety</B>, a two-day conference sponsored by NATCA  (National Air Traffic Controllers Association.) More than 300 controllers from towers, approach control and centers met in Atlanta.</P>
          <P>These dedicated specialists came together to discuss and explore best practices for modernizing our air traffic control system while maintaining and expanding safety for all the flying public. For now, radio transmitting is the way for pilots and controllers to communicate to each other clearly and specifically.</P>
          <P>Radio transmissions form the lifeline of our air traffic control system. This lifeline is the medium through which pilots and controllers "see" each other and connect. We pilots use these communications to understand what to expect and what is expected of us.</P>
          <P>As air traffic density increases, both pilots and controllers are concerned about the quality and quantity of communications within our air traffic control system.</P>
          <P>Ineffective communication often results in poor cooperation, coordination, tension and an increased possibility for errors. Stepping on others' transmissions and using poor radio procedures result in radio blocking and communication errors. These errors have contributed to many aircraft accidents and incidents.</P>
          <P>Consider adopting the following strategies to support your own safety and improve Air Traffic Control communications.</P>
          <UL>
            <LI><B>Communication is a two way street.</B> It involves giving information and getting feedback. Without feedback or readback, the communication isn't finished.</LI>
            <LI><B>Study and use standard phraseology.</B> Don't rely on quick or incomplete communications, even if they sound friendly.</LI>
            <LI><B>Ask ourselves each time we transmit</B> if the message is clear. Example: Give an accurate position report, not just a general location. Use VFR checkpoints on our charts, the ones marked by magenta flags such as over Canyon Reservoir, Queens Gate, the Rose Bowl, Point Dume and El Monte Airport.</LI>
            <LI><B>View our transmission as a "service to"</B> the controller. This way you are most likely to get back the service you need from ATC.</LI>
            <LI><B>Listen and show respect for others on the frequency.</B> Consider them part of your safety team. By using a respectful tone of voice, your transmission is more apt to get the response you need. Key way: Ask questions or clarification when there is the slightest confusion.</LI>
            <LI><B>Don't just expect courtesy,</B> give it and give it consistently with every transmission.</LI>
            <LI><B>When you have a question or concern</B> that is best not discussed over the radio, call the ATC facility after the flight and ask.</LI>
            <LI><B>Be sure each transmission you make is accurate</B> and to the point. If you have an urgent condition, let ATC know.</LI>
            <LI><B>Concentrate on your communication manner.</B> A professional tone, measured speed and appropriate phraseology will contribute to assuring your continued safety.</LI>

          <UL>
            <LI><B>Treat your passengers like valued customers for your business.</B> Perhaps that means giving them suggestions about suitable clothing for the trip. Let them know early about luggage weight restrictions and why you have them.</LI>
            <LI><B>View passengers as partners</B> and members of your flying team. Enlist them in looking for traffic or listening for your aircraft call sign.</LI>

<P>R.C. Morton, Safety Program Manager
<P>In January of 2000, the Riverside FSDO disassoci-ated from the monthly SOCAL Newsletter mailed to every pilot in the Los Angeles and Inland Empire area. The Riverside FSDO started printing and dis-tributing their own newsletter to advertise the various safety programs and meetings that were exclusively sponsored by the Riverside FSDO.  This newsletter was mailed only to pilots living in the Riverside FSDO boundaries. The separate newsletter was created to provide the Riverside FSDO more space to better describe and advertise their programs in hopes that it would increase participation.   As it was, the SOCAL newsletter provided limited space with all FSDOs attempting to advertise their pro-grams within only a four page newsletter.  The crea-tion of a separate newsletter did increase atten-dance at Riverside but there was a price.</P>
<P>Many aviators living close to the borders of the Riv-erside's district were now receiving only the River-side FSDO's newsletter and not the SOCAL.  This became a problem to some pilots in the area.</P>
<P>Some pilots lived close to airports outside our boundaries and it was more convenient for them to travel to safety meetings held by other FSDOs. It appeared there was no good way to resolve the problem because of the unique way in which news-letters are mailed.  The mailing is not handled locally  Since the size of the SOCAL newsletter was re-stricted by budget constraints, something needed to  be done.  Another source of money for the SOCAL newsletter was found and it will soon be expanded in size and will again include the Riverside FSDO's programming.</P>
<P>Starting January 2001, the Riverside FSDO will no longer publish their own independent newsletter.   We will again be listing all of our programs in the "new" SOCAL.  This should solve the mailing prob-lems and provide all Riverside FSDO's district pilots information about programs sponsored by other FSDOs that may be of interest to them.</P>
<P>Hopefully this transition will go smoothly and the "new" SOCAL will fulfill all the needs of the offices involved as well as keep all the Southern California pilots apprised of happenings throughout the area.</P>
