      <P><B>Specialized Seminar February 1st, 2001; <I>Aerial Applicators Safety Briefing</I></B>. We give tribute to the districts professional aerial applicators by providing them with a specifically constructed seminar centering on the topics of drift, corrosion of aircraft, and ground handling. This program is Calif. State approved for CECPM credit and is co-sponsered by CAAA. If you know an Ag-pilot, please urge him to attend.</P>
      <P><B>Announcing Fresno's "Annual State of the District" Presentation.</B> (see the <A href="#FAT_FSDO">Safety Schedule</A> below)
We begin our New Year with our much-requested review of the accidents, incidents, pilot deviations and events in calendar year 2000. We will be looking for common threads that hopefully fellow aviators will head and learn from, so they too, do not become a statistic. Be sure to attend this most informative program.</P>
      <P><B><A name="FAT_BFL"></A>Notice! To All General Aviation, Corporate Aviation, and Part 135 Pilots operating into or out of BFL! SMGCS is now operating at Bakersfield Meadows Airport!</B>

The Bakersfield (BFL) Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS) Plan has been approved and is operational whenever the airports RVR visibility drops below 1200.
This notice is to remind you to obtain, read and become totally familiar with Bakersfield Meadows SMGCS plan if you intend to operate on the airports movement area (taxi for takeoff) your aircraft during Low Visibility Operations. <BR>
        Last December this office, did a special edition direct mailing to most Bakersfield operators to notify them of this new procedure.
         Copies of the entire plan may be obtained from BFL-ATCT at 661-399-3531 or through the Internet at <A href="http://www.awp.faa.gov/fsdo/fresno/no_local.htm">http://www.awp.faa.gov/fsdo/fresno/no_local.htm</A></P>
      <P><B><A name="FAT_FAT"></A>Fresno Yosemite Int'l Airport initiates new taxiway signage!</B>
As of this writing (Dec 20th), FAT has completed installation of all of its new assignment and signage of the taxiways of the airport. The next time you land here at FAT, you may find the layout a little bit different.<BR>
        Basically, the major changes are as follows:
      <OL compact>
        <LI>Parallel Taxiways A,B,C--No change
        <LI>Other Taxiways
          <OL type="i" compact>
            <LI>Taxiway Letter + Increasing Numbers from SE to NW ie. B-2; B-3; B-4; etc.
            <LI>SW of 29R all Bravo's
            <LI>NE of 29R All Charlie's
          </OL>
        <LI>General Aviation  Ramp to the Alpha Taxiway
          <OL type="i" compact>
            <LI>Numbers 1-6 from the Tower to the FSDO
          </OL>
      </OL>
      <P><B><I>What Else is New to Fresno?</I></B>
Category IIIb ILS to Runway 29R (CAT II scheduled Nov. 20 and CAT III Jan or Feb 2001. These improvements will help mostly air carriers by reducing Decision Altitude from 200' to an Alert Height of 100' and landing minimum visibility from 1,800' to 600'. Unfortunately, because of special approval, maintenance, training and equipment it is not much help to most General Aviation operations. However, the new approach lighting systems should benefit all IFR landing operations for all IFR pilots. Most importantly, all IFR pilots must be knowledgeable of the special taxi restrictions when CAT III approaches are in use.

<BR>
        <I>Review the  FAT taxiway chart and be sure to refer to it before your flight into Fresno.</I>

News Flash! Get hold of this 'just off the press' Bulletin HBGA 00-18, issued Dec 18, 2000. It's title is <I>Procedures for Renewing a Flight Instructor Certificate on the Basis of Participation in the FAA's Pilot Proficiency Awards Program (<B>WINGS</B>)</I>. It basically authorizes a CFI to apply for certificate renewal provided he/she is able to document WINGS  flight training to at least five (5) pilots and at least a total of fifteen (15) hours of WINGS  flight training.

      <B>Question:</B>  What is the meaning of airworthy?

<B><BR>
      Answer:</B>  Two conditions must be met for a standard category aircraft to be considered airworthy.  These conditions are:<BR>
      </P>
      <UL compact>
        <LI>The aircraft conforms to its type design (type certificate).  Conformity to its type design is considered attained when the required and proper components are installed, and they are consistent with the drawings, specifications, and other data that are part of the type certificate.  Conformity would include applicable Supplemental Type Certificates (STC's) and field-approved alterations.
        <LI>The aircraft is in condition for safe operation.  This refers to the condition of the aircraft with relation to wear and deterioration

      <P>Dear AMT,<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with great pleasure that I introduce the 2001 Fresno Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) published maintenance newsletter that will be distributed quarterly.  The emphasis of the safety program newsletter is to ensure that mechanics, operators, and air agencies are provided with a yearly schedule of program topics.  Topics that promote safety for aviation maintenance activities.
<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is often stated by many aviation maintenance directors that AMT's are the "Unsung Hero's of Aviation."  Why?… AMT's must stay current with the high tech changes affecting aviation maintenance.  They must deal with and control the effects of human factors. The AMT must learn and apply which 'Safety Nets' are required to keep themselves safe, stay employed, meet "gate times," and stay in compliance with the FAR's.  While balancing and dealing with the above-mentioned factors, the AMT still remains responsible and accountable for the airworthiness of the aircraft he/she is maintaining.
<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aviation industry must depend upon the AMT to maintain high maintenance standards. Maintaining this standard may be accomplished through continuous education.  The educational strategy that I, as Safety Program Manager (SPM), will be implementing is to provide the local AMT's with continuing education of regulatory requirements. Your participation will ensure success for all of us involved in aviation maintenance safety.
<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any changes or revisions for future topics will be addressed in the quarterly newsletter, and via the Internet. (<A href="http://www.awp.faa.gov/fsdo/fresno">http://www.awp.faa.gov/fsdo/fresno</A>).
<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As your Fresno FSDO Safety Program Manager (Airworthiness), I am looking forward to meeting with you and discussing the varied topics that are planned throughout the year.

      <P>Any time we take an aircraft aloft we have a slight chance of coming down in a manner which would normally be unacceptable.  In other words we might crash.  I have heard it said if a person is prepared he or she will not have as much fear.  With that in mind I added this list, just to help in case you encounter one of those sweaty palm moments or days as the case may be.

      <P><B>P.S.</B> Pilots who file a flight plan are usually found in 24 hours after being lost in an accident.  Pilots who do not file a flight plan 'if found' average 72 hours before they are found.  Very Pro'found'.

      <H4>WINGS: An excellent way to gain proficiency</H4>
      <P>WINGS is the FAA Pilot Proficiency Award Program designed to encourage general aviation
    pilots to continue their training. It provides an opportunity to practice selected
    maneuvers in a minimum of instruction time.</P>
      <P>WINGS is an excellent opportunity for you to re-evaluate your flight proficiency and
    knowledge.</P>
      <H4>If You're a Pilot, You're Eligible</H4>
      <P>WINGS is open to all pilots holding a recreational certificate or higher with a current
    medical certificate, when required. After you've logged three hours of dual instruction
    under the program and attend at least one FAA-sanctioned safety seminar you will be
    eligible to receive and wear a distinctive set of WINGS. You will also receive a
    certificate of completion. </P>
      <P>Pilots: Your attendance at safety seminars fulfills one of the requirements of the
    Pilot Proficiency Award program (Wings Program). Completion of the requirements of the
    Wings Program, as outlined in Advisory Circular 61.91g, will qualify you to receive a
    Wings lapel pin and wall certificate. ADDITIONALLY, if you satisfactorily complete a phase
    of the Wings Program within the period specified by Section 61.56 of the Federal Aviation
    Regulations, you need not accomplish a biennial flight review.</P>
      <H4>More Wings To Work For</H4>
      <P>Each twelve month interval after earning your first set of WINGS you will be eligible

    for more WINGS. Each WINGS pin is specially designed to mark your additional progress.</P>
      <H4>WINGS-The Sign of a Safe Pilot</H4>
      <P>It's a fact - recurrent training makes a difference. Statistics show that pilots who

    participate in recurrent training programs such as WINGS, have a much better safety record

    than the pilots who do not. Earning your WINGS could have a positive impact on your

    aviation insurance costs. Be sure to inform your insurance agent of your commitment to the

    WINGS Program</P>
