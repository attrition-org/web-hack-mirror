It's time for an evaluation and the only evaluator available has a reputation of being a little 
strict. Yuck.  Like most people I want my instructors to be really tough and my evaluators 
to be really easy.  And, if an instructor and the student does his or her job correctly, that's 
exactly how the evaluation will go; easy.  I include the student as having responsibility 
because they have an equal share in the learning process.  A student should not allow the 
instructor to be lazy by not teaching and the instructor should not allow the student to be 
lazy by not challenging.  The learning process is a commitment both instructor and student 
have made to the successful increase of knowledge.  <p>

What kind of things should instructors be teaching and what kind of things should 
evaluators be evaluating?  <p>

An instructor should teach unselfishly everything they know about flying.  This includes 
aircraft characteristics and performance, flying techniques, aeromedical, and  
aerodynamics.  The key is using the building block principle and starting with basics before 
moving to more advanced techniques.  This is where patience is important.  The student 
and the instructor are sometimes in a hurry to do more exciting stuff and if not handled 
correctly, this may be detrimental to the learning process.  <p>

So why on earth would you need to know basic stuff like aerodynamics to fly a helicopter?  
Well truthfully,  the darn thing will fly for the most ignorant slob out there, (you don't 
need to understand Newton's Laws of Motion to drive a car).  And as a friend of mine 
used to say, "I never could see all them little arrows while I'm flying."  However, in the 
course of flying helicopters, you may one day, through your ignorance, put yourself in a 
situation you wouldn't have, if you only understood the principles involved in 
aerodynamics.  For example, You're at a high altitude and are heavy with cargo and 
without thinking you begin your approach down wind.  <b>Did you bump your 
head??</b>  If you understand the basics in aerodynamics, you would never put yourself 
in this situation.  By understanding how things work, we can make use of things to their 
full potential.    <p>

So what do I look for when I'm evaluating?  Competence, professionalism.  Pretty vague 
concepts, however if a pilot possess those, then passing an eval is usually no problem.  
Bottom line: Would I trust this person to fly my family?  I'm very serious about 
administering evaluations.  Friendship, or friendliness, has no place in an honest 
evaluation.  <p>

<b><u>Oral Evaluation</u></b><p>

I like to begin an evaluation by first giving the pilot a route to plan with some purpose in 
mind such as delivering equipment or people.  By doing this I can evaluate the planning 
sequence.  Did they adequately review aircraft performance, weight and balance, and 
required equipment?  I then will ask questions about the takeoff, enroute and arrival.  
Using this method, I can cover everything a pilot should be of concern to the pilot.  I can 
also begin to understand the thought process of the examinee.  <p>

The questions will vary depending on what type of duty the pilot is performing.  I usually 
begin with departure procedures.  <p>
<ul>
<li> What are your fuel requirements?

<li> Can we legally do the mission?

<li> Will we be within CG the entire route?  If not, what are our options?

<li> What class airspace in the departure airport in?  

<li> Then, what are the requirements for departure?  The answer will vary depending on 
the airport of course.  
</ul>
<p>
What I want to know is does the pilot understand  the procedures and can they effectively 
use them.  (This is good to know before we climb in the aircraft.)  Enroute is next and first 
I'll cover airspace.  I specifically want to know if the pilot can safely operate in today's 
airspace without breaking any rules. <p>

For instance, does the pilot know their cloud clearance and visibility requirements, 
communication requirements and equipment requirements.  Can he or she effectively make 
decisions regarding alternatives if some of the requirements are not met?   Then depending 
on the area, I like to go to altitude.  Into the mountains.  The mission might be an external 
or internal load.   <p>
	<ul>
<li> Does the mission go above 10,000 feet MSL and how will that change any 
requirements?  

<li> How will that change performance requirements?  

<li> How about physiological requirements such as oxygen?  

<li> What are indication of winds?  

<li> What methods can I employ to ascertain wind direction if it is not obvious?  

<li> What about other weather concerns like clouds and lightning?  

<li> What if lightning strikes the aircraft?  What sort of indications will I get and what 
should be my response?  
</ul>
<p>
Upon arrival, were faced with a new set of questions.  Have you met the power 
requirements? What will happen if during my approach I land downwind?  Why?  How 
can I recover?<p>

<li> If the landing area is unprepared, how will I make the approach?<p>

<b><u>Flight Evaluation</u></b><p>

Preflight is usually the first part of the flight portion of the eval.  During this phase I watch 
the examinee and ask questions about components of the aircraft.  I might even discuss 
aerodynamics at this point.  Another technique I use will be to ask what a component is 
and what would happen if that component failed.  What are the indications, limitations and 
emergency procedures as appropriate?<P>
	
I like to fly the route that the examinee planned and if possible do the entire mission.  This 
just reinforces all the planning and makes the examinee feel that they didn't waste their 
time.  It's my job to make sure the examinee performs all the maneuvers required, so I try 
to include them in the flight.  While flying, I'll ask more questions regarding the mission 
and the aircraft to see how the examinee handles distraction.  Most people don't realize 
how important this is.  The examinee is already in a stressful situation just by being 
evaluated.  I intentionally increase the stress to evaluate what happens.  I never do this 
right away.  I prefer to let the pilot relax a little and get into the flight first.  Let them get 
through the stress of an evaluation and add a different type of stress.  Any abnormal 
response might be cause for me to dig a little deeper.  (So stay cool fool.) <p>

There are a couple things a pilot can do to receive an unsat during the flight.  One is to 
mess up an engine failure in a single engine helicopter.  My philosophy is that you only get 
one chance in real life so you get one chance on the eval.  Choosing the wrong landing 
isn't automatically a no go,  but not getting the collective down or not monitoring airspeed 
is.  The mechanics are what I really worry about.  I'm not going to be able to correct this 
fault with just a verbal correction and try it again attitude.  This person should practice 
more engine failures and auto's before be re-evaluated.<p>

Another unsat would be if the pilot continually is unable to maintain the minimum 
standards set forth in the guidelines for evaluation.  For me one excursion is not an unsat 
unless airspace is violated.  However if during the flight the examinee clearly demonstrates 
his inability to maintain adequate aircraft control, then I'm sorry, come back and see me 
later.  <p>

<b><u>Debrief</u></b><p>

This is where the evaluator really earns his money.  A thorough debrief of the flight is a 
great teaching tool.  Some debriefs are short and quick because the examinee was not 
observed doing anything poorly.  Some are lengthy because they were.<p>

<b><u>Conclusion</u></b><p>

Well that's my story and I'm stickin to it.  There's no way for a person to know everything, 
so if someone doesn't know the answer to an obscure question, that's just an opportunity 
to teach and learn.  Because really, teaching is one of the best ways to learn something.  I 
use this technique sometimes.  I have my students teach me.  I know I still have a lot to 
learn.  If I'm not learning, then I'm stagnating and in danger of being complacent.  If the 
instructor does his job, and the student does his job, and I do my job, then our community 
can only get better.<P>
