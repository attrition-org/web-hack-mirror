This month, I would like to focus on another specialized missions for the helicopter, 
firefighting operations.  Most of us have seen news footage or watched movies depicting 
how fixed-wings operate on a fire,  but little is seen on the helicopter.  The helicopter can 
be used for several types of missions.  They can be used for reconnaissance, transporting 
firefighters and their equipment, sling loading equipment to a remote sight, and water 
bucket or fire retardent operations.<p>

I know both Canada and the US use helicopters extensively during firefighting operations.  
Unfortunately I know little of Canada's practices on running firefighting other than all 
helicopters must be capable of responding to a fire emergency.  In the US, different 
agencies are responsible for their territory.  Some fires are fought by the US Forest 
Service, others by the respective State agencies.  If the fire is in a city, then the city fire 
department manages the fire.   So, it all depends on how the territory is divided, as to who 
is responsible for the suppression.  And then of course, if the fire gets big enough, other 
agencies are asked to assist in the battle.  This then becomes a "multi-agency" fire.  For 
this reason, much of the methods and terminology used in fighting fires is "standardized".   
When you get large organizations conducting operations, small differences are a big thing.  
With everyone using the same methods, communication, safety and efficiency are 
enhanced.<p>

<h3>ORGANIZATION</h3><p>

A firefighting attack organization is set up like a military organization.  They are indeed 
fighting an enemy.  This enemy at times can be unpredictable, sneak through lines, or 
advance rapidly with very little to slow it's approach.  Through an organized attack plan, 
firefighting agencies are able to ultimately conquer their adversary.  <p>

Air Attack operations are key to any large scale fire.  The air attack consists of both fixed 
and rotary wing.    The individual in charge of the air attack is called the air attack 
supervisor.  This person is responsible for establishing a strategy for the air operations.  
The strategy may include aircraft priorities on the attack and how all the aircraft will 
operate in the area.  The goal is to provide constant aerial fire suppression.  <p>

Next in line is the air tanker coordinator.  This individual is usually the lead plane during 
air attack operations.  They identify the target and establish approach and departure paths 
to the target.  <p>

Last in the hierarchy of managers is the Helicopter Coordinator.  This person coordinates 
the helicopter missions as well as sets up the helibase.  Establishing the helibase operations 
includes establishing traffic patterns, approach and departure paths, refueling procedures, 
parking areas, foot traffic procedures, and dust control.   <p>


<h3>MISSIONS</h3><p>

A large fire can get very crowded with all types of aircraft.  Tankers of all varieties flying 
through the airspace to deliver their retardent.  Smaller fixed wings providing aerial 
reconnaissance as well as aircraft sequencing.  Helicopters from Jet Rangers to Chinooks 
performing a wide variety of missions.  It really is a battle zone.<p>

The helicopter itself, can be used on several different types of missions while fighting fires.  
They can be used for reconnaissance, water or retardent delivery, and crew and equipment 
movement.<p>

	<dd><u><b>Recon and Coordination</b></u> -  The Helicopter Coordinator 
flies a helicopter to not only ensure helicopter sequencing and coordination but also (as 
with every other aircraft out there) they assist with spotting new fires or giving reports on 
how well the strategy is working.  He can direct minor adjustments to the strategy for 
initial attack on a new area.  <p>

	<dd><u><b>Water or Retardent Delivery</b></u> -  Initial attack is the 
current philosophy on the use of helicopters on a fire.  This is because helicopters can 
react rapidly to an area and begin fighting right away.  <p>

The water bucket, slung below the helicopter is easily deployable and can get water from 
virtually any remote area.  One consideration the pilot might have while flying with the 
bucket is power availability.  This is especially true at higher altitudes.  In addition, the 
weight and balance of the aircraft will change every time the load is added or released.  
Some buckets dump all their water at once, while with others the pilot is able to control 
how much water is released. <p>

An alternative to the bucket is a tank attached to the aircraft.  I don't know much about 
this system other than some helicopter manufactures are conducting research in providing 
attachable tanks to sell to the Fire departments or the National Guard.<p>

	<dd><u><b>Crew and Equipment Placement</b></u> - It can be very 
important to get firefighters and their equipment to and from remote areas.  Some of the 
wilderness areas where fires are fought, do not have easy access.  The helicopter is 
uniquely suited for this task.  They can quickly insert crews based on the fire fighting 
strategy.  They can also extract crews quickly if things aren't going so well.   <p>

<h3>SAFETY</h3><p>

Fighting fires is a dangerous business.  Risk must be minimized through careful planning 
and training.  Communications are a key factor in safety.  With all the air traffic in and 
around a fire, everyone needs to monitor the correct frequency.  If the aircraft is not 
equipped to transmit and receive on the appropriate frequencies, then you should not be 
near the fire.  The chances for a midair dramatically increase without proper 
communication.<p>

Another hazard near and dear to the helicopter pilot is wires.  The altitudes that the 
helicopter pilot operates at, leaves him particularly vulnerable to this hazard.  A thorough 
recon of the area is highly recommended prior to operating in the area.<p>

Where there's fire, there's smoke.  Smoke always seems to be thickest where you want to 
go.  This area of reduced visibility can make it difficult to estimate distance as well as 
cause some visual illusions.  One rule of thumb about smoke is that if you can't see 
through it, don't go there.  Smoke inhalation isn't as much of a problem since we can easily 
depart the smoke filled area.  However this does not mean that this won't happen either.  
<p>

As I stated earlier, power requirements can be very important to monitor.  Remember to 
always plan an escape route while dropping water or making an approach.  If you commit 
yourself without options, you are risking lives.  Winds can aggravate this problem.  
Always plan on having enough power to pull away from an approach with your load just 
in case there is a malfunction and the water or retardent does not release.  <p>

Speaking of <u>releasing your load</u>, watch where the load is dropped.  Firefighters 
on the ground are hot, but a thousand gallons of water is not the answer.  Water 
sometimes isn't the only think in that bucket.  Often rocks or other debris are included.<p>

One thing the helicopter does very well is create a wind.  This <u>downwash</u> is just 
what a fire wants.  It is not good to have the ground crew cursing your name because you 
made the fire worse.  Downwash can also be a hazard while landing to or hovering over a 
burnt out area.  This can cause a brown out condition where the pilot loses all reference to 
the outside world.<p>

And finally, be aware of your own limitations.  <u>Pilot fatigue</u> causes inattention.  
Don't over extend yourself just to make a buck.  That extra hundred dollars isn't' worth a 
life or the cost of a new aircraft.  <p>

<h3>WEATHER</h3><p>

Weather can help or hurt the firefighting efforts.  Mostly we notice when it hurts.  The 
very conditions that caused the fire to start, now keep it going.  Fires can also create their 
own weather pattern.  A large fire can create its own winds thereby dramatically affecting 
planning.<p>

<h3>FOR MORE INFO...</h3><p>

California seems to have more than its share of fires.  (There are those who say they don't 
get enough.)  Matter of fact "fire" is one of the four seasons there.  Because of this, there 
is a great deal of expertise being utilized by LA County, California Department of Forestry 
(CDF) and the US Forest Service (USFS).  There are others, but I mention these folks 
because they use helicopters frequently while fighting fires.  CDF is currently updating 
their water bucket video to help pilots train for the fire season.  <p>

<p>

Once again, I just barely scratched the surface of all you need to know about fighting fires 
with helicopters.  I hope I gave you some insight as to what it is all about.  Please respect 
people hard at work and give firefighters a wide berth.<P>
