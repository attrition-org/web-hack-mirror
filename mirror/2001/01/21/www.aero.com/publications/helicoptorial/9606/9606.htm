<em>This article is dedicated to those determined crews that help 
save lives.  These life-savers come in many varieties.  There are Air 
Ambulance services, Law Enforcement, National Guard, Active Military, 
plus a plethora of civil operators who happen to be in the right place at 
the right time.  And of course lets not forget about those firefighters, 
whether it's in LA county or USFS.  The great job that these people do is 
sometimes overlooked.  If your life is ever saved by these crews, please 
send them a thank-you card or take them to lunch or something.  Yes, they 
get paid for their job, but money isn't the only reason they do what they 
do. The maneuvers these life-saving professionals perform are sometimes 
more risky than what the people they save were doing.</em><P>

Helicopters have that unique ability to easily get to remote areas.  Whether it's at 20,000 
feet on the side of a mountain or over the ocean, helicopters are there.  We rescue people 
in river canyons, on mountain tops, on mountain sides, on roof tops,  traffic accidents, or 
just about anywhere that people can get themselves into trouble.  And it isn't just people 
that are rescued by helicopter.  Animals also get the thrill of flying through the air on 
helicopters, although sometimes they're hanging well below...<P>

The following are some of the types of helicopter operators that perform most of the 
rescues in the US.  I tried to stay with generalities when describing them because each 
works a little different.  If any of you would like to describe a specific operation in detail, 
please e-mail me and we'll post it (giving you credit of course).<p>

<b>AIR AMBULANCE </b><P>

Air Ambulance services are becoming more widespread as helicopters become more 
affordable.   They are growing in cities and rural areas.  There are several services that 
provide excellent service.  It would take me two pages to list all the carriers in the US, so 
I won't.  Air Ambulance services are simply ambulances with rotor blades.  They come 
equipped with medics or nurses to provide immediate first aid to victims.  Some are based 
out of hospitals and others out of airports.  These guys always know the nearest hospital 
since almost all have helicopter landing pads.<P>

As a pilot for these services, you had better know your IFR procedures well because they 
often fly in some of the worst weather.  (Often single pilot, too.)  Having an ATP or CFI 
is very common for these pilots.<P>

<b>LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><P>

Just about all law enforcement agencies seem to have helicopters nowadays.  They use 
them mostly for surveillance but they are also used for quick reaction rescues.  (A future 
article details an interview with the San Jose Police Department on their NOTAR.)  The 
types of aircraft used vary tremendously throughout the country - anywhere from a 
Switzer 300 to Bell Jet Rangers and more.  A lot of agencies even picked up excess 
aircraft from the military.  (The Army provides law enforcement agencies access to their 
UH-1's and OH-58's.)<P>

Pilots for these agencies usually need to be part of the agency first and then apply for their 
helicopter program.  This ensures that the guy or gal in the air has a good understanding 
of what's happening on the ground.  <P>

<b>NATIONAL GUARD</b><P>

The National Guard has two parts - Air National Guard and Army National Guard.  Both 
use helicopters for rescue.  The National Guard is part of the US military and is supplied 
with military equipment.  The Army Guard primarily uses UH-1's and UH-60's for search 
and rescues while the Air Guard has HH-60's and H-3's.  These helicopters usually come 
equipped with hoists so the can rescue folks in extremely remote areas.  A hoist is a cable 
that can be lowered from the aircraft, usually no more than 250 feet, to insert a medic and 
then extract the victim and medic.  Hoists are very handy over water, in tree covered 
areas, mountain sides, or generally anywhere that the helicopter can not land close by.<P>

Since the National Guard is part of the military, the pilots and crew  are trained by the 
military.  I say crew, because these aircraft go out with two pilots and at least one 
crewchief and medic.  Some of the crews have spent time on active duty and others have 
only been in the National Guard.   From what I've seen, for the most part, these are very 
professional crews that are good at what they do.  They average probably about 3,000 
hours and come from all walks of life.  They are engineers, firemen, nurses, doctors, car 
salesmen, insurance salesmen, pilots for other companies or agencies, police, and more.  
When there's a rescue underway, they drop what they are doing on their full time job and  
get to work helping people.  <P>

<b>ACTIVE MILITARY</b><P>

Coast Guard, Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines each have helicopters designated for 
rescue.  Except for the Coast Guard, they are primarily assigned to rescue individuals from 
their respective services, however there are areas where they work closely with the local 
civilians.  <P>

Pilots here attend the military flight training which can be up to a year long.  Because of 
money issues, these pilots usually don't collect as much flight time as the civilians or their 
National Guard counterparts.  They do however focus heavily on training to make best use 
of the available time.  This focus on training makes the outcome of the actual execution of 
a task much more reliable.  <P>

<b>IN CONCLUSION...</b><P>

The helicopter has revolutionized rescue.  Where it used to take days to hike out of a 
remote area, it now takes minutes to fly out.  With hoist and rappelling capability, the 
helicopter doesn't even have to land.  We can thank the US Military for funding the 
development of new technologies which make all this possible.  Ingenuity driven by 
capitalism helped bring this stuff to you and me.  (I had better be careful or I'll be singing 
the National Anthem next!)    <P>

Until Next time...<P>
