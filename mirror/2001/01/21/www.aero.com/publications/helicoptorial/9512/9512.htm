Flying in cold weather presents some unique challenges. (And you thought this article was 
going to be about Christmas.) Especially for those who are not accustomed to freezing 
temperatures. Many people think all they must worry about is ice accumulation. This is not 
the case. Low temperatures also place stress on aircraft components, decrease the 
effectiveness of oils, and increase the stress on your body.<p> 

<B>ICE ISN'T NICE</B><p> 

As I stated earlier ice is not the only problem, but it is a big problem. Just as in fixed wing 
flying, ice accumulation may change the airfoil shape and increase drag. There is also 
parasitic drag from some of the static build up of ice. Most helicopters come equipped with 
engine de-ice but usually only larger helicopters have blade de-ice.<p> 

So what's the difference between de-ice and anti-ice, Chuck?<p> 

Glad you asked. As the name implies de-ice is for the removal of ice and anti-ice is for the 
prevention of ice build up. (I consider pitot heat an anti-ice measure.) De-ice and anti-ice 
can be electrical or bleed air from the engine. This depends on who the manufacturer is and 
what component we're talking about.<p> 

<B>PREFLIGHT</B><p> 

De-icing should start with the preflight. Never scrape or chip away ice from your aircraft. 
The act of chipping may damage the component that you are removing ice from.<p> 

Aircraft components are also stressed in cold weather. This means a thorough preflight 
prior to run-up. If possible, preflight in a hangar is preferred. But if that is not possible, get 
dressed as warm as you can so you don't rush the inspection. I highly recommend wearing 
gloves so your skin doesn't stick to any ice formed on the aircraft. Remember, water, the 
mother of all life, can mean death in cold weather. Small moisture droplets can get almost 
everywhere to foul or clog your system. (Insert your own war story)<p> 

<B>RUN-UP</B><p> 

Run-up is also much longer than normal. Have you ever noticed that your car transmission 
is more sluggish in cold weather? Well the same holds true for the aircraft. Oil pressures 
are high until the oil temperature gets to a "normal" operating range. In cold weather this 
doesn't just happen. It can take a very long time. Some aircraft operations call for the pilot 
to work the flight controls extensively prior to start. This is to get the hydraulics warmed 
and to make sure everything works.<p> 

<B>TAXI</B><p> 

Now that you're ready to taxi be very cautious when coming to a hover. Your aircraft 
might still be stuck to the ground / ice. Did we ever talk about Dynamic Rollover? This 
might be the place for it. A slight back and forth pressure on the pedals will help you break 
free. Remember to be very slow as you apply power.<p> 

<B>FLIGHT</B><p> 

The first thing a pilot might notice when ice is accumulating in flight (besides looking out 
the windshield) is an increased power demand. The rotor is becoming less efficient, so 
hopefully the prudent pilot already has his de-ice and anti-ice on. (Of course the really 
prudent pilot is sitting at home on his couch, throwin' down a beer.) Something else that I 
would hope a pilot would notice is a good vibration as the blade slings the ice. If it gets to 
this point, in my opinion, the pilot has let it go to far. Time to do something. You really 
have two options. Climb or descend. Get out of the conditions that are reeking havoc on 
you and your helicopter. Remember, ATC is your friend. Ask them for assistance.<p> 

<B>STRESSED FOR SUCCESS</B><p> 

Cold weather also stresses the body. I know I sure move slower in the cold. Or maybe it's 
because I'm getting old. People who have had a cold injury in the past are now more 
susceptible to cold injuries. I personally have a standard that if it's cold where I'm flying 
and the heater is inop, then the aircraft is grounded. This is because I know that I'm an 
integral part of the operations of that helicopter and if I don't work properly, then the 
aircraft can't work properly.<p> 

I know many people who fly with jackets on as well. This is nothing to be sneered at. In 
the event that they must leave the aircraft in a hurry, they won't have time to look around 
and dig out their cold weather gear. This is especially true of the folks that operate in 
remote areas.<p> 

<B>CAN HELICOPTERS FLY AT THE NORTH POLE?</B><p> 

So the answer to the question is: Yes, helicopters can fly at the north pole. It just takes a lot 
of good common sense and planning. Speaking of planning. . .What about that magnetic 
compass up there? Are all directions really south? I'll save that for another article.<p>
