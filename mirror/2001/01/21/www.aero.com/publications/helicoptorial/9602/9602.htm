<p>
One of the unique things about helicopters is its ability to pick up and place loads into 
remote areas.  This article will discuss external load operations using a helicopter.  The  
pilots of these types of operations concern themselves with specific questions when 
performing external load operations.  They want to know the type of load, the drag that it 
will create, the weight, the conditions for pick up and set down, how tall are the obstacles 
in the immediate area, what the distance is between pick up and set down and how many 
people are involved.<p>

LOAD IT UP<p>

Dream it up and, if it's not too heavy, the helicopter can lift it.  (Even a CH47D can get 
overloaded.)  Loads can come in all sizes and shapes.  Logs, air conditioners, towers, 
vehicles, and more.  They can even be live cargo.  (I've done some sling loading of mules 
myself.)  Firefighters use water buckets hanging from helicopters to perform initial attack 
missions.  Whatever type of load you are hauling, rigging and weight of the loads are very 
critical.  <p>

Some of us have felt that sick feeling when the load, for whatever reason, departs the 
aircraft unexpectedly.  This could happen if the load was not rigged correctly.  Remember 
the type of sling or clevis must be able to handle a far greater weight than the actual load.  
This is because the G forces on a load, increase its relative weight.  An increase in G force 
can happen during climbs or turns.  I hate to think of live cargo accidentally dropped.  So 
prior to every load, ensure that a qualified individual reviews the load arrangement.   <p>

The weight of the load is also very important.  Remember back from our aerodynamics, 
that a helicopter has to work harder to hover out of ground effect.  Well (news flash) most 
external load operations are outside ground effect.  Careful computation of performance 
data  and weight and balance information prior to picking up a load is essential.  
Complacency from aircrews who <b>thought</b> they had performance without 
computing the data, has wound up wrecking an aircraft.  Too much weight and the pilot 
could lose anti-torque capability, or worse droop the rotor. Losing rotor RPM is BAD.  
<p>

WHAT A DRAG<p>

The pilot must also be concerned with the drag that the load will create.  A large flat load 
flies differently than a round load.  Some loads can even have aerodynamic properties that 
can make them very unstable.  This could be one cause of an oscillation.  Once the load 
begins to oscillate, the pilot must try to stabilize the load.  If the load is oscillating due to 
aerodynamic properties it is probably best for the pilot to slow down.  (More on 
oscillations later.)  For some loads, it is advisable to use a drag chute to help streamline 
the load to keep it from spinning.  I've used a drag chute when slinging another helicopter 
and also when slinging the mule.  <p>

The drag profile will have an effect on the airspeed of the aircraft as well as power used.  
The more drag, the more power required.  As you approach the maximum power 
available, the pilot has fewer options with regard to maneuverability.  It's always best to 
conserve power.  <p>

 
CONDITIONS<p>

Hot, dusty conditions are probably the worst.  Because not only does the higher 
temperature limit you on power but the downwash from the rotor makes it extremely 
difficult to maintain a visual reference point.  Hill tops or roof tops can also pose a 
problem because of the lack of visual reference points to help maintain your position over 
the load.  At times like these it is a great benefit to have another crewmember on the 
aircraft providing guidance to the pilot for drift or altitude.  In short anything that reduces 
your visual cues makes life more difficult.  That's when good pilot technique helps.<p>

OBSTACLES<p>

Wires, buildings, towers, ridge lines heck just about everything can be an obstacle when 
there's a load hanging 100 feet or more below your aircraft.  We must be ever vigilant to 
maintain awareness of where the load is above the ground.<p>

OSCILLATIONS<p>

I've found that the longer the line used, the easier it is for a pilot to experience an 
oscillation in the load.  An oscillation is bad two big reasons:  <p>
<ol>
	<li>  Because controlling the load for placement can be extremely difficult.   
	<li>  A heavy load will feed back the oscillation to the helicopter making it difficult 
to control.   
</ol>
 
When experiencing an oscillation, the pilot has a few options; turn or increase power.  
(Sometimes doing both can help.)  These actions will help stabilize the load.  When the 
oscillation has stopped or decreased, the pilot should ensure that all control movements 
are smooth and positive.  The pilot should always plan each movement of the controls so 
that they lead the load sufficiently so transitioning from one heading to another is gradual.  
Also changing airspeeds should be gradual.  <p>

DON'T GIVE ANY STATIC<p>

A load will build up static electricity as it is flown off the ground to the next location.  
Keep people away from the load until it has been grounded.  A grounding rod may be used 
or touch the load to the ground.  The electric charge is enough to knock someone to the 
ground.  <p>

IN SHORT...<p>

There are three things to consider when doing sling loads; planning, planning, and 
planning.  Know your power requirements.  Know your limitations.  Be smooth and 
positive and the controls.  And always keep in mind the <b>last</b> resort; release the 
load.  If an emergency occurs where the load is aggravating the situation,  open the cargo 
hook.  I don't advocate this unless it's to save the aircraft and its occupants.  Experience 
and common sense under pressure are what is needed in these situations.  If possible, set 
the load down first, then land the aircraft.<p>

There are a million other things that I didn't go over when conducting external load 
operations.  Next month I would like to go over a single mission step-by-step so everyone 
can get a little taste of moving a load.<p>
