Subject: Windmill Brake State<p>

Hi David..Thanks for writing.  <p>

The Windmill Brake State happens when the rotor begins acting like a
windmill.  You'll see this happen if the rotor begins to overspeed during
descents.  Of course the obvious method used to counteract this effect is
to increase collective.<p>

Thanks again for your interest.  If you would like to discuss it in more
detail let me know.  That's a good idea about another article.  I'll probably
do that in a few months.<p>

Take Care<br>
Chuck<p>


...Thanks, that makes sense.  I hadn't heard the term.  - Cheers, Dave.<p>

You should talk to Dick Smith of the Australian Geographic.  Dick not 
only flew his Jet Ranger to the North Pole (literally) but he also flew it 
around the world east to west.(or was that west to east)
At any rate I have flown in many icy conditions on the DEW line in 
Canada's arctic.  The biggest concern of mine when it comes to icing is the 
effect on a rotor systems ability to autorotate.  With the build up of ice on
the blades, which usually starts at the blade root,  their ability to 
produce the driving force for autorotation is rapidly deminished because 
of the change of the airfoil shape.  With not too much ice you may as well 
be riding a manhole cover if the stove quits!<p>

Way to go, Chuck!  It's good to see some real helicopter interest on the net.<p>

I'm the Chief R&D Test pilot for Sikorsky, and really like to see helo stuff on the net.<p>

Please keep in touch with us down here at West Plam Beach, FL, where 
we're flying the Comanche.  I'd enjoy working a question and answer 
slot for your page, if anyone's interested.<p>

...Another great source of info!  We're contacting Nick and will take him up on his 
offer.<br>
