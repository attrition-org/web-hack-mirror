	<font size=5>T</font>he subject of helicopter aerodynamics has come up in 
recent conversations with readers.  I don't claim to be an aeronautical engineer, so I'll try 
to keep this basic enough so I can understand what I'm talking about.  I will also break this 
topic up into <u>at least</u> two parts.  In Part 1, I will discuss the basics: Laws, 
principles, aircraft component characteristics.  In Part 2, I will discuss flight from a hover 
to VNE.  Please feel free write to me about your difference of opinion, if I stated 
something incorrectly or if you have a different experience.  One pilot wrote to me last 
month and asked if I was going to discuss tandem rotors.  I screamed to myself, pulled a 
few hairs out, and decided that I would have to do some research.<p>

<b>IT'S THE LAW</b><br>
Principles and laws relating to flying.<p>
</center>
	The concepts that are really important in helicopter flying are Bernoulli's principle,  
Newton's three laws of motion, and gyroscopic precession or phase lag.  <p>

<b>Bernoulli and Lift</b><p>

Most aviators are familiar with Bernoulli.  I sometimes refer to him as my buddy Dan.  
From the principle he developed for fluid dynamics, the lift equation was born.  It seems 
like everyone knows the lift equation and what each of the components represent.  
However for a quick refresher I attempted to clarify things below.  I added an additional 
box to indicate whether each element may be changed or manipulated during flight.<p>

<p>
The pilot has control over two parts of this equation: the C<font size=1>L</font> and the velocity.  
Interestingly, the design of the rotor system allows for automatic adjustments in the same 
two portions of the equation.  For instance, the coefficient of lift may be changed by the 
pilot with the manipulation of the collective or cyclic or it may be changed by an induced 
flow of air into the rotor system, which changes the resultant relative wind.  Velocity may 
be changed by the pilot when he/she (politically correct) changes airspeed or rotor RPM 
or velocity may be changed slightly with shift in center of gravity when a blade flaps. More 
on flapping later.<p>

<b>Newton</b><p>

Newton's three laws of motion that helicopter pilots will respond to are: inertia, 
acceleration, and action-reaction.  <p>

<b>Gyroscopic Precession</b><p>

Now that I've totally confused everyone let me add the final concept: Gyroscopic 
Precession and phase lag.  Rotating bodies have an interesting characteristic.  Any force 
applied to a rotating body takes affect 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation.  (Check 
it out for yourself with a spinning top.)  So with a helicopter, if we want to change the lift 
vector on the left side of the rotor disk, in a helicopter with the rotor turning 
counterclockwise, a force is applied on the aft portion of the rotating disk.   Cool huh?
<p>

<b>COMPONENT CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>
Main and Tail Rotors<p>
</center>
<b>Flapping</b><p>

Flapping is the up and down movement of the rotor blade at the hinge or, for semi-rigid 
systems, about the trunion bearing (at the mast).  Flapping occurs in a blade due to 
velocity.    On a no-wind day flapping is equal across the disk.  But add just 1 knot of 
wind and you get unequal lift across the rotor disk.  When wind or directional flight is 
present, the rotor disk has an advancing and retreating side relative to the airflow.  So the 
advancing blade has greater lift than the retreating blade.  This isn't necessarily a good 
thing if I want to maintain straight and level flight.  Remember velocity has a dramatic 
affect on the lift equation.  Picture the lift equation on both sides of the mast.  
<p><center>
C<font size=1>L</font> S V&#178; r / 2 = <b>L</b> = r V&#178; S C<font size=1>L</font> / 2<p>
</center>
On one side velocity has increased.  On the other side velocity has decreased.  This is not a 
balanced equation!! This is a condition call <b>Dissymmetry of Lift</b>.  Other 
components of the equation must be adjusted to attain balance.  We have already 
established that neither aircraft nor the pilot can not affect "S" or "r",  So the only thing 
left to adjust is the C<font size=1>L</font>.  With the increased velocity the advancing blade will climb.  As it 
climbs, the angle of attack is reduced by the change in relative wind.  With the blade 
flapping up a new airflow is introduced to assist induced flow.  This flow is a downward 
flow of air which has the result of decreasing the angle of attack.  Just the opposite 
happens on the retreating blade so that the retreating blade has a greater angle of 
attack.<p>

<b>Feathering</b><p>

Feathering is just a term used to describe the rotation of the blade along its axis.  The 
rotation changes the angle of attack of the airfoil.<p>

<b>Hunting</b><p>

Also known as Lead and Lag, it is the fore and aft movement of the blade as it rotates.  As 
a blade flaps up, its center of gravity shifts towards the axis of rotation.  As any fan of the 
French mathematician Coriolis will tell you, this causes an increase in RPM.  Coriolis 
called this the law of conservation of angular momentum.  So the advancing blade leads 
because the up flap of the blade makes it move faster; and the retreating blade lags 
because the down flap of the blade shifts the cg outward slowing down the rotation.  I 
might add that in the semi-rigid underslung rotor, hunting is discouraged.  The design of 
the pivot point inhibits the shift in cg of the blade as it flaps.<p>




<b>Coning</b><p>

The blades or rotor disk cones for two basic reasons.  The blade tip is faster than the blade 
root.  Remembering the characteristics of our friend velocity, this causes an increased lift 
at the tip of the blade.  Coning is the result.  In today's aircraft, engineers have taken 
advantage of this knowledge to minimize coning.  Using the strength and flexibility of 
modern materials, they have designed blades with a twist <em>and</em> that have the 
camber of the airfoil change along the span of the blade.  But, as you add weight to the 
center of rotation, the disk will also cone.<p>

<b>Torque</b><p>

Because of  Newton's third law of motion - <b>Action-Reaction</b>, we get an effect 
called torque.  Because there is a force driving the main rotor, there is an equal and 
opposite reaction at the fuselage.  So as the main rotor is driven in a counterclockwise 
direction, the fuselage reacts in a clockwise direction.  This is fun if you're on a carnival 
ride but not if you are trying to fly somewhere safely.  Most helicopters solve this problem 
with a tail rotor.  The pilot can manipulate the "lift" in the tail rotor so as to counter act 
torque.  Tandem helicopters solve the problem with two rotor disks which turn opposite 
of each other.  And now of course there's the NOTAR which uses air flow.<p>

Next month, I hope to put this all together to describe the things that happen along the 
way from point A to point B.  From in-ground effect to out-of-ground effect and from 
zero airspeed to retreating blade stall.  Until next time - <em>Chuck</em>
