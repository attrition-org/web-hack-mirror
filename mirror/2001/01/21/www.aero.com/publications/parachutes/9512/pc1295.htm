<center><h1>Leaping From Tall Buildings:<br>
A Rescue Option - and More!</h1>
<h3>by Jim Bates</h3>

<p>
 
<dl>
<dd>For centuries thought has been given to saving lives of people living or 
working in human-made structures. Fires can drive desperate people trapped in 
skyscrapers - or airplanes - to certain death as they escape searing flames. One fire 
survivor who bailed out of a fiery F6F U.S. Navy fighter plane said, "I would have 
jumped from that plane even if I didn't have a parachute. You can't imagine such 
pain! I would not have let myself die that way! "
</dl><p>

<dd>At an early time in the development of humans the conventional existing and living 
environment was on the ground - solid earth on which one walked or ran or sat or slept. 
Then 
some humans quickly became cave dwellers when they wanted protection from wild, 
savage 
animals and belligerent fellow humans.<br>

<dd>Then humans learned how to make structures, solid constructions that rose higher 
and 
higher above the ground. Communities of multilevel residential dwellings were formed, 
steadily 
becoming taller. Merchants' offices were developed and communities became trade 
centers, 
towns, 
and cities. Building heights continued growing.<br>
<dd>The renowned, prolific Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) understood the inherent 
peril 
of 
humans rising above the earth's surface. And his thinking process about such "rising" was 
not 
limited only to majestic, soaring, bird-like flight.<br>

<dd>He also had the notion that some way was needed for a person to safely leave tall 
buildings in time of emergency. His mind stirred with ideas, looking for an answer to the 
dilemma 
facing persons in dire need of some means of escape. However, there was nowhere to go 
to get 
background, to learn what others were doing. Rich research resources such as huge 
libraries and 
national archives and computer databases that are at hand in the 2Oth century did not 
exist 
in da 
Vinci's time. His solution was to do a lot of thinking.<br>
<dd>With building fires claiming lives - some by burning and suffocation, others who 
jumped rather than face unendurable flames - his constantly churning mind turned to 
planning 
some device useful to those trapped at perilous heights in fiery buildings. His 1485 
sketchbook 
showed a not-at-all-outlandish idea:<p>

<center><img src="images/davinci3.gif"></center><p>


<dd>The great da Vinci's idea apparently never got further. No record has ever been 
found 
of such 
a device actually having been constructed, even in model form of any scale. Beyond the 
sketch and 
brief notes, da Vinci's idea remained just that - an <em>idea</em> .<br>
<dd>However, through the centuries, as buildings grew taller and as fires sporadically 
caused 
people to burn and suffocate to death and to die by leaping from them rather than face 
the 
agonies of 
burning, other thinkers now and then continued to dream up contrivances so people could 
rescue 
themselves in that predicament.<br>
<dd>There also developed yet another consideration for self-rescue. Skeletal frameworks 
reached 
ever higher in the quest for mightier structures; buildings that would serve as "high rise" 
apartment 
dwellings in which people could live relatively close to where they worked. Other 
buildings 
also 
quickly proliferated - layer on layer of business offices and commercial centers where 
firms could 
be close to one another, could be close to population resources serving as labor pools for 
their 
businesses.<br>
<dd>Steel skeletons rose higher. Intrepid workers - steeplejacks - clambered up and 
down and 
across girders, bolting temporarily here, riveting permanently there, steadily fastening 
parts 
together. Sometimes workers fell and most of them died; some from injuries, though 
perhaps only 
falling a short distance. Others died instantly on impact, after experiencing the terror of 
the 
fall, the 
terror of knowing what was about to happen. Many of them knew long such 
moments.<p>

				<center>* * *</center><p>

<dd>Shortly after the turn of our century, Lee Miller, of Chicago, Illinois, spent a lot of 
time 
pondering a notion for "a new and useful Parachute Device, ... " Finally, on December 7, 
1911, he 
filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office in Washington, D.C. His basic premise 
when he 
first started doing his thinking was that the "device" would be used by an aviator, but 
along 
the way 
to filing his application he had additional thoughts and on September 10, 1912, the 
granted 
patent 
said:<p>

<dd>"The invention relates to aerial life saving devices of the parachute type, and has for 
its object 
the provision of a device which can be worn as part of the clothing of aviators operating 
aeroplanes, 
balloons, and the like, or those engaged as steeplejacks at lofty elevations, and subject to 
danger 
from falling.<br>
<dd>A further object of the invention is to provide in connection with the parachute, for 
the 
automatic and rapid expansion of the same regardless of the position assumed by the 
wearer in his 
fall.<br>
<dd>Another object of the invention is the combination, in such a device of a man, of the 
necessary 
elements to effect its automatic operation in such a manner as to entail the least burden 
because of 
the weight and the least interference with the movements of the person so equipped."<p>

<A HREF="miller4.htm"><img src="images/miller3.gif"><br>Patent Images, Lee 
Miller</a></center><p>

<dd>Miller, in the specification of "Patent Number 1,037,959, Parachute Device," 
referred 
to the 
canopy as a "parachute body," describing that component of the assembly as:<p>
<dl>
<dd>"the segment of a sphere and has a diameter of about fifteen feet with a depth of 
three 
to five 
feet. The body is provided at the top with an opening of sufficient size to allow a slight 
escape of air 
there through to prevent oscillation, and it is also provided with circumferential and 
radial 
reinforcing cords.... "</dl><p>

The specification further noted:<p>
<dl>
<dd>"The parachute thus far described is of the usual construction except that it is 
necessary in 
order to adapt it for use in this connection to make the same of a special quality of silk, 
which shall 
have the least weight consistent with the required strength. I have found it advantageous 
to 
use a 
silk weighing about 2.6 ounces to the square yard and have resistance to rupture of about 
thirty-two 
pounds per inch. Material of this sort in a parachute having a diameter of fifteen feet, as 
stated, 
weighs about three and one half pounds complete."<p></dl>

<dd>Complying with the U.S. Patent Office requirement that an inventor bolster a patent 
application with one or more claims for the item being submitted for federal approval of 
singularity, 
Miller made nine such claims as to why his design was different from any other. <br>
<dd>Summarizing the formal wording of the claims, features of his invention 
included:<p>
<ul>
<li> A foldable parachute, with suspension lines and attaching ring.<br>
<li> User's harness attached to suspension lines.<br>
<li> An inflater (air duct with expansible walls and discharging into the folded 
parachute).<br>
<li> A detachable case for the collapsed inflater.<br>
<li> Rigid and flexible members extending from the harness to support the folded 
parachute above 
a user's head.<br>
<li> Pads and yoke.<br>
<li> A hood enveloping a user's head and extending downward over user's 
shoulders.<br>
<li> Adjustable straps.<br>
<li> Pivotally mounted jointed framework.<br>
<li> Elastic stays.
</ul><p>

<dd>The inventor paid particular attention to getting the canopy to inflate as quickly as 
possible. 
For steeplejacks, Miller reasoned, this was the most important consideration. An 
"ironworker" 
would not normally be at a height an aviator would be, a height that would allow greater 
time for 
canopy deployment and inflation; but steeplejacks were routinely working at great 
heights 
when 
Miller cogitated about his parachute. He concentrated on "automatic and rapid 
expansion... 
regardless of the position assumed by the wearer in his fall." Miller devised an "inflater 
of 
flexible 
material" - a duct with an opening attached to a framework at the back of the hood on a 
user's 
head; further devising "membranes" within the duct that separated front and rear channels 
that each 
permitted air flow in only one direction. Miller's patent stated:<p>
<dl>
<dd>"It will be observed that upward currents of air will enter the forward channel of the 
inflater in 
its lower portion and thence traverse the upper channel of the same, the action of the air 
thereon 
tending to press the membrane to the rear and prevent return currents through the rear 
channel, 
whereas downward currents of air will enter the upwardly flaring mouth of the rear 
channel, 
passing to the single channel of the upper portion and tending to press the membrane 
forward so as 
to close the front channel. This provision is intended to meet the conditions present 
during 
a fall, 
directing the relative upward rush of air into and through the inflater whether the wearer 
falls head 
first or feet first."<p>
</dl>

<dd>Miller's patent specification was quite complete, including basic packing 
instructions. 
And he 
carefully included reasoning and calculations, the latter with figures showing why he 
claimed his 
device was sure and safe:<p>
<dl>
<dd>"... The capacity of the inflater is such that the parachute will be fully extended 
within 
the first 
few yards of descent, so that if the elevation is sufficient to cause material injury, the 
parachute will 
expand and break the fall. If the distance is not sufficient to allow the parachute to 
expand, 
the 
arrangement of the same upon the head of the wearer will serve as a cushioning device to 
prevent 
injury from contact with the ground or from parts of the machine striking the head of the 
person.<br>
<dd>"It will be understood that if the man when he starts to fall is in full possession of 
his 
faculties, he need not wait for the automatic release of the hood but may snatch it off 
with 
his 
hand.<br>
<dd>"If, however, he is panic stricken or is affected with mountain sickness causing 
unconsciousness, the duct will work automatically and with certainty. With the inflater 
capacity 
illustrated and found advantageous by test the lateral pressure upon the walls of the 
inflater 
caused 
by the inrushing air currents and acting to release the outer ease rapidly increases with 
the 
descent 
from a pressure of slightly more than a half pound to the square foot at the end of a fall 
of 
five feet; 
three pounds at the end of twenty feet; ten pounds at the end of seventy-five feet, and 
fourteen 
pounds at the end of one hundred feet, from which it will be seen that the disengagement 
of 
the 
friction clamps from the ears [located on each side of the hood] and the consequent 
release 
of the 
hood and expansion of the parachute is certain to follow a fall whatever be the initial 
position of the 
aviator."<p>
</dl>

<dd>Lee Miller's inclusion, besides aviators, of steeplejacks and others being at great 
heights, 
shows that his vision was not limited. However, nothing further has been discovered 
pertaining to 
Lee Miller's concept.<br>
<dd>Aviation grew enormously in Miller's time and thereafter. The World War and the 
discovery 
of air power impelled aviation's growth to gargantuan proportions. While designs of 
aerial 
machines, airships, airplanes, aerial vessels, aeroplanes, aircraft, and flying machines 
proliferated, 
designs of parachutes, by comparison were usually few and far between. The possibility 
of 
falling 
to earth unprotected against injury and death, seemed to seldom occur to plane designers 
and many 
pilots.<br>
<dd>However, European military balloon observers in the Great War, once they 
discovered how 
vulnerable they were to attacking enemy fighter planes, quickly opted for static line 
parachutes that 
let them escape from collapsing envelopes or fiery infernos.<p>

<dd>Miller's patent specifications did not mention adaptability of his life-saving device 
as a 
means 
of escaping buildings on fire. But about the same time Miller was completing his 
planning 
for an 
aerial life-saving device, another inventor thousands of miles away in Europe, was 
immersed in his 
own thinking. One of that inventor's primary considerations was the rescue of victims in 
burning 
structures.<p>

<br clear=all>
<dd>About the time Miller's patent was ultimately approved and published in September 
1912, 
Adolf Odkolek von Augezd, a subject of the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, residing at 
Baden, near 
Vienna, filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office for his own invention, 
saying:<p>

<dd><dd>"I. . . have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Parachutes: . . . 
"<p>

<dd>A year and a half later, on December 9, 1913, von Augezd's patent (parachute; 
#1,081,137), 
making fourteen claims for uniqueness, was granted by America. <br>
<dd>Early in the patent specifications he states:<p>

<dl>
<dd>"My invention relates to parachutes and has for its object a mechanism for 
efficiently 
and 
reliably opening parachutes attached to persons or objects above the ground. As 
experience 
shows 
most of the accidents with parachutes are due to the fact that the parachute does not fully 
open and 
therefore cannot carry the full load or is prevented from properly operating by the object 
itself 
which it is designed to carry. For avoiding these inconveniences and thereby rendering 
parachutes 
perfectly safe in use I provide according to my invention means for shooting the 
parachute 
as a 
whole upward by a driving agent such as an explosive charge or fluid under pressure and 
for 
shooting outward its ribs or periphery by driving agents such as an explosive or fluid 
under 
pressure before the load to be carried by the parachute becomes operative upon the same. 
Thus my 
improved parachute becomes a reliable means for escape by aeronauts, for persons in 
burning 
houses and the like."<p>
</dl>
Herr von Augezd further said:<p>

<dl>
<dd>"The shooting device for the parachute as a whole consists of a tube similar in 
construction to 
the barrel of a firearm and is secured to any desired part of the aeroplane, balloon, 
building, 
or the 
like in a vertical or inclined position...."<p>
</dl>
<a name="fig4"></a>
<center><A HREF="augezd2.htm"><img src="images/augezd1.gif"><br>
Patent Drawing, Herr von Augezd</a>
</center><p>

The inventor's specification went into great detail explaining:<p>
<dl>
<dd>"the operation of the device... when used on an aeroplane or a balloon....In case of 
an 
emergency the pilot pulls the firing cord. . . fires the explosive charge. .. so that the 
folded 
parachute is driven upward. . . takes with it... the device for unfolding the parachute... 
[other] 
explosive charges. .. are fired at the moment when the parachute is so far above the 
aeroplane or 
balloon that it can unfold freely.... The length of the [suspension] cords carrying the load 
is 
so 
determined that it is only after unfolding the parachute that they are fully stretched so 
that 
the load to 
be carried by the parachute is taken up by the same only after it has been properly 
unfolded 
and thus 
is securely supported by the parachute which then descends slowly together with the 
load.... "<p>
</dl>

Inventor von Augezd especially noted:<p>

<dl>
<dd>"The device may also be used as a fire escape in buildings... For this purpose the 
parachute 
may be mounted near a window in such manner that it is shot obliquely upward for 
bringing it out 
of reach of the flames.... The length of the [suspension] cords has to be determined 
according to 
conditions in which the device has to be used. Any construction of parachute may be 
used."<p>
</dl>

<dd>Ideas for people rescuing themselves continued to be announced by inventors from 
time to 
time after Herr von Augezd's U. S .-patented device. But little was, or is yet, done by 
architects or 
builders to incorporate some means of emergency egress from towering infernos. 
Occupants 
generally are left to find a safe means of interior descent. Such escape action is usually 
impossible, 
with power outage eliminating use of elevators, with smoke- and flame-filled corridors 
and 
stairwells blocking passage. Or the frightened occupants have to rely on waiting to 
somehow be 
rescued by fire departments. However, despite buildings of every type rising to 
extraordinary 
heights, rescue vehicles still only have ladders reaching limited elevations.<p>

<dd>(The l988 British-American comedy film "A Fish Called Wanda" illustrates a 
practical 
nonparachute fire escape device made use of by a three-man gang of robbers escaping 
from 
a 
building rooftop after they have robbed a diamond merchant. The robbed firm is on the 
top 
floor of 
a several-story building and the masked thieves quickly dart to the roof, then, one after 
the 
other, 
enter into the mouth of a vertical tube made of strong, mesh material kept open in a 
circular 
shape 
by a series of hoops spaced along the device's vertical length. The "soft" escape tube's 
diameter is 
reduced between the spaced hoops and that constriction is sufficient to prevent a body 
from 
hurtling 
through the tube at dangerous speed, but not so narrow as to prevent passage. The device 
worked 
just fine for the fleeing bandits, each needing only several seconds to move from rooftop 
to 
the 
pavement below, but then no flames were engulfing the device.)<br>
<dd>Helicopters have been useful in plucking helpless victims from rooftops, but not 
every 
building-on-fire occupant has always been successful in reaching the haven of the 
building's roof. 
And it usually requires much precious time to get properly equipped rescue helicopters to 
a 
high-rise disaster.<p>

<dd>With the advent of "fixed object-/B.A.S.E.-parachuting," proof is at hand that 
extremely low-level parachuting can be a reliable means of getting down safely from a 
high 
object on the 
earth's 
surface.<br>
<dd>"B.A.S.E." (or BASE) is an acronym for "Building, Antenna, Span, and Earth." 
This form 
of "sport" parachuting has become popular with some experienced skydivers, despite its 
added 
risks. BASE jumping is not recognized as "legitimate" sport parachuting by the United 
States 
Parachute Association, or by parachuting governing bodies of other nations, because of 
such 
jumping's extraordinary inherent risks (more so, they must feel, than conventional sport 
parachuting / skydiving).<br>
<dd>Such "fixed objects" jumps have been made from varied sites, including:<p>
<ul>
<li> "World Trade Towers" - New York City<br>
<li> "El Capitan"; a 3, 000-foot high rock outcropping with a smooth face-Yosemite 
National 
Park, California<br>
<li> "Sears Tower" - Chicago<br>
<li> A river bridge-Rhode Island<br>
<li> The "Space Needle"-Seattle, Washington<br>
<li> Radio / television antenna towers<br>
<li> "New River Gorge Bridge"-West Virginia<br>
(An annual "bridge jump day" is held at this site where a "legal" fixed object-/BASE-
jump 
can be 
made on only one day a year, in October between the hours of 10 AM and 4 PM, under 
the 
strict 
control of the U.S. National Park Service.)<br>
<li> Building-mounted and mobile cranes at construction sites<br>
<li> A landmark building tower - Montreal, Canada<br>
<li> "Leaning Tower"-Pisa, Italy
</ul><p>

<dd>Though maligned by sport parachuting/skydiving "purists," leaping from fixed 
objects with 
fall-retardation devices has been going on since time immemorial (some reports say in 
ancient 
China, with leaps from its Great Wall using parasols) and has developed into a 
burgeoning 
present-day activity. Parachuting is no longer limited to jumping from planes, 
helicopters, 
and hot-air 
balloons.<br>
<dd>The number of developers and manufacturers of specialized equipment for fixed-
object 
parachuting has grown rapidly. Oversize pilot chutes with "truck stopping power" have 
been 
produced; canopy packing methods have been devised to ensure "clean" deployment and 
speedy, 
positive inflation; canopy/suspension line stowage in a container has been refined; fast-
opening 
containers have been created.<br>
<dd>Buildings continue to be erected that reach high up into the sky, many insistently 
poking to 
mind-boggling heights. And they continue being higher and higher without incorporating 
some 
method of occupant escape in perilous, life-threatening circumstances. However, 
inventors 
have 
kept coming up with notions to remedy that shortcoming (as in the "Wanda" escape 
tube). 
The 
gamut of schemes still includes use of a parachute.<br>
<dd>As an example, in the late 1970s, the U.S. Patent Office issued a patent to a South 
American 
inventor for a parachute escape system for buildings.<p>
<center>
						* * *<p>
</center>

<dd>Use of a parachute to leap from a building can readily be seen as an extreme 
measure. 
But 
persons in life-threatening predicaments are quite willing to resort to such an extreme to 
save 
themselves. Even without any means of self-rescue at hand, many people have 
knowingly 
leaped to 
death rather than face the agony and horror of fire. Paul Berk, retired and living in 
Wethersfield, 
Connecticut, knows the feeling.<br>
<dd>Berk, a test pilot in 1943 for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in East Hartford, 
Connecticut, 
was 
doing specialized performance tests with a U.S. Navy F6F "Wildcat" fighter plane, flying 
high-speed runs at 28,000 feet on a course between the outskirts of Boston, 
Massachusetts 
and 
the 
eastern New York state border town of Brewster. Berk had just completed his first east-
west dash 
and crossed the western Connecticut border, completing his turn at the far side of 
Brewster. 
Something went wrong in the engine compartment as Berk started roaring eastward from 
Brewster. 
Berk and company engineers later speculated that the high-speed compressor failed. Parts 
exploded 
through the engine cowling and oil covered the windshield. Fire fueled by gasoline and 
oil 
started 
immediately, ripping through the firewall into the pilot compartment. Berk's left hand 
clawed 
through the flames, groping for the fuel shut-off control, but the red and yellow and blue 
wall of 
fire started cooking his hand and toasting his arm. The plane's high speed drove air 
mightily 
through the plane, spreading the fire. Flames charred his flying suit and shoes, singed his 
face. In 
agony brought on by his burns, Berk made his decision: "I'm gettin' the hell outta 
here!"<br>
<dd>He jerked back the canopy, undid his shoulder harness and lap belt, snapped the 
Wildcat onto 
its back, and let himself fall from the plane. His oxygen mask was torn from his face in 
the 
exit. He 
yanked the ripcord of his backpack parachute, felt canopy opening shock, then, in 
seconds, 
passed 
out from lack of oxygen at 28,000 feet. Somewhere about 14-15,000 feet, in denser 
atmosphere, 
he recovered consciousness. Minutes later he landed safely under a badly damaged silk 
parachute 
canopy. After recovering from his burns, he was back testing military aircraft, and did so 
until 
retirement in 1972. His love of flying kept him in the air. On weekends he often flew 
student 
parachutists and experienced skydivers at a Connecticut drop zone.<br>
<dd>Berk can still vividly recall those agonizing, unendurable moments. "I would," he 
says, "have 
jumped from that plane even if I didn't have a parachute. You can't imagine such pain! I 
would not 
have let myself die that way!"<p>
