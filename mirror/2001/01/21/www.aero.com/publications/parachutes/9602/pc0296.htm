On January 18, 1996 the Boston Globe, a daily newspaper published in Boston, 
Massachusetts carried a small article with the headline "Jet Stairs Deploy in Flight." A 
Reuters news item with a dateline of San Antonio, Texas gave a brief amount of the 
unusual in-flight incident:<p>

<dl>
<dd>A Trans World Boeing 727 with 72 people aboard landed at San Antonio 
International Airport Tuesday night after the aircraft's rear stairs deployed in flight. TWA 
Flight 199 was flying from St. Louis to San Antonio when a cockpit warning light 
indicated that the stairs under the jet's tail engine had become unlocked, an airline 
spokesman said....<p>

<dd>The pilot descended to 3,000 feet and depressurized the cabin so that the stairs, 
which are behind a bulkhead door in the rear of the aircraft, could be retracted. "A crew 
member reached around, grabbed the handle, and pulled, raising the stairs hydraulically," 
[the spokesman] said. A rope was tied around the handle to keep the stairs raised.... TWA 
policy requires that the rear stairs be lowered when an aircraft is on the ground as a 
safety precaution, and crews use the stairs to gain access.<p>

<dd>The airline is reviewing maintenance operations at St. Louis-Lambert International 
Airport. The jet was back in service yesterday.<p>
</dl>

Another newspaper story appeared the same day in the nationally distributed <em>USA 
Today</em>, but that account had more of the story. Its headline was "Crew Member 
Held by Belts Shuts Airborne Jet's Stairs" and reporter Robert Davis wrote:<p>
<dl>
<dd>A stairwell on a Trans World Airlines dropped in flight, and a crew member 
tethered by seat belts pulled it closed.... The three-member cockpit crew first noticed the 
problem at an altitude of 35,000 feet when a light flashed, warning the stairs under the 
plane's tail were ajar. Crew members peered out a window on the back door leading to 
the stairs and saw the stairs had dropped about two feet. Flight attendants moved 
passengers away. The pilot descended to 3,000 feet and depressurized the cabin so the 
crew could open the door and one could grab a lever for the hydraulic system that 
operates the stairs. The crew member who reached for the lever was tied with seat belts 
so another could hold him. The stairs rose, but didn't latch, so the crew members tied the 
lever in place.... Mechanics in San Antonio serviced the hydraulic system that operates 
the stairs. The plane, operated by TWA since 1969, flew its scheduled route 
Wednesday.<p>

<dd>Federal officials showed little interest because there were no injuries and no 
damage.
Part of TWA's investigation will focus on why a latch designed after the USA's only 
unsolved skyjacking failed to keep the stairs closed.... "There is a lock that is supposed to 
prevent [the door opening]....the stairs sometimes get stuck, requiring service before the 
plane leaves the gate, but [the TWA spokesman] says he doesn't know of another in-
flight problem with the stairs.<p>

<b>Therein Lies a Tale</b><p>

Late in the afternoon of November 24, 1971 an inconspicuous middle-aged man wearing 
a plain suit and dark glasses boarded Flight 305, a three-engine Boeing 727-100 
commercial jet aircraft belonging to Northwest Airlines, home-based in Minnesota. He 
got on board in Portland, Oregon, north bound for the Seattle-Tacoma (known locally as 
SEA-TAC) Airport in Seattle, Washington. Scheduled take-off was 4:35 P.M.<p>

The man's name on the plane's manifest was Dan Cooper. There was also a male 
passenger already on board named Michael Cooper, traveling from Missoula, Montana to 
Seattle. (The press was later credited with identifying the middle-aged man as "D.B. 
Cooper" and that identifier has remained in most accounts since that time.)<p>

<a href="images/fbipostr.gif"><img src="images/fbibuttn.gif" align=left></a>
D.B. Cooper gained sudden notoriety as the perpetrator of the FBI's only major unsolved 
"skyjacking." He became the first and only "successful " parachuting skyjacker in 
American history, successful in that he disappeared with $200,000 in ransom money. His 
deed led to elaborate airport security systems and to redesign of the Boeing 727 jetliner 
so the rear door could not be opened in flight. (Obviously, the redesign was flawed, as 
shown by newspaper reports 24 years later ).<p>

There were 35 other passengers on Flight 305 out of Portland for a 175-mile flight-a 
short hop for a 727 jet. The plane got a late start and finally lifted off the runway at 4:45 
P.M.. When the plane reached cruising altitude, "Dan Cooper," sitting in an aisle seat 
toward the rear of the plane, gave a stewardess a note and quietly said to her, "Read that." 
She was stunned, but she was careful not to let passengers see any reaction. She showed 
the note to another stewardess, who was equally shocked, but who also remained quiet, 
not visibly shaken by what she had read. The first stewardess was reported to have 
delivered an oral amount of the message to the aircraft captain.<p>

Accounts are blurred as to what actually happened to the note itself. One version, given 
much later, by a freelance writer (Richard T. Tosaw, former FBI special agent who 
became a finder of missing heirs) published in <em>Parachutist Magazine</em> (the 
official publication of the United States Parachute Association) reported that the note 
stated: "I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I 
WANT YOU TO SIT BESIDE ME. YOU ARE BEING HIJACKED." A newspaper 
story some time after the event said that the first stewardess who was shown the note was 
also shown the inside of the man's briefcase, in which she saw what she thought was a 
bomb.<p>

However, the actual wording of the note remains a mystery. A book published in 1985 
("D.B. Cooper: What Really Happened" by Max Gunther; Contemporary Books Inc., 
Chicago) cited that the note "was neatly hand-printed in ink. Its precise wording is lost to 
history, for the business-suited man [the hijacker] reclaimed it." The book author (a 
former editor for <em>Business Week</em>, <em>Time</em>, and <em>True</em> 
magazines) went on to write that two stewardesses remembered "its gist with stark 
clarity." Gunther noted, "It said that the man had a bomb in his case. He wanted 
$200,000 in twenty dollar bills and four parachutes to be delivered to him when the plane 
landed in Seattle. If his demands were not satisfied, he intended to blow up the airplane. 
"<p>

Gunther went on to describe what happened when the pilot came back to the middle-aged 
man's seat to see if the matter was a hoax. Moving into a seat next to the skyjacker, who 
had moved over to a window seat, the captain quietly asked: "What's this about a 
bomb?"<p>

"The man opened the case and closed it again quickly. In that brief glimpse, [the captain] 
saw two red cylinders and a jumble of wires. " Persuaded by what he had seen, the 
captain reported to the flight deck and radioed SEA-TAC Airport.<p>

D.B. Cooper ordered that the 727 was to circle SEA-TAC until the money and the four 
parachutes were ready to be delivered to him. Northwest's president was reached at home 
in Minneapolis and made a quick decision: "Do whatever the man demands.':<p>

The hijacker's demands were met when the plane landed in Seattle. Harried airline 
officials and FBI agents had to hustle to acquire what the skyjacker demanded and have it 
ready for him in less than an hour.<p>

The parachute types specified by D.B. Cooper, according to author Gunther, were 
acquired from a sport parachute center in Issaquah, Washington-two standard 
emergency back-type and two chest-type auxiliary parachutes (the latter generally termed 
reserve chutes, for back-up emergency use if the main chute should malfunction when a 
sport parachutist was making a jump). The parachute center in Issaquah provided the two 
chest packs and Earl Cossey, a parachuting instructor at the Issaquah drop zone as well as 
an FAA Master Parachute Rigger, contacted at his nearby home, brought two back-type 
rigs from his parachute workshop there and delivered them to the parachute school. (The 
types and number of parachutes asked for by D.B. Cooper led to early speculation that 
the skyjacker might have freefall parachuting experience and that he might have an 
accomplice.)<p>

The FBI prepared the ten thousand $20 bills that made up the $200,000 demanded. To 
identify the money, all the bills were photographed with a high-speed Recordak machine 
to create a microfilm later to be used to prepare a list of serial numbers.<p>

Everything the skyjacker wanted was ready at the airport when the airport tower radioed 
the plane at 5:24 P.M.. -"We're ready down here.': Flight 305 touched down sixteen 
minutes later, at 5:40.<p>

With money and parachutes on board, all passengers and two of three stewardesses were 
freed. The hijacker ordered the plane to be flown to Mexico. Following the hijacker's 
instructions, the 727 was fully refueled for a southbound flight and a refueling stop in 
Reno, Nevada, after which the plane would head across the U.S.-Mexico international 
border. The hijacker made no demands about the route to be flown. Instead, he gave the 
pilot instructions to fly with landing gear down, flaps set at 15-degrees, not exceed speed 
of 150 knots (172.5 mph), and not to fly above 10,000 feet altitude. The stewardess and 
three flight deck members were not to leave the crew compartment. As the stewardess 
closed the door she saw the man strapping a canvas sack about his waist. The man later 
known as D.B. Cooper was then alone in the large passenger compartment.<p>

<img src="images/route.gif" align=right>
About 8 o'clock the flight engineer saw a red "door open" warning light appear on his 
array of flight instruments. No specific door was indicated but the flight crew suspected 
it was for the passenger stairs in the aft section, beneath the plane's tail assembly and the 
rear-mounted engine. The 727 was the only plane to have such passenger access. At 8:10 
PM., 24 minutes into the flight south, the 727 crossed the Lewis River in southeast 
Washington, about 25 miles north of Portland. Author Gunther wrote: "Passing over the 
river, the plane performed an odd little curtsy and needed to be trimmed to bring it back 
to level flight." When the plane landed in Reno, D.B. Cooper was gone. So was the 
money and two parachutes. Nothing has never been ascertained about what happened to 
the man who commandeered the 727.<p>

Over the course of eighteen days after D.B. Cooper disappeared from the airplane a force 
of 200 soldiers from Fort Lewis Washington tramped across a ten-square-mile area in an 
intensive search of the rugged forested area over which it was calculated the skyjacker 
had bailed out of the 727. But there are also scattered farms on lower land areas, which 
would have made ideal landing areas. The FBI had used a computer to pinpoint his exit 
point as being over Lake Merwin, which was formed by damming the Lewis River.<p>

But no sign of the hijacker's body was found, nor any clue as to what happened to him-
no parachute or parts, no clothing, no money.<p>

<b>Scam Time</b><p>

A couple of crafty men later tried to capitalize on D.B. Cooper's daring deed. Instead 
they became captured and convicted criminals themselves. Just over a year later, in 
December 1972 two men were found guilty in a federal court of defrauding a former 
national magazine editor with a sham interview with skyjacker Cooper. The two men got 
$30,000 from the editor by having one of the men pose as the parachuting hijacker. After 
five hours of jury deliberation the two arrested men were found guilty on all of several 
counts of federal fraud charges.<p>

<b>Real Evidence</b><p>

On February 13, 1980 an Associated Press newspaper article reported that an eight-year-
old boy on a family picnic along the Columbia River, about five miles northwest of 
Vancouver, Washington, discovered $5,800 in three bundles of weathered $20 bills. The 
money-by its serial numbers-was identified by the FBI as part of the amount given to 
the hijacker.<p>

<b>The "Wannabe"</b><p>

Later in 1980, on July 12, a distraught young man, thought to be between the ages of 17-
20, and wearing mirrored aviator glasses, commandeered a Northwest Airlines 727 at the 
Seattle-Tacoma Airport as it taxied to a runway for a flight to Portland, Oregon. He said 
he had a bomb in his briefcase and demanded two parachutes. Some three hours into the 
standoff, the "wannabe" hijacker let women and children among the 52 passengers and 
seven crew members leave the airplane, now parked on a taxiway. A newspaper report 
later said, "A female flight attendant slipped [the man] three valiums in a drink." That 
apparently had a welcome effect on him since he later allowed all passengers and two 
crew members to also leave. The UPI newspaper report also said he "slowly reduced his 
demands from $100,000 and two parachutes to a rental car and three cheeseburgers." The 
confrontation lasted about ten hours before an FBI agent-an expert in hijacking 
situations-persuaded the young man to surrender. He was taken to a youth detention 
center and in court the next day he was charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-
degree extortion.<p>

<b>La-La Land Gives it a Try</b><p>

In 1981 Hollywood's Polygram Pictures produced a fanciful, highly speculative, 
romanticized, "what if" movie, "The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper," said to be based on the 
book "Free Fall." It starred Robert Duvall, Treat Williams, Kathryn Harrold, and Ed 
Flanders. The musical score included the song "Shine," written and sung by Waylon 
Jennings. But name actors and the singing of a renowned country musical star didn't help 
the picture. One reviewer called it "a disposable movie. " It didn't last long in 
theaters.<p>

<b>"Cooper Capers" / "Cooper Day"</b><p>

Five years after the skyjacking in 1976, the people of Ariel, Washington began 
celebrating the event with a "D.B. Cooper Party." One fan said, "I like to think the guy 
got away with it." Also, in 1984, members of the USAF squadron that sent two F-16s in 
pursuit of Cooper (locating only the plane, not the parachutist) held their own affair, the 
"D.B. Cooper Debacle Dining-In, " a formal dinner at McChord Air Force Base.<p>

Twenty years later annual parties, known as the "Cooper Caper" or "Cooper Day, " and 
always on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and including one or more parachute jumps, 
continue to be held at the Ariel Store and Tavern, says current owner Donna Elliott. She 
added that people from all over the world make it a point to visit Ariel to take part in the 
annual parties celebrating D.B. Cooper's spectacular escapade. "We even have a 
"Cooper's Corner" here in the store and tavern with all kinds of newspaper and magazine 
articles about D.B. Cooper."<p>

The criminal had become a cult hero.<p>
