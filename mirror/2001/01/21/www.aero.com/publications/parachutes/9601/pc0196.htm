<em>Joe Crane, of Mineola, New York, and proprietor of the Joe Crane & Co. Parachute 
Loft, was the first recipient of the A. Leo Stevens Memorial Fund Medal. It was presented 
to him on September 4, 1948 by Augustus Post at the Early Bird banquet held in the Hotel 
Carter, Cleveland, Ohio, during the National Air Races.<p>

"For having instructed several hundred students in parachute rigging and jumping; 
parachute construction consultant; and credited with having made 689 parachute 
jumps."</em><p>

<b>Airplane Awards</b><p>

There are many awards given for achievements in the airplane segment of the big picture 
of 
aviation. That's understandable, considering the countless kinds of airplanes and their 
many roles in civil and military aviation since the Wright brothers made their flights at Kill 
Devil Hill, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903.<p>

A little more than a decade later aerial combat was devised as yet another new mode of 
battle, altering both ground and naval warfare.<p>

In time of peace, flying machines were used in an amazing array of aviation endeavors -  
humanitarianism, meteorology, forest fire control, air/sea rescue, space research, 
entertainment, ad infinitum.<p>

Today, museums round the world are dedicated to glorifying and preserving airplanes and 
related artifacts and photographic and written history.<p>

<b>Balloon Awards</b><p>

Lower on the attention and preservation scale, balloons command small exhibits, though 
most material often remains in storage, waiting for more exhibition space in visitor areas; 
and perhaps there are several file drawers of documentation.<p>

However, there are many splendid medal and certificate awards for feats of ballooning— 
altitudes reached, distances traveled, outstanding design, lifting capacity, and other 
achievements.<p>

<b>Early Ballooning</b><p>

Huge bags, capable of carrying humans aloft—at first inflated with the heat of fires on the 
ground and later by airborne fires lifted with the balloon and tended by passengers—have 
been rising into the sky since November 21, 1783. On that day the Marquis d'Arlandes and 
Pilatre de Rozier, aboard their Montgolfier hand-crafted hot-air balloon, rose in the air and 
floated in gently moving air over the lofty towers of Notre Dame de Paris cathedral. Their 
flight lasted twenty minutes and two excited passengers landed safely. Human ascension 
into and passage through once unreachable heavens became realities.<p>

Early balloonists and glider and airplane pilots, each in their successive eras, were 
ridiculed, called hare-brained and fools. But soon afterward they were called high-minded 
adventurers, pioneers of a new frontier, heroic seekers of progress, daring visionaries. The 
mystique of aviation grew quickly. The thrill of rising into and being part of the sky 
attracted countless people to various modes of flight.<p>

However, the perils of flight did not escape the minds of some in aviation. They realized 
that trouble-free flight and safe landing could not be guaranteed. Though "Murphy's Law" 
had not yet been defined in the 18th century, it was nonetheless in effect—"Whatever can 
go wrong will go wrong—and at the worst possible moment!"<p>

That "worst possible moment" for balloonists came when fabric bags of heated air—and 
later dangerous flammable hydrogen gas—gave way and the passenger basket and 
collapsed fabric plunged to earth.<p>

One prudent balloonist prepared for such a contingency and his foresight paid off. Polish 
aeronaut Jordaki Kuparento took his "fire balloon" aloft for another of many exhibition 
ascensions for an eager public and rose above Warsaw on July 14, 1808. The basket had a 
container to serve as the portable heat source and bundles of straw for fuel. Hot air was 
generated by a large fire beneath the opening of the inflated balloon. Unexpectedly, at a 
"considerable altitude," the fire's flames reached the bag fabric, which burned rapidly. The 
balloon lost its form; Kuparento started his dreadful fall to earth.<p>

Restraining panic, Kuparento quickly equipped himself with a parachute he had wisely 
brought along. His lifesaving apparatus, carried aloft on all flights, was a foldable silk 
parachute he had made, one with hand grips at the ends of suspension lines. Firmly 
clutching the hand grips of his folded canopy, he launched himself from the basket. The 
canopy snapped open sharply, almost causing Kuparento to lose his tight grips; he hung on 
desperately and landed safely. Kuparento entered history as the first person to save his 
own 
life by using a parachute.<p>

In World War One scores of British soldiers saved themselves from burning to death or 
death by crashing into the ground. Not long after the British army had started sending 
tethered "kite" balloons above front lines in France to spot German artillery positions and 
troop and supply movements, the Germans countered ferociously with fighter planes 
setting hydrogen-filled balloons afire with incendiary bullets.<p>

<b>Early Powered Flight</b><p>

With the onset of powered flight, the likelihood of a fatal fall from on high had to be 
realistically faced. But that realization was cavalierly slow taking place because so many 
flights took off, flew, and landed without serious incident; so if nothing was going wrong 
why worry about nebulous probability?<p>

Powered aviation—affected by the law of diminishing returns—experienced its first 
fatality 
when U.S. Army Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge became the first person to lose his life in 
an airplane accident. During a demonstration flight to the army at Fort Myer, Orville 
Wright 
had Lt. Selfridge aboard as a passenger. Without warning, at 125 feet in the air, a 
propeller 
shattered and the stricken plane fell to earth. Lt. Selfridge died of a fractured skull and 
Orville suffered several fractures and severe shock.<p>

Now horrifyingly warned, most thinkers opined that safely escaping from a helpless falling 
aircraft was next to impossible, so early inventive efforts were for saving the craft itself, 
including passengers.<p>

The U.S. government issued many patents to designers of innovative parachute concepts 
for safely letting down planes and passengers in the short span between the Wrights' four 
flights and the start of the 1914-1918 "Great War' (later termed "World War One"). 
However, the U.S. Patent Office would grant patents for concepts only and there doesn't 
seem to be any record of most ideas ever reaching even a prototype stage.<p>

<b>Airplanes and Parachutes</b><P>

Germany was the first military organization to opt (albeit reluctantly) for saving the lives 
of 
flyers by equipping combat aircraft with static-line parachutes, similar to the stowage and 
deployment systems used by balloon personnel. In 1917 a German plane was destroyed by 
machine-gun fire from an Allied plane. The German pilot leaped overboard using a 
Heinecke seat-type parachute equipped with an eight-foot static line and landed safely, 
apparently becoming the first airplane pilot to save his life with a parachute.<p>

The Allies (equally reluctantly) also decided to save their most valuable resource—
people— 
and authorized parachutes for flying personnel. Before America could get parachutes to 
airmen in France, an armistice was signed and the war ended on November 11, 1918.<p>

Parachutes as a life-saving device were slowly accepted in aviation from 1920-onward and 
over the next 75 years great advancements were made in their technology and uses. Along 
that same route, parachutes were also used for recreation and for sporting events.<p>

<b>Parachute Awards</b><p>

Lowest on the attention, recognition, and preservation scale of aviation history are 
parachutes, parachuting, and parachutists.<p>

To complement awards presented to aviators and plane designers, and to the ballooning 
community, establishment of the A. Leo Stevens Memorial Fund was a major step in 
correcting aviation's oversight of recognizing people who made truly significant 
contributions to the art and science of parachutes and, most important, to saving human 
lives.<p>

A. Leo Stevens (1876-1944) was a pre-World War One exhibition balloonist and 
parachutist who later developed new concepts of parachute canopies and harnesses. 
Arthur 
Lapham and Frederick Law made exhibition static-line jumps with Stevens' parachutes, 
leaping from bridge, the Statue of Liberty, and airplanes.<p>

Static-line rigs, mounted on an aircraft, had saved lives in emergency situations but 
sometimes aviators were entangled in deploying suspension lines and canopy and died 
because they could not get clear of a spinning airplane.<p>

While Stevens was commercially designing and manufacturing various parachutes for 
making static-line jumps, he was also toiling to create a manually controlled parachute 
assembly that could be deployed by a free-falling aviator after leaping from a disabled 
aircraft. He had conceived a freefall parachute as early as 1908 but had not developed a 
practical rig.<p>

After World War One, Stevens was a member of a group of notable parachutists 
assembled 
at the U.S. Army's McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio to develop a reliable parachute for 
aviators.<p>

Floyd Smith and Leslie Irvin were compatriots of Stevens and other notable parachutists 
in 
the McCook Field group and Smith and Leslie had each independently arrived at similar 
configurations for a back-style freefall parachute assembly (though history is not clear as 
to 
who actually was first). Major Hoffman, commanding officer of the military unit charged 
with developing the emergency freefall parachute, assigned Irvin to make the first test 
jump 
with his prototype and Floyd Smith was pilot of the test aircraft. Irvin made his test 
freefall 
jump from an altitude of 1,500 feet. It was successful and a new age had arrived for 
aviation by proving that freefall parachuting was safe.<p>

This article opened with basic facts about the first presentation of the A. Leo Stevens 
Memorial Fund Medal to a venerable and honored figure in parachuting—Joe Crane. Now 
learn about the rest of a "baker's dozen" of recipients who were awarded the prestigious 
recognition annually through 1959 (including an additional special award in 1954).<p>

justice to the significance of their actual achievement. Hence, future columns will give 
more 
detailed accounts of exceptional parachute-related accomplishments of these A. Leo 
Stevens 
Parachute Medal winners.<p>
