<dd>Many aircraft pilots not at all interested in sport parachuting/skydiving have confessed 
to at least having an appreciation of a form of flight done by present-day skilled parachutists 
manipulating peculiar-looking flexible flying wings with a glide ratio of close to 4:1, a device 
that looks nothing like the customary idea of a parachute.  <br>
<dd> But aviators still don't like the idea of leaping from a plane or helicopter or balloon to 
achieve that manner of flight.  <br>
<dd> However, there are probably many aviators who have taken part in flights suspended 
beneath a specially designed "lifting canopy" commonly used as a recreational "parasailing" 
device at summer resorts in Mexico and on major inland waterways. If they've done so, they 
have been in touch with the parachuting side of aviation.  <br>
<dd> Those parasailing canopies are closer in appearance to a "conventional" parachute at a 
distance, but a close-up look shows many differences, particularly in the amount of canopy 
fabric missing from the customary hemispherical "sail"; customary i n the sense of what most 
people think of as a parachute.<p>

<dd> A parasail user, wearing a bathing suit and water safety gear, dons a harness connected 
by a long towline to a motor boat. The canopy laid out behind a "rider" starts to inflate and 
provide lift as the boat moves forward and the towline is tightened, tugging steadily on the 
canopy. As boat speed increases, greater lift is generated as air continually moves into the 
inflated canopy and through openings in the parachute fabric. More speed means more lift and 
both increase until a rider is taken aloft and towed at a height of as much as fifty feet. The motor 
boat makes wide turns and the parachute passenger enjoys a ride of several minutes. Landing is 
simply a matter of the boat slowing and maneuvering to let the canopy rider slowly descend into 
the water at the edge of the shore.<br>
<dd>  (This technique is also an advanced training method for USAF pilots and NASA 
astronauts to gain a real sense of a brief parachute descent under a canopy, to try canopy-
handling techniques,  and to practice how to safely separate from a harness and canopy in water 
landings.)<p>

<b>Changing Parachute Technology</b><p>
<dd> Constantly changing technology has produced a far more sophisticated form of 
parachute-canopy flight " paragliding.<br>
<dd> Sport parachutists " skydivers " for several years have used a radical "square" 
canopy (a misnomer; "ram-air" or "parafoil" is the appropriate term), a configuration designed 
to add to their enjoyment of the canopy ride portion of a parachute jump; and a configuration 
that makes possible astonishing results in precision parachuting competition events with 
parachutists accurately and repeatedly striking a minuscule target " a five-centimeter disk. (In 
world-class competitions the "dead center" disk measure only  <em>three</em> 
centimeters.)<p>

<dd> Most members of the aviation community are acquainted with the "round" canopies 
long used for emergency  jumps. A later version of a <em>round</em> canopy, substantially 
altered from a basic hemispheric configuration, resulted in remarkable improvement in 
steerability, rapid rotation, reduced rate of descent, and greatly improved horizontal movement. 
It was known as the "Para-Commander" ("P-C"), based on the earlier Lemoigne design for a 
"lifting canopy" (e.g., parasailing model described above). <br>
<dd> There were also later similar and dissimilar  designs that offered the same features as 
the P-C. Many latter-day aviators and aviation buffs are also familiar with the 
<em>square</em>  parachute canopies used by today's skydivers. The <em>squares</em> have 
been seen at countless airshows, fair grounds, amusement parks, and many other places where 
exhibition jumps have been made, as well as at drop zones of parachute clubs. Spectators are 
generally amazed by the extraordinary maneuverability of the parachutes and with the great 
distances that can be traveled under canopy, plus the amazingly light, standing touch-downs. 
Gone are the "crash and burn" landings.<p>

 <dd>A "square" is not really square. Its form today is noticeably rectangular, with 
measurement from side to side (span) greater than from front to rear (chord). However, early 
models were distinctly squarish in appearance, though still just barely rectangular. But the 
<em>square</em> term lingered and is still generally used in sport parachuting/skydiving.<br>
 In construction a <em>square</em>  (more properly termed a "ram-air" canopy) is a double-
surfaced flexible flying wing made of lightweight, zero-permeability (often mistakenly referred 
to as <em>porosity</em>) fabric with top and bottom surfaces joined along the trailing edge. 
The front of the canopy is open across the width, and height between top and bottom surfaces 
varies with the design of a given canopy model. <p>

<a href="images/paragl1.gif"><img src="images/paragl1t.gif"></a>
</center><p>

<dd> Structural front-to-rear "ribs" are at prescribed points in the width and separate the span 
into "cells," providing a general identifier of a canopy type (e.g., 5-cell, 7-cell, 9-cell, and so 
on).  The ribs generally have one or more "crossports" to aid air flow inside the canopy during 
initial inflation at canopy deployment. The "ram air" in the cells maintains the canopy shape, 
giving it the appearance of a wing. With the wing positioned to fly at a scientifically determined 
angle of attack by attachment to suspension lines, extraordinary glide ratios, in excess of 4:1, are 
routinely achieved. With such ratios, parachute rates of descent have also been reduced from 
more than a thousand feet a minute to less than eight hundred. A former two-minute or less 
canopy ride from 2,000 feet has been extended nearly three times, mostly depending on a 
jumper's weight and canopy characteristics.  <p>

<b>Ram-Air Canopies Result in Glide Ratios</b><p>
<dd> With <em>square</em> canopies proving exceptional, a lot of attention has been paid 
for several recent years to capitalizing on the once negligible glide ratio of a parachute 
canopy.<br>
<dd> Experimentation began by skydivers using their ram-air canopies to launch from high 
natural slopes and striving to soar in the sky by using lifting air currents, much in the manner of 
hang glider pilots. Their goal was to use the known glide ratio of existing canopies to experience 
the pleasures and excitement of soaring, at a far less cost than purchasing a hang glider and 
learning to fly it.  After all, an inquisitive sport parachutist already had a ram-air rig, so why not 
try to get the most bang for a buck; find out how to make the canopy fly better and for longer 
times and greater distances.<br>
<dd> In a relatively short time a modicum of success was achieved, a new aviation capability 
was realized, a new recreational aviation activity was born - paragliding<p>

<b>Skydiver Canopies Turn Into Paraglider Canopies</b><p>
 <dd>Years of earnest effort have been put into developing paraglider technology, improving 
enjoyment, and promulgating safe practices. The rectangular form of the ram-air canopies used 
by sport jumpers steadily evolved into an elliptical form, of greater span and with more canopy 
cells. Other refinements produced an even more suitable gliding design. A new "flying machine" 
resulted.<p>
 
<dd> A countrywide network of instructors, schools, and equipment manufacturers and 
dealers has sprung up. Competitive events for landing accuracy, time aloft, and altitude gain are 
held at local, regional, national, and world-meet levels. <br>
 The format of competitive events varies. For example, at one annual <em>United States 
Paragliding Championships</em>, the task for contestants was to fly a triangular course set on 
the north side of a ridge, with two turn points about a mile apart, and with a third point a few 
hundred yards out on the edge of the lower bench. Two heats were held on separate days, one of 
one hour, the other of two hours. There were 48 contestants, and some came from France, 
Germany, Austria, and Japan.<p>

Other U.S.competitions have included:<p>
<li><em>World Paragliding Speed Races</em>, Torrey Pines, California<br>
<li><em>APA Rocky Mountain Regionals</em>, Sun Valley, Idaho<br>
<li><em>APA Dino-Soar Regionals</em>, Dinosaur, Colorado<br>
<li><em>APA National Championship</em>, Owens Valley, California<p>

 <dd>As another example of increasingly demanding skills needed, at a Torrey Pines, 
California  head-to-head competition the flight course was a mile long (1.5 km). After launching 
simultaneously, two pilots flew in opposite directions toward their first turn points. A 180-
degree turn after reaching the first turn point was required to be above the cliff edge. Then flying 
toward each other, passing in front of the launch point, pilots were required to observe right-of-
way rules. Continuing toward the other half of the figure-8 course, one more turn had to be made 
above the cliff edge. Then followed a bee-line for the finish, with the first one to cross above the 
cliff edge being the winner. The event was a double elimination process in the first round - if a 
contestant lost after one round, the pilot was finished.<p>
 
<dd> There are many paragliding competitions held regularly. Though it might seem that 
California, with its incredible number of sunny days and 800 or so miles of coastline and 
countless sand dunes might be the "center of the universe" for paragliders, the Colorado cities of  
Crested Butte, Aspen, and Boulder each have high numbers of paraglider pilots, resulting in a 
higher percentage of such pilots (relative to the total population of the community) than other 
cities cities of the United States. The mountainous regions of other parts of the country, and in 
many foreign countries as well, provide excellent flight conditions.	<p>
 
 <dd>Flights of extraordinary distance, flight time, and altitude gain are commonplace as 
technology continues improving and new techniques are learned.<br>
<dd> Using a specially designed "sling" seat for comfort and ease of canopy handling (rather 
than remaining with the customary shoulder-level harness suspension points of conventional 
skydiving equipment), paragliders have made many exceptional flights.  Here are some 
achievements at sites in California a few years back:<p>

<li>Clayton Wooley, on his third day of paragliding, flew for over an hour.  When he had made 
10 paragliding flights he had accumulated over five hours of air time.<br>
<li>Tony Domenico, a veteran paraglider pilot, launched himself from a 400-foot training hill 
and soared to 3,150 feet - an altitude gain record for that site at that time.<br>
<li>Jack Bonar made 66 flights in just over a month.  On the 66th, he flew for over an hour and 
said he only landed because his spouse wanted to go home.<br>
<li>Student John Ninomiya launched his first-ever thermal-only flight and managed to stay up 
for two hours and climbed more than 2,000 feet above his launch altitude.<br>
<li>Michael Willingham also launched at the same time as John Ninomiya and made a 
multihour flight with altitude gains of 1,000 to 3,000 feet higher than his launch site.<br>
<li>Dave Bridges launched from the "E" at Elsinore and headed out for his first cross-country 
flight. He flew more than 15 miles and reached the Perris Parachute Center, northeast of his 
launch site. Radio-equipped, he called the airport for permission to land, and flew to a landing 
in front of a large, cheering crowd of skydivers and spectator.<br>
<li>After the annual Elsinore Competition, contestant Lee Kaiser went for a "fun flight" and 
managed to get to 5,000 feet above his launch site. Then he caught a local "shear" (the 
terminator between the moist sea breeze and the dry desert air) and began working it. The shear 
moved inland toward the desert as the day progressed and Lee worked to stay with it, heading 
east from Lake Elsinore, on a cross-country attempt to Soboba. Sixteen miles later he was over 
the town of Winchester and up against the smoke of a major grass fire and the aircraft activity 
of the firefighters.  Disappointed that his flight distance was cut short, but in good spirits 
nonetheless, Lee turned back toward Lake Elsinore and completed an "out and return" trip of 
32 miles. Someone remarked: "If only Lee could have managed this during the previous 
week's competition, he just might have had first place in his pocket." <p>

 <dd>Richard Bach, longtime general aviation pilot, famed novelist, and aviation writer, 
published an article on paragliding in the June 1992 issue of the AOPA Pilot, the monthly 
publication of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. The article spanned 10 pages and 
included eight full-color photographs. Bach is best known for his book-writing prowess, 
particularly for "Jonathan Livingston Seagull." His other books were "Biplane," "One," 
"Stranger to the Ground," "Nothing by Chance," "Illusions," and "The Bridge Across Forever." 
As a flyer, he is a commercial pilot and helicopter pilot, with instrument, seaplane, multiengine, 
and glider ratings,<p>
 <dd>Bach, who learned how to fly a paraglider in 1991, wrote the <em>AOPA Pilot</em> 
article about his experiences as a student of Mike Eberle of North American Paragliding in 
Washington state. Bach has since traveled about the country on paragliding adventures and has 
flown at many different sites.<p>
 
 <dd>Paragliding seems a relatively inexpensive way to - paraphrasing John Gillespie 
Magee Jr., - "slip the surly bonds of earth,...to wheel and soar and swing, high in the sunlit 
silence"; it's less costly and more accessible than an airplane, balloon, or conventional 
glider.<p>

 <dd>To enjoy yet another of the many forms of flight, aviators surely might want to take a 
closer look at that wondrous device - the parachute, which has been put to an originally 
unanticipated use. Now there's the PARAGLIDER!<p>
