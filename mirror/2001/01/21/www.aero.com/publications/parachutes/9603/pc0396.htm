The following account is based on personal conversations with a highly experienced test 
pilot who, in his long careen had flown over 100 types of aircraft ranging from small 
single-engine general aviation planes to the nation's most advanced jet fighter planes to the 
huge S-engine B-52 long-range bombers. Paul Berk, veteran aviator with over 10,000 
hours of flying time, most of it "wringing out" aircraft gave the manuscript a "reality 
check."<p>

Test pilot Paul Berk's first emergency bailout was in 1943, from a fiery F6F fighter being 
tested before return to the U.S. Navy after engine overhaul by Pratt and Whitney Aircraft 
(now a division of United Technologies) in East Hartford, Connecticut. His second 
emergency jump happened eight years later - in 1951, again over Connecticut - after 
numerous other test flights in the intervening years, tests of many and varied aircraft, 
including genuine forced landing predicaments (not simply practice "emergencies" to 
simulate something or other gone wrong). Fortunately, all the forced landings ended 
well.<p>

The second bailout was not the extremely harrowing adventure the first had been, but 
neither was it without several bewildering seconds for the now experienced 
parachutist.<p>

In 1943, Paul Berk, a twenty-six-year-old Pratt & Whitney test pilot, was flying a 
Grumman F6F-3 Navy fighter, making high-speed runs over southern New England to test 
maximum fuel temperature operating limits for various conditions.<p>

With the throttle to the firewall on a hundred-fifty-mile course between Boston, 
Massachusetts - staying short of the densely populated city - and rural Mount Kisco, New 
York, Berk roared into his second high-speed turn over the small eastern New York town 
and headed for Boston again. From 28,000 feet, the wide Hudson River looked like a 
small stream. The air was so clear he could see Hartford, Connecticut in the distance. He 
made notations on the data board strapped to his right thigh.<p>

Seconds later the R-2800-10 engine quit momentarily, then ran smoothly again. Berk 
quickly and anxiously scanned the instruments.<p>

WHUMP! A loud noise sounded outside the plane, from up ahead.<p>

Perk could see a large hole on the top right part of the engine cowling, and there were high-
pitched rattling engine sounds, then flames. Hot oil spattered the windshield. It poured 
from the cowling hole, thickly smearing the canopy, obstructing Berk's vision. Smoke 
poured through the firewall into the cockpit, shutting out the bright sun.<p>

Berk had never needed to make a parachute jump, but he knew he had no time now for 
pondering whether he had a choice. Flashes of worries punched his mind. He thought how 
little he knew about a parachute. A long time ago someone had said, "Here ! Put it over 
your shoulders like a jacket - fasten the chest and leg snaps, then tighten the straps. If you 
have to use it, dive over the side and pull the ripcord!"<p>

He wondered if there would be enough oxygen in the bail-out bottle stowed in the leg 
pocket of his flight suit to last him from his 28,000-foot altitude until he descended to ten 
or twelve thousand feet. He remembered his high altitude chamber physiological training 
session. He remembered another young pilot there who volunteered for a demonstration 
and was unconscious in seconds after a chamber attendant removed the volunteer's mask at 
the simulated altitude of 30,000 feet.<p>

Berk hastily probed the thick smoke for the fuel shut-off control. His bare hand was licked 
by bright flames. He plunged his hand into the fire, groping for the fuel handle. Flame shot 
back from the firewall, raging at Berk's other hand gripping the joystick, flaring at his 
face.<p>

He couldn't get to the fuel shut-off handle. Instead, he used his badly burned hand to tug at 
the canopy release, committing himself to getting out of plane before becoming trapped. 
There was no time to first slow the plane's high speed. Fast-moving air swirled the thick 
smoke in the cockpit when the canopy slid back. Berk released fittings on seat and shoulder 
belts. The sound of the thundering, swirling airstream made him think he might not be able 
to escape and he worked harder.<p>

He rolled the fighter sharply upside down, clenched the parachute ripcord handle with his 
right hand, then let himself fall from the cockpit. The several-hundred-mile-an-hour airflow 
smashed at his body, snapping his head and arms and legs about. His limbs struck things 
as he fell from the compartment. He felt his oxygen mask tear loose from over his mouth 
and nose. High altitude equipment was not as sophisticated as it is today and the mask was 
held in place only by a narrow piece of elastic. Berk described it as "about the same type 
used for a woman's garter." His official report stated, "I felt my arm catch on something, 
probably the radio extension cords, saw the tail of the airplane go by, and felt a jolt, at 
which time I lapsed into unconsciousness...."<p>

A long period of blackness turned gray, then to brightness, then to brilliant, light blue as 
consciousness returned. The sun swept across his sight, moving quickly from left to right. 
Berk looked down at his body, at his hands. Details came into focus. He felt like he was 
bouncing about in the parachute harness and looked above his head at the white silk 
canopy. A sudden fright engulfed him. There were huge holes in the fabric - and the 
canopy wasn't round-shaped at all. Part of the bottom edge fluttered wildly as the parachute 
jerked about from side to side, then whipped about in half-circles. His mind cleared as 
oxygen became sufficient at his altitude. Berk tugged ferociously on suspension lines, 
several at a time at first, one hand at a time, then two-handedly. He swore loudly in 
frustration, unable to stop oscillations and twisting. He wondered how fast he was 
falling.<p>

The report to P&amp;W officials and the U.S. Navy said, a bit more objectively the next 
day: "At about fifteen thousand feet I regained consciousness and noticed that I was 
rotating rapidly in circles which prompted me to look at the chute. What I saw had me 
wondering the rest of the way down. The parachute was torn through the middle from end 
to end with a long slit in a third panel. I tried to pull different lines to stop the rotation, but 
to no avail. As I got close to the ground, I first realized how fast I was dropping and hit the 
ground with a 'whomp' and doubled up and rolled down a slope .... <p>

Berk was knocked out by his thumping landing, but was uninjured, except for slight pain 
in his left knee and ankle.<p>

Spectators came to his rescue, and took him for medical treatment for his burned hands and 
face. Later he returned to the crash site with New York state police. Berk concluded his 
two-page official report thus: "The airplane was completely disintegrated and the remains of 
the engine were embedded about ten feet in the ground. The propeller was not with the 
engine but spectators said it was located a few miles away. The remains of the airplane 
were strewn about the countryside over an area of a few miles. The State Police of New 
York and Connecticut very kindly relayed me to Rentschler Field with my belongings 
which consisted of a throat mike, a data board and chronograph, and a badly torn but 
treasured parachute."<p>

Berk told the author that he could still vividly recall the agonizing, unendurable moments in 
the fiery cockpit. "I would," he said, "have jumped from that plane even if I didn't have a 
parachute. You can't imagine such pain! I would not have let myself die that way!"<p>

His love of flying made him impatient as company medical personnel made him wait until 
burns healed sufficiently to clear him for test duty.<p>

Eight years later - in 1951 - Paul Berk made another emergency bailout, that time from a 
U.S. Navy F9F-5 jet fighter undergoing P&amp;W's testing. At the time, he was among 
the first pilots in the country to make an emergency bailout using an ejection seat.<p>

After an hour's flight of routine testing in the Grumman jet, and at .9 Mach - almost 
reaching the speed of sound - the sleek plane's power plant flamed out at forty-thousand 
feet. Berk could not relight the flame-out and anxiously searched the area below for a place 
to land the powerless aircraft.<p>

Nothing! He was losing altitude quickly - and his radio was not working! He couldn't tell 
anyone what was happening. At five-thousand-foot intervals Berk tried restarting the 
engine, without success.<p>

<font size=3>Test Pilot Paul Berk inspects the cowling of his jet fighter from which he 
parachuted to safety from 6,000 feet after the craft failed to respond properly.  The cowling 
was ejected from the plane when the pilot pressed an emergency button used in throwing 
the pilot free of the craft. The wreckage was found several miles from Berk's point of 
landing in Glastonbury.<p>

By 6,000 feet he knew he would have to leave the disabled aircraft, so he adjusted the 
planes control surfaces to set it on a descent path that would take it into a broad stretch of 
dense woods surrounded by expanses of farmland. His official report stated: "When I 
knew the plane was dropping toward the woods, I pushed the ejector button, waited for the 
cowl to drop off, and then was thrown into space."<p>

As soon as Berk pushed the button that started the ejection sequence, he quickly reached up 
and grasped two rope loop handles built into the top of the seat, and yanked down a canvas 
shield designed to protect a pilot's face during ejection. The entire seat assembly shot up 
quickly, powerfully launched from the disabled plane by small rockets. Berk felt himself 
buffeted harshly in the one-hundred-sixty-knot (184 mph) airstream and anxiously waited 
for gyrations to be stopped by the drogue chute designed to immediately deploy and 
stabilize the seat so a pilot could push away from the seat and then deploy a back-style 
parachute. But the seat kept tumbling and twisting wildly. The drogue system attached to 
the seat unit had failed.<p>

On the ground a surveyor and his assistant heard an unusual screech, then a loud pop, and 
"looked up to see a parachute open and the pilot floating down to earth." Berk later said to 
newspaper reporters that "the puff of smoke was caused by the ejector mechanism which 
also accounted for the 'pop' heard by the surveyors."<p>

Berk had quickly sensed that the high-speed ejection procedure was not going as it was 
supposed to and let go of the face-shield loops and pushed himself awkwardly out of the 
bulky metal seat, in the manner he would have used for separating from the drogue-
stabilized ejection unit. He worried about being hit by the heavy tumbling seat as he 
manually deployed his parachute by pulling the back-style parachute's ripcord.<p>

(Automatic inertial take-up reels had not yet been completely developed. Such reels, in later 
seat models, when suddenly actuated, super-quickly reeled in loose wide webbing secured 
between low and high points of the ejection seat assembly. When slack, the webbing 
followed the inside contour of the seat and back of ejection unit. When actuated by the pilot 
initiating the ejection procedure, the strong webbing had a "snapping" type of action as it 
straightened and shortened between lower and upper seat mountings, thereby forcefully 
thrusting a pilot free of a confining seat, followed by automatic actuation of a pilot's 
parachute. But that sophisticated system was still only in advanced testing.)<p>

Paul Berk clutched at the place on his left side of his chest where he knew the ripcord ought 
to be, felt what he thought sure was the handle in its pocket, and yanked with all the force 
he could muster. He had instinctively and fortunately done the right thing and the parachute 
canopy deployed and inflated properly.<p>

Berk, in his parachute descent, drifted a considerable distance from where he had left the 
plane to where he landed. Slipping down through a stand of thin, new-tree growth, he 
landed roughly, but without a scratch.<p>

Another spectator, by chance, looked up to watch the plane at six thousand feet, "when 
suddenly he saw 'a puff of smoke' and then the pilot shooting from the craft. He followed 
the path of the parachute and then drove to the scene to help."<p>

Two National Guard aircraft, a Pratt & Whitney helicopter, and several observation planes 
joined in a search for the crash site. The scattered wreckage of the fighter was finally 
located, after a long, exhausting hunt, about a mile from where the parachutist had landed. 
But it was a difficult search. Berk had precisely aimed his helpless plane and only after two 
civilian searchers had lighted a smudge fire in dense woods was the helicopter pilot able to 
fly to the wreckage and radio map coordinates to other searchers, four hours after the 
veteran test pilot had ejected from the fighter plane.<p>

Paul Berk was mandatorily retired as P&amp;W's Senior Test Pilot when he reached the 
company's age limit. By then he had spent more than four decades as a flight instructor, 
experimental aircraft pilot, tester of jet fighters and bombers, and recreational small plane 
aviator. His desire to fly has not diminished and he flies at every opportunity, occasionally 
airlifting skydivers so they can make parachute jumps for fun.<p>

Twice in his long, interesting, and exciting flying career he was able to fly again because of 
parachutes.<p>
