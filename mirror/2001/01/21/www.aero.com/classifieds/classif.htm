<h3>Art, Historic Articles, Publications</h3>

I paint nose art or other artwork on leather jackets.  I've also been active with the Lone Star Flight Museum for several years and got started painting jackets when I could not find anyone to paint my A-2 with the nose art of the B-17 I flew to airshows in. So I did it myself and haven't stopped yet. My work is  very detailed and the paints I use hold up very well. I have done many jackets for local civilian and military fliers.
