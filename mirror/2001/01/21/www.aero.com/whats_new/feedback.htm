<a href="/fbo/cpa/index.html"><b>California Pilots Association</b></a><br>
<i>The California Pilots Association, a nonprofit organization dedicated to
preserving airports and representing the interests of pilots throughout the
state of California, has been able to send its message literally around the
world because of the Internet access and services provided by Aero.com. CPA
receives messages from pilots as far away as Europe and Australia, as well 
as its constituency in California. The CPA web site on Aero.com has proven to be
an invaluable communication tool leading to a steady increase in our membership
rolls.<br>

<a href="http://www.eagle-editions.com/"><b>Eagle Editions Ltd.</b></a><br>
<i>About a year ago, when we made the decision to have a web site, we were
highly skeptical as to its effectiveness. Since our site is
comprehensive in terms of listing all our products and the historical
stories behind each one, it took several months to develop and perfect.
We continue to add products and update as needed. <br>
Working with Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Holliday has made creation and maintainence of our site exciting and rewarding. In the first month of operation we recouped
our initial investment plus! Sales have continued to climb and one year
later we are thoroughly convinced that the web is a viable advertising
medium for us. The professionalism displayed by Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's knowledgeable
input no doubt contributed to a successful launch of our site.  Our firm is 
looking forward to continued relationship with Aero.com and
positive sales response to our site. <br>

<i>...You of all people know what the Internet has done for U.S. Wings Inc. after you took us under your wings and helped us!  We, like a lot of companies, did not know anything about marketing on the Internet until we met Aero.com and we greatly appreciate all the time you spent with us and did not charge us like the rest of the Service Providers on the Internet did and do! Many Internet Service/Presence Providers over-charge for the service they give because of lack of knowledge...<br>
