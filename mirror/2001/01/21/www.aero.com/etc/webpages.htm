Considering going high tech with the Internet for sales and marketing 
communications?  We are not an Internet Service Provider - our goal is to provide 
access to the spirit of aviation!  Aero.com offers your business, association or school 
the opportunity to make your information available worldwide, 24 hours a day by 
providing presence on the Internet using the latest technology - the World Wide 
Web.<p>

Whether your customer's interest is in flying off for the weekend, jumping out of a 
Skyhawk, inflating an Aerostar at 6 a.m. or learning the theory of aerodynamics - we 
offer you a unique opportunity to reach your market.  Our focus on aviation makes 
Aero.com a point of research to users on the Internet. This focus greatly increases 
traffic through your site and the possibility that your pages will reach your clientele, 
aviation professionals and enthusiasts.  Aero.com's concept is actively marketed in 
the publishing industry and on the Internet.  Links to and from other aviation servers 
are also actively maintained.</b><p>

<b><u>Programming/Rendering</u></b><br>
</td><td>
If you are an ace at HTML you may provide the source code and images yourself... or 
leave the details to us. Basic HTML authoring is simple and we will help you learn it free of 
charge with a commitment for space on our server. Image rendering is a little more complex: 
though we are not equipped to instruct others we can do the rendering for you by special 
arrangement at a nominal cost.<p>

<b><u>Features</u></b><br>

The Web has many unique and powerful features, i.e. forms processing, interactive pages, 
text search, and point-of-sale applications. We will work with you to create a Web 
application suited to your functional and financial needs - whether it be informative or 
sales- oriented.<p>
