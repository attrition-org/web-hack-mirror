<center><h2>ALL ABOUT AERO.COM</h2></center>

Aero.com is an Internet marketing firm specializing in niche market strategies.  Our main web site focuses on general aviation and is an excellent resource for pilots, skydivers, balloonists and just enthusiasts.  We provide editorial content, a flight planning walk-through including links to weather briefing sites, weight and balance calculation, pilot logbook software, classifieds, assistance with research, lists of contact information on schools, museums, associations and drop zones as well as a very focused vehicle for aviation related firms to market themselves.  In other words our structure is very similar to that of an online magazine.<p>

Our main business funnels through our <a href="../fbo/fbo.htm">"Aviation Yellow Pages"</a> wherein we market our aviation clienteles' web sites.  We create, host and market web sites and will also host for those who are skilled in HTML and create pages as a side line for others, regardless of the industry.  Part of our service is to educate our clients about the Internet and how best to market themselves in this new medium as well as try to protect them from losing the shirt off their back.  Our clients receive not only a link from the Yellow Pages but also any other areas on our site which cover their industry.  We register them with search engines such as Yahoo, Lucos, InfoSeek, AltaVista and WebCrawler, request domain names, advise of newsgroup activity which might be interested in learning of their new presence and generally guide them and give them new marketing ideas.  <p>

Aero.com was founded in 1994 by Blake and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Holliday with the intent of combining their many years of experience in sales, marketing and the computer industry with their biggest passion - aviation.  Blake is currently working on his IFR ticket and is a skydiver at heart.  His logged hours include rotor wing, soaring and up to a Cessna T210 in the fixed wing category. His career in computers started when the Cray was popular and has continued to stay with current hardware and software technology  through today's Internet and electronic commerce issues.  Th&eacute;r&egrave;se will acquire both ultralight and fixed wing licenses later this year and completed AFF training (Accelerated Free Fall - skydiving) a few years ago. Her background is in international sales and marketing, at one time representing her then-employer in the computer industry on four continents. She has travelled extensively both on business and for pleasure, bringing a global approach to her current work with Internet clientele.<p>
