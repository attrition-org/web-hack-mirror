<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">QUOTE "<i>We allowed the hacker 
  to proceed with the break-in so that we could track him,'' said Ivoli.com chief 
  executive officer Rama Krishnan. "We managed to get his unique network card 
  number as well as his Internet Protocol (IP) address. "We also know that the 
  hacking originated from Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur, and we have submitted the 
  IP address to the Malaysian Computer Emergency Response Team (MyCERT),'' he 
  said</i>. END QUOTE</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">We will not cease to smash all 
  so-called secure servers until MyCERT and Mimos Berhad submit to the fact our 
  internet security are too weak to resist any local intrusion, what more if they 
  are from foreign threat?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">We will cease these attacks once 
  our conditions are met. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Condition #1. NSTP will retract 
  their bogus article and admit that they are most short-sighted and lack the 
  correct information to publish their article on the 14th of January 2001. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Condition #2. MyCERT and their 
  representitive will retract their statement on that same article </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">QUOTE "<i>Hacking is a deplorable 
  act of industrial espionage, costing time and money to rectify. "With the Internet 
  becoming more ubiquitous, it has opened up vast potential vulnerable sites and 
  increased the rampancy of computer and website hacking. Security and privacy 
  remains an industry-wide problem," he says</i>. END QUOTE </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Condition #3. Malaysian internet 
  security are below any internet security standards and it is laughable that 
  we are the pioneers of the MultiMedia Super Corridor. (By the way, we do not 
  HAVE any paper qualification or certification in any related field in computers 
  or etc. So please don't say any "school boy" can hack into a server. REMEMBER 
  WE OWNED YOU!!!!! THIS IS UNDERGROUND DAEMON CREW TALKING) </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Unless these conditions are met 
  and published to all local and foreign media within the next 48 hours, we will 
  then proceed to "test" and continue our research on Malaysian internet security 
  bugs. </font></p>
