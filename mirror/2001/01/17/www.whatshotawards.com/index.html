<BR>
Another one got caught today, it's all over the school.<BR>
"The dorky kid got caught jerking off in the girls toilets"...<BR>
Damn nerds. They're all alike.<BR>
<BR>
But did you, in your three-piece lurex body suit and 1960's Woodstock
fried acid brain,<BR>
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?<BR>
Did you ever wonder what made him sick, what forces shaped him, what
may have molded him?<BR>
I am a hacker, enter my world...<BR>
<BR>
Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, that's why they pick on me...<BR>
Damn geeks. They're all alike.<BR>
<BR>
I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how important personal hygiene is .<BR>
I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't bathe this week. I don't
like water..."<BR>
Damn kid. Allergic to soap. They're all alike.<BR>
<BR>
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is
cool.<BR>
It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times" COLOR="#FFFFFF">..Or I'm running
windows.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Not because it doesn't like
me...<BR>
Or pokes fun at me...<BR>
Or thinks I,m creepy...<BR>
Or wants to puke when I squeeze my zits...<BR>
Damn kid. All he does is pick his nose. They're all alike.<BR>
<BR>
And then it happened... a door opened to a world...<BR>
blood rushing through my weener like heroin through an addict's
veins,<BR>
an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the sexual
frustrations is sought... porn is found.<BR>
"This is it... this is where I belong..."<BR>
I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never jerk over them again... I love you all...<BR>
Damn kid. Using up all the tissues again. They're all alike...<BR>
<BR>
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been sneered at at school
when we hungered for friends...<BR>
Our heads stuffed down toilets and butt whipped with towels...<BR>
We've been dominated by big boys, and ignored by the girls.<BR>
The few that had something to say found us strange, but those few are
like drops of sand in the desert.<BR>
<BR>
This is our world now... the world of the hard-on and the bitch, the
beauty of the breast.<BR>
We make use of a service already existing, paying for what could be
free , if we could get a real woman.<BR>
and you call us geeks.<BR>
We explore our sexuality... and you call us geeks<BR>
We can speak fluid h4x0r... and you call us geeks.<BR>
We exist without confidence, without friends , without charisma...
and you call us geeks.<BR>
You build nightclubs , you play football, you don't collect
scripts,<BR>
you try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the
geeks.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of being different.<BR>
My crime is that of spending hours scanning for vulnerabilities , yet
you tell me to get a life .<BR>
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never
care about.<BR>
The worm has now turned , now I'll bully you , in this techno age I
am in charge.<BR>
You are all newbies , and now I look down on you.<BR>
<BR>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.<BR>
You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all,
we're all alike.<BR>
