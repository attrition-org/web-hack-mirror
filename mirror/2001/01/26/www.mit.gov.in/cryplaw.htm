<p><a NAME="Intro"></a><u><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Introduction</font></font></u>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>Privacy and data security have been
important issues since the dawn of the computer age, but they did not originate
with the computer. Paper records and files can also threaten personal privacy
or reveal other confidential or sensitive information. Long before computers
were invented, most organisations kept their critical files under lock
and key and restricted access to them to maintain security.
<p>&nbsp;Computer made data is more easily transportable, easier to copy
and far easier to manipulate. In the beginning the computers were mainframe,
residing in a central processing facility.
<p>&nbsp;Users of computer could be logged in and out. But once desktop
terminals and personal computers made it possible to use files without
physically entering a central processing facility or requesting a print
out, controlling access became much more difficult.
<p>&nbsp;Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing into 1970s, the computer
industry itself and most major users came to understand the problems created
by the new technology. The users developed their own codes and data security
systems to deal with them.
<p>&nbsp;The emergence and growth of Internet, banking by computer, electronic
commerce and other forms of network computing have changed the situation.
The new massively interconnected environment and the number of users is
growing at a geometric rate. The volume of information available through
the system is already incomprehensively large and increasing rapidly.
<p>&nbsp;With the introduction of electronic commerce, lot of personal
information will be available on the Internet, namely, credit card numbers,
transaction data, preferences about the choice of the product, medical
and insurance records, personal files, even data kept on their personal
computers. Organisations on the Internet, including corporations, Government
universities and other non-profit institutions have a worry that hackers
or competitors or unauthorised persons may enter their systems and engage
in fraudulent financial transactions, manipulate records or sabotage computers
themselves.
<p>&nbsp;The quest to establish trust in the emerging system on the part
of individual users, service providers, retailers and, in fact, everyone
who will be connected on the system, voiced down to assuring the protection
of personal privacy and data security.
<p>&nbsp;1.2 Cryptography technology and process used to encode (encrypt)
and subsequently, to decode (decrypt) information to prevent its being
read by unauthorised party is a major component of the complete data security
system. It has been used extensively in the past and continues to be used
by Governments to protect military secrets and exchanges with overseas
Embassies. It is also enjoyed by corporations to protect confidential data
by financial institutions exchanging payment data and other sensitive information,
by social security, administration of many countries to protect the privacy
of personal information and by many other users.
<p>&nbsp;As the Internet and Global Information Infrastructure continue
to evolve, particularly as electronic commerce becomes a reality and vastly
increasing volumes of information are exchanged among users over global
telecommunication networks, the customers demand for cryptography solutions
to the security needs is growing rapidly. Even individual users are showing
their substantial interest in the availability of cryptography tools, users
are concerned about the privacy of their personal data and about possible
disclosure of credit card, banking and other sensitive information when
their computers are linked to the World Wide Web.
<p><a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
<p><a NAME="Basics of crypto"></a><font size=+1>2.0 <u>Basics of Cryptography</u></font>
<p>2.1 <u>Cryptography</u>
<p>&nbsp;Cryptography is the science and art of secret writing - keeping
information secret. When applied in a computing environment, cryptography
can protect data against unauthorised disclosure; it can authenticate the
identity of a user or programmer requesting service; and it can disclose
unauthorised tampering.
<p>&nbsp;As a concept, cryptography goes back several thousand years, arguably
to Egyptian Hieroglyphics and certainly to ancient India and Greece wherever,
in both cases, it was used for communication with spies, military commandos
and envoys to foreign Governments. Such uses continue to dominate well
into the 20th century.
<p>&nbsp;With the advent of electronic commerce, encryption is also becoming
an active concern for individual consumer reluctant to put credit card
numbers and other personal information on-line without the assurance that
their data cannot be captured by other party.
<p>2.2 <u>Encryption</u>
<p>Encryption is basically a process in which a message called plain text
is transformed into another message called a cipher text using a mathematical
function and a special encryption password called the key. Decryption is
a reverse process.
<p>Current encryption technology generates ciphers via computer hardware
and software enjoying sophisticated mathematical formulae or algorithms.
<p>Encryption when used in communications, is the manipulation of a packet’s
data in order to prevent any but the intended recipient from reading that
data. The process of encryption and decryption is shown in the basic term
below.
<p>2.3 <u>Advantages of Encryption</u>
<p>Encryption can protect information stored on the computer from unauthorised
access - even from people who otherwise have access to your computer system.
<p>Encryption can protect information while it is in transit from one computer
system to another.
<p>Encryption can be used to deter and detect accidental or international
alteration in the data.
<p>Encryption can be used to verify author of a document.
<p>Despite these advantages, encryption has its limits;
<p>Encryption cannot prevent an attacker from deleting the data altogether.
<p>The attacker can compromise the encryption programme itself. The attacker
might modify the programme to use a key different from the one provided
or might record all of the encryption keys in a special file for later
retrieval.
<p>2.4 <u>Elements of Encryption</u>
<p>There are many different ways that one can use a computer to encrypt
or decrypt information. Nevertheless, each of these so-called encryption
systems share common elements:
<p>2.4.1 <u>Encryption algorithm</u>
<p>The encryption algorithm is the function, usually with some mathematical
foundations, which performs the task of encrypting and decrypting the data.
<p>2.4.2 <u>Encryption keys</u>
<p>Encryption keys are used by the encryption algorithm to determine how
data is encrypted or decrypted. Encryption keys are similar to computer
passwords: when a piece of information is encrypted, one needs to specify
the correct key to access it again.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But unlike a password program, an encryption programme doesn’t compare
the key one provides with the key one originally used to encrypt the file,
and grant access if the two keys match. Instead, an encryption program
uses key to transform the ciphertext back into the plaintext. If one provides
the correct key, one gets back his original message. If one tries to decrypt
a file with the wrong key, one gets irrelevant and unreadable message.
<p>2.4.3 <u>Key length </u>As with passwords, encryption keys have a predetermined
length. Longer keys are more difficult for an attacker to guess than shorter
ones because there are larger permutation and combination of keys for them
to try. Different encryption systems have keys of different lengths; some
of which may have variable-length keys.
<p>2.4.4 <u>Plaintext</u> The information which one wishes to encrypt.
<p>2.4.5 <u>Ciphertext</u>The information after it is encrypted.
<p>2.4.6 <u>Message Digests </u>A message digest (also known as Cryptographic
check sum or Cryptographic hash code) is nothing more than a number - a
special number that is effectively a hash code produced by a function that
is difficult to reverse.
<p>2.4.7 <u>Digital Signature</u>
<p>A digital signature is a message digest encrypted with someone’s private
key to certify the contents. This process of encryption is called signing.
Digital signature can perform two different functions, both being important
to the security of the system :
<p>Integrity - A digital signature indicates whether a file or a message
has been modified.
<p>Authentication - A digital signature makes possible mathematically verifying
the name of the person who signed the message.
<p>A third function that is quite valuable in some context is called non-repudiation.
Non-repudiation means that after one has signed or sent a message, one
cannot take claim that he/she did not sign the original message. One cannot
repudiate his/her signature, because the message was signed with his/her
own private key (which, presumably, no one else has).
<p>2.5 <u>Cryptographic Algorithms</u>
<p>There are two basic kinds of encryption algorithms in use today :
<p>2.5.1 <u>Private key cryptography</u>, which uses the same key to encrypt
and decrypt the message. This type is also known as symmetric key cryptography.
Private key encryption is the method used in supplying personal identification
numbers and account information for credit card and automatic teller machine
transactions.
<p>The information is scrambled electronically when transmitted from the
bank to central computers, thus maintaining the security of the account
information.
<p>2.5.2 <u>Public key cryptography</u>, which uses a public key to encrypt
the message and a private key to decrypt it. The two keys are mathematically
related. The name public key comes from the fact that one can make the
encryption key public without compromising the secrecy of the message or
the decryption key.
<p>Public key systems are also known as asymmetric key cryptography. Under
this system, the parties on the Internet, for example, can encrypt messages
to one another using each other public keys and each can decrypt the other’s
message with his/her own private key. Public key encryption also allows
each message to bear a signature that cannot be forged.
<p>2.5.3 <u>Hybrid public/private cryptosystems</u>
<p>In these systems, public key cryptography is used to exchange a random
session key, which is then used as the basis of a private key algorithm.
(A session key is used only for a single encryption session and is then
discarded.) * Nearly all practical public key cryptography implementations
are actually hybrid systems.
<p>2.5.4 <u>Secret key</u> - A key that is kept secret, for decrypting
a message once they are received.
<p>2.5.5 <u>Key Escrow</u>
<p>Under Key Escrow, a copy of decryption key for each user is escrowed
(placing a copy of key in a secure location) by one or more trusted parties,
and is available if a warrant is issued for it. Concept of safe and safety
deposit box have been introduced in this context.
<p>2.5.6 <u>Key Splitting</u>* The concept of "Key Splitting" is used in
the approach to escrowing of keys. Under this, key is splitted into several
parts using appropriate algorithms and each part so splitted is deposited
with several trusted parts. For decryption all the splitted parts are to
be combined. With key-splitting schemes, one or two parts by themselves
are not enough to recreate the key, but a majority of them is enough to
recover the key.
<p>The issue of access to encrypted messages by law enforcement or intelligence
agencies raises some technical (as well as legal policy) questions. One
possible technical possibility is the use of split keys i.e. one party
has one part of the solution and a second party has the other part. Safety
deposit boxes are an example of physical split keys. A number of software
packages are available in the market which implements this concept.
<p>2.5.7 <u>Key Recovery</u>
<p>Cryptographers are now beginning to work on so-called "Key Recovery"
approaches as an alternative to key escrow systems. Under these systems,
no key is ever transferred to another party.
<p>To understand key recovery, it is better to think of a combination lock
on the front of the house. In this case, there is a series of digits -
say, a 6 - digit combination (instead of actual number) which the home
owner may give to his trusted party. Here again it is not necessary that
home owner must provide all 6 digits to the trusted party. He may apply
the key split approach and split the number and provide the splitted parts
to more than one trusted party.
<p>Under more advanced forms of key recovery, means are readily available
to ensure that in the first case, the 3-digits could be done randomly and
in no particular sequence. Therefore, a trusted party who has 3 digits
would not know in which sequence they would appear in the combination,
and neither would he necessarily know who the other trusted party are who
have the other 3-digits. Further even, protective shields of sorts to protect
the confidentiality of 3-digits have been provided.
<p>This would be similar to the home owner providing the 3-digits to each
of two trusted party in a sealed envelope. If the sealed envelope were
ever broken into, then it would be known that an unauthorised access attempt
has been made.
<p>In the world of cryptography, key recovery systems are much more complex.
There are large number of digits (instead of 6-digit in the above cited
illustration) that go into the construction of a key.
<p>Private key encryption has many advantages over public key encryption.
Lower computer overhead costs and quicker response time. With a sufficient
number of digits in the key, it becomes difficult to break.
<p>In one variant, the encryption and decryption is performed internally
by computers - on either end of a communication. All the user needs to
do is to hit a key or click on an icon to instruct the computer to encrypt
and transmit the message. An exchange of digital signatures between the
sending and receiving computers authenticate the exchange. The receiving
computer then decrypts the message. The public key/private key system operates
behind the scenes, so to speak, but neither the sender nor the receiver
is conscious of it.
<p>2.6 <u>Encryption Standard</u>
<p>One of the most widely used encryption system today is the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) developed in the 1970s and patented by researchers at IBM.
The DES was endorsed by US Govt. in 1977 for use within the US. Since 1977,
the system has been periodically reviewed and reaffirmed (most recently
in Dec, 1993), until 1998. It has also been adopted as an American National
Standard.
<p>The DES is basically a bit permutation, substitution, and a recombination
function performed on blocks of 64 bits of data and 56 bits of key (eight
7-bit characters). The 64 bits of input are permuted initially, and then
input to a function using static tables of permutations and substitutions.
The bits are permuted in combination with 48 bits of the key in each round.
This process is iterated 16 times (rounds), each time with a different
set of tables and different bits from the key. The algorithm then performs
a final permutation, and 64 bits of output are provided. The algorithm
is structured in such a way that changing any bit in the input has a major
effect on almost all of the output bits.
<p>The standard is heavily used in many financial and communication exchanges.
Many vendors make DES chips that can encode or decode information fast
enough to be used in data - encrypting modems or network interfaces.
<p>2.7 <u>Export Control</u>
<p>Cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are subject
to US Govt. export control as specified in Title 22, code of Federal Regulations,
parts 120 through 128.
<p>Some exports of cryptographic modules implementing DES standard and
technical data regarding them must comply with US Govt. regulations and
be licenced by the US Deptt. of State.
<p>Other exports of cryptographic modules implementing DES standard and
technical data regarding them fall under the licencing authority of the
Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Deptt. of Commerce.
<p>The Department of Commerce is responsible for licensing cryptographic
devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary software,
automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment
and software.
<p><a href="cryplaw.htm#index">Back to Index</a>
<p><a NAME="International Scenario"></a>3.0 <u>International Scenario</u>
<p>3.1 <u>G-7 Countries</u>
<p>The leading information technology associations in Canada, Europe, Japan
and United States have jointly identified data security and privacy as
one of the key principles on which the Global Information Infrastructure
(GII) must be built. They did so in a paper prepared in January 1995 for
a meeting of the Group of 7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, United Kingdom and United States). The cooperative associations
were the information technology associations of Canada, the European Association
of Business Machines and Information Technology Industry (EUROBIT), the
Japan Electronic Industry Development Association (JEIDA) and the Information
Technology Industry Council of the United States. The paper noted that
implementation of GII necessarily require use of Cryptographic technology.
The paper prepared by G-7 countries suggests the following :
<p>That governments, industry and users must agree on the cryptographic
techniques to be used in the Global Information Infrastructure and on a
procedure for verifying that products conform to the techniques so agreed.
<p>That the agreed techniques and the agreed verification procedures must
be made public.
<p>That the agreed techniques must be based on private sector-led, voluntary
consensus international standards.
<p>That products implementing the agreed techniques should not be subject
to import controls, restrictions on use within the law, or restrictive
licensing.
<p>That products implementing the agreed techniques should be exportable
to all countries, except those which are subject to UN embargo and
<p>That users and suppliers of products implementing the agreed techniques
should be free to make technical and economic choices about modes of implementation
and operation, including a choice between implementation in hardware or
software where relevant.
<p>3.2 <u>Information Infrastructure</u>
<p>In the United States, the office of Management and Budget established
a Privacy Working Group of the Information Infrastructure Task Force under
the Chairmanship of Secretary (Commerce). The Group published in June 1995
a set of principles for providing and using personal information. It called
on all the participants in the National Information Infrastructure (NII)
to be guided by three basic principles :
<p>i) Personal information should be acquired, disclosed and used only
in ways that respect an individual’s privacy;
<p>ii) Personal information should not be improperly altered or destroyed;
<p>iii) Personal information should be accurate, timely, complete and relevant
to the purpose for which it is provided and used.
<p>The Working Group have made detailed recommendations dealing with data
acquisition, notification, individual rights, data security and other subjects.
<p>3.3 <u>OECD Guidelines</u>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development comprising
of primarily industrialised countries, including Australia, Canada, Western
European Nations, Japan and United States adopted a set of guidelines for
cryptography policy. The guidelines are eight in numbers. In summary, they
call for :
<p>1. <u>Trust in Cryptographic Methods</u>
<p>Cryptographic methods should be trustworthy in order to generate confidence
in the use of information and communications systems.
<p>2. <u>Choice of Cryptographic Methods</u>
<p>Users should have a right to choose any cryptographic method, subject
to applicable law.
<p>3. <u>Market Driven Development of Cryptographic Methods</u>
<p>Cryptographic methods should be developed in response to the needs,
demands and responsibilities of individuals, businesses and governments.
<p>4. <u>Standards for Cryptographic Methods</u>
<p>Technical standards, criteria and protocols for cryptographic methods
should be developed and promulgated at the national and international level.
<p>5. <u>Protection of privacy and personal data</u>
<p>The fundamental rights of individuals to privacy, including secrecy
of communications and protection of personal data, should be respected
in national cryptography policies and in the implementation and use of
cryptographic methods.
<p>6. <u>Lawful Access</u>
<p>National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to plaintext,
or cryptographic keys, of encrypted data. These policies must respect the
other principles contained in the guidelines to the greatest extent possible.
<p>7. <u>Liability</u>
<p>Whether established by contract or legislation, the liability of individuals
and entities that offer cryptographic services or hold or access cryptographic
keys should be clearly stated.
<p>8. <u>International Cooperation</u>
<p>Governments should cooperate to coordinate cryptography policies. As
part of this effort, Government should remove, or avoid creating in the
name of cryptography policy, unjustified obstacles to trade.
<p>Although the guidelines vary in scope, most OECD members have adopted
these guidelines. These guidelines are to be reviewed at least every five
years with a view to improving international cooperation on issues relating
to cryptography policy.
<p><u>US Govt. Guidelines</u>
<p>US Govt. has developed a draft policy paper for global electronic commerce
"A framework for Global Electronic Commerce defining strategy to help accelerate
the growth of Global Commerce across the Internet". As a part of that strategy
paper, US Govt. has recently taken initiative to permit companies to export
encryption products using 56-Bit Data Encryption Standards (DES) or equal
algorithm for next two years provided such companies commit, build and
market products that protect public safety and national safety. No key
lengths or algorithm restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products.
Such key recovery products would enable Government access to encrypted
data collected during legally authorised criminal investigations. Domestic
use of key recovery will be voluntary; any American will remain free to
use any encryption system domestically.
<p>1. The United States will work within the OECD to develop international
guidelines that can guide OECD member governments as they develop national
encryption policies.
<p>2. These guidelines will support the ideas of key recovery, under which
the keys for encryption products would be stored within trusted entities,
either in government or the private sector, which would provide the keys
needed to decrypt encrypted information encountered during a law enforcement
investigation. Both the US and the EU are promoting this kind of approach
within their jurisdictions.
<p>3. The United States government, specifically, the Departments of Commerce,
Defence, Justice, State, and Treasury as well as the Executive Office of
the President, will work with the EU and the OECD over the next few years
to develop common policies for security and encryption which will provide
a more predictable and secure environment for electronic commerce.
<p>The Government, industry, consumer groups, civil liberty groups and
the media around the world feel that it is time to reform public policy
and cryptography and develop a global key recovery framework.
<p><a href="cryplaw.htm#index">Back to Index</a>
<p><a NAME="Scenario in country"></a>4.0 <u>Scenario in the country</u>
<p>The cryptography scenario in the country is in the development stage.
Few organisations particularly in the defence are engaged exclusively for
the development of cryptography techniques, protocols and the products.
Cryptographic products compatible with IBM PC have been developed and are
being used commercially. Apart from this, customised cryptographic products
have been designed and produced. The issue of public and private key normally
is considered by Joint Cipher Bureau.
<p>Department of Telecommunications does not permit the encrypted signal
on their network. This is one of the reasons that this area has not come
up well in the country. Secondly, the cryptographic products world wide
are licenced items and the licence to the country is not easily available
for products of higher key length and more than 56 bits. Indian industry
largely produces PCs and therefore the cryptographic product has been limited
to the PC market as the complete knowhow in this regard is not available.
The larger systems are not produced in the country and therefore the progress
of the work in this direction is slow as the knowhow of the system is generally
not available.
