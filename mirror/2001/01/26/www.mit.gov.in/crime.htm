<P>The rapid development of computer telecommunication and other technology
has led to the growth of new forms of transnational crime, especially computer
related crime. Computer-related crime has virtually no boundaries and does
or may affect every country in this world.
<BR>The report seeks to be a working document, discusses the phenomenon
of computer-related crime, nature and classification of computer related
crime. The report summarises the work done in the area of computer-related
crime internationally, the acts/amendments enacted by several countries
and discusses the need for promotional programme to create the awareness
and enactment of necessary legislation in the country for the prevention
of computer related crime. The report also identifies other source of information
to which any one interested may refer to obtain detailed information.
<BR>Given the complex and volatile world of computers and telecom, even
though this report presents a grim and ominous view of the field, the reality
of being better safe than sorry has to be realised.

Introduction</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Information technology today is encompassing all walks of life all over
the world. The technological developments in the concept of computing,
network and software engineering have helped in transition from paper to
paperless transactions and Bi-media (text and data) to multimedia . Today,
speed, efficiency, and accuracy in information exchange have become key
tools for boosting innovations, creativity and increasing productivity.
Activities as diverse as banking, healthcare, education, manufacturing,
retailing, entertainment and mass media have come to depend on the ability
to generate, access, store and transmit information. Computers are not
only used extensively to perform the industrial and economic functions
of society but are also used to perform many functions upon which human
life is dependent. Medical treatment, air traffic control, industrial contolled
and national security are few examples. Even a small glitch in the operation
of the systems can put human lives in danger. Computers are also used to
store confidential data of a political, social, economic or personal nature.
Society’s dependence on computer systems, therefore, has a profound human
dependence.
<UL>
<LI>
The new technology has brought a great deal of benefits to Govt., business
and research &amp; development and to citizen himself. Its positive impact
should not be measured only in terms of time and money.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The ever-expanding world of information technology has, however, a different
side. Computer systems offer some new and highly sophisticated opportunities
for law breaking and the potential to commit traditional types of crimes
in non-traditional ways.</LI>

<BR>Today, large processing and storage capacity is available on desktop
systems both at the level of main system memory RAM (Random Access Memory)
as well as secondary level (Hard Disc). The Central Processing Unit can
process millions of instructions per second. Large data and computer files
can be stored and manipulated in any desired manner. These systems can
be networked and logged into any other system anywhere in the globe to
access data, programme or data file.
<DIR>
<LI>
Dataquest USA reported recently that an estimated 82 million computers
worldwide will be linked to the Internet by the end of 1998 - up an astounding
71 per cent in just one year. It further predicts that the figure will
triple to 268 million in the next four years.</LI>

<LI>
The trans-national expansion of large scale computer networks and the ability
to manipulate content including images from remote login and access to
systems through regular telephone lines increases the vulnerability of
these systems and the opportunity for misuse or criminal activity. The
potential extent of computer crime is as broad as the extent of the international
communication system. The consequence of computer crime may, therefore,
have serious economic impact on social as well as human fabric of the society.</LI>

Laws, criminal justice systems and international cooperation have not kept
pace with technological changes. Only a few countries in Western Europe
and Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) have
drafted laws to address the problem. However, none of the countries has
resolved all the issues concerning legal, enforcement and prevention of
problems arising out of technological change.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Computer crime is a new form of trans-national crime and its effective
addressing requires concerted international cooperation. This can only
happen, however, if there is a common framework for understanding what
the problem is and what solution there may be.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
It is predicted that within the next decade, it will be necessary for developing
nations to experience significant technological growth in order to become
economically self-sufficient and more competitive in world market.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
We have also made out plan to set up National Information Infrastructure
(NII) in the country. The use of Internet in the country is growing and
it is expected that there will be about two million Internet users in the
country by the turn of the century.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
A beginning has also been made in the use Electronic Commerce (EC) and
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) by number of agencies in the country.
The EC and EDI would involve communication of information pertaining to
trade, finance and would result in transaction between private and public
sector, in both domestic and international communities. It is expected
that by the turn of the century, there will be significant growth in the
use of EDI both in the country and around the world. The success and growth
of EC and EDI, however, would depend upon how the issues concerning legal
(such as tampering with data, message etc.), security and performance of
hardware, software and communication are resolved. Therefore, as dependence
on computer technology grows in the country, it is important to plan for
security , examine the issues and promote crime prevention programmes on
a national level. Adequate laws in this regard need to be framed and enacted.</LI>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
There has been a great deal of debate amongst experts on just what constitutes
a computer crime or computer data crime. One of the experts has defined
computer crime as -</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>"Any illegal action in which a computer is a tool or object of the
crime; in other words, any crime, the means or purpose of which is to influence
the function of computer."</DIR>
</DIR>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Another expert has defined computer offence as -</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>"Any incident associated with computer technology in which a victim
suffered or could have suffered loss and a perpetrator, by intention, made
or could have made a gain."</DIR>
</DIR>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
OECD however, has adopted the following definition as working definition
for computer - related crime or computer crime</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>"Computer abuse is considered as any illegal, unethical or unauthorised
behaviour relating to the automatic processing and transmission of data".</DIR>
</DIR>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
The OECD expert group has suggested functional classification that enumerated
activities that should be subject to criminal sanction. Council of Europe
in its report prepared in 1990, stated that the definition suggested by
OECD experts has a disadvantage in that it also includes unethical and
unauthorised behaviour, even such behaviour may not be a criminal offence,
however reproacheable it may be. This definition also seems to exclude
unauthorised use of computers and at the same time it may include several
traditional offences which are not necessarily computer related offences
in the narrower sense.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Council of Europe did not attempt a formal definition of computer crime
but left it to member countries to adopt functional classification as suggested
by OECD, to their particular legal systems and historical traditions. A
global definition of computer crime, however, has not been achieved: rather
functional definitions have been adopted.</LI>

Extent of Crime and losses involved - worldwide</FONT></FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>
Opinions on the extent of computer crime differ widely. Media reports on
spectacular cases and estimates of undetected ones, suggest a large amount
of offences with high financial losses. Computer crime is largely a phenomenon
reported in the industrialised countries particularly in USA and Western
countries. However, the cases are also increasingly being reported from
other parts of the world.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
United States is having world’s largest installed base of computers and
also have largest Internet users, it is the scene of most computer crime.
According to US Justice Deptt. even the most conservative estimates suggest
that both the number of incidents and dollar losses are staggering. As
per their estimates reported in media, computer crime account as much as
loss of US$ 10 billion a year in the United State alone.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
In the United Kingdom, the British Banking Association has estimated the
cost of computer crime at US$ 8 billion a year. According to a study conducted
by European Commission (EEC),investigations in Germany, few years ago,
indicated losses from computer manipulation between 15,00,000 and 20,00,000
DM, which in some cases were even higher in the following years. In Sweden,
the above mentioned study revealed an average amount of about 10,00,000
SEK for computer related embezzlement. This amount does not include the
cost of computer espionage, which cannot be easily measured in dollars.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The White House Office of Science and Technology (as reported by Los Angeles
Times Syndicate, Asia Features) has estimated overall losses to US businesses
from foreign economic espionage at nearly US$ 100 billion a year.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
EEC study showed that in Germany 4112 cases of computer crimes were reported
to the police during 1995. About 60 per cent of these cases were considered
by the Police to be case of computer crime under Penal Code. In Sweden
a total of 452 cases were reported pertaining to computer related embezzlements.
Austria reported 67 relevant cases until the end of 1995. France reported
1500 computer crime cases which were considered to be "intentional" and
929 cases were reported by Japan. In a survey in 1994, conducted by an
agency of UK Government, 21% of the 385 firms covered stated that they
had been victims of computer fraud in the course of past five years.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
A Computer Security Institution in USA, in a survey of 326 companies, financial
institutions and Govt. agencies, found that 75 per cent reported large
monetary losses, but only 17 per cent of computer crimes were reported
to law enforcement agencies. In another survey of 428 information specialists
with Fortune 500 Companies, the Computer Security Institution found that
only 42 per cent of these reported unauthorised penetration.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Most of the computer crime cases reported or verifiable pertains to falsification
of data, misuse of automatic cash dispensers, data alteration, data espionage
and unauthorised access to computer.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Majority of the cases, however, pertains to those reported by banks, financial
institutions and insurance companies. Input manipulation, that is, feeding
the computer with incorrect data and, to a lesser extent, by programme
manipulation and other interferences have been generally the modus operandi
identified in most of the computer related crime. However, the number of
verifiable computer crime, apart from cases of illegal programme copying
and the misuse of automatic cash dispenses is not very high.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Difficulties of detection and evidence, together with a lack of knowledge
on the part of investigating authorities in the computer data processing
and telecommunication sector, are one reason for such low number of verifiable
computer crime cases. Another, and may be more important one, is the reluctance
of victims (for example banks, insurance companies and other financial
organisations) to report incidents or divulge any related information due
mainly to a fear of losing goodwill through adverse publicity.</LI>

Perpetrators of Computer Crime</FONT></FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>
Computer crime is committed by broad range of persons; students, amateurs
and members of organised crime groups. The individual who accesses a computer
system without criminal intent is much different from the employee of a
financial institution who skims funds from customer account. The typical
skill level of a computer criminal is a topic of debate.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
As per the study conducted in Canada and European Union, some claim that
skill level is not an indicator of a computer criminal, while others claim
that potential computer criminals are bright, eager, highly motivated subjects
willing to accept a technological challenge, characteristics that are also
highly desirable in an employee in the data processing field.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
It is generally believed that those cases of intrusion by accident are
usually attributed to young computer whizz kids enthusiasts who enjoy a
challenge and have learned all the tricks including how to break into security
codes and keys. More serious crimes, entailing high financial damage, are
committed by technically accomplished persons with a university background
or advance technical training.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Computer criminal’s behaviour cuts across a wide spectrum of society, with
the age of offender ranging from 10 to 60 years and the skill level ranging
from novice to professional.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Any person of any age with a medium skill motivated by technical challenge,
by the potential for gain, notoriety or revenge or by promotion of ideological
beliefs is a potential computer criminal.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
A number of studies indicated that employees represent the largest threat
and indeed computer crime has often been referred to as an insider crime.
According to the international handbook on computer crime published by
New York, Wiley, 90% of the economic computer crimes are committed by the
victimised employees of the companies.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
As per the study conducted by Digital Corporation, USA, covering North
America and Europe, 73% of the risk to computer security was attributable
to internal sources and only 23% to external criminal activity.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
As the advances continue to be made in remote data processing and improved
telecommunication technology, the threat from external sources will probably
increase. With the increasing trend of networking of the system and usage
of more user-friendly software, the sociological profile of the computer
offender may change.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Owing to the greater complexity of certain computer routines and augmented
security measures, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that any one person
will possess all the information needed to use a computer system for criminal
purposes. Organised computer criminal groups, composed of members from
different sections of the society across different countries are beginning
to emerge.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The advent of viruses and similar mechanisms whereby computer software
can be made to act almost on its own initiative poses a new and significant
threat. Sophisticated viruses and devices such as "logic bombs" and "trojan
horses" can be targeted for specific objectives at specific industries
to commit a variety of traditional criminal offences from mere mischief
to extortion. These crimes, furthermore, can be committed immediately or
can be planted to spring at a future date. The current threat of the computer
crime and misuse is real. The future threat will be directly proportional
to the advances made in computer technology.</LI>

<P><A NAME="Vulnerability of Computer Systems to Crime"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#993300"><FONT SIZE=+1>5.
Vulnerability of Computer Systems to Crime</FONT></FONT></B>
<DIR>Computer systems are particularly vulnerable to computer crimes because
of a number of factors. The more significant of these are analysed below.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>i) Density of information and processes</FONT></B>

<P>Today the storage technology allows a storage of data to the extent
of few giga bytes on a desktop computer and large amount of data (terra
byte) on such system facilitating billions of characters on-line. Memory
management technique allows independent process to be supported con-currently
within a single operating system. The memory capacity on a personal computer
which was in the range of few mega bytes few years ago is in the range
of more than 100 MB on a desktop computer and can be expanded to as high
as 512 MB. The large disk capacity and the memory capacity facilitates
centralisation of large information and its processing. This provides an
attractive target for infiltrator for attacking functions or information
assets of an organisation as data files can be combined to produce new
information.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>ii) Open Connectivity</FONT></B>

<P>Today systems which are available in the market have an open operating
environment and open interfaces facilitating support for local, remote,
interactive and in real time user mode. Any system anywhere in the globe
can be connected both in terminal emulation mode or file transfer mode
to any other system in the globe. Internet is one of the classic example.
When information systems are implemented on such open systems, it is quite
possible that there are errors in software implementation which is fully
exploited by connecting the system and taking advantage of the system complexity.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>iii) Electronic Technology</FONT></B>

<P>Computer data can be incidentally changed or erased with minimum chances
of detection, e.g., virus or logic bomb. Anybody can easily modify the
files and then cover the evidence of the offence. Data can be duplicated
on floppies/tapes without any audit trails. By wire tapping, the computer
can be intercepted or false commands may be generated to change the data
and the files. Cases have been reported where electromagnetic radiations
emitted by the computer have been intercepted to capture the data, delete
or manipulate and program files without physically logging on to the system.
Moreover, all hardware is susceptible to failure through aging, physical
diameter and environmental change. These factors result in a problem of
reliability, environmental dependency and vulnerability to interference
and interception.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>iv) Human factors</FONT></B>

<P>Employees represent the greatest threat in terms of computer crime.
It is not uncommon in many EDP centres for computer programmers, computer
operator, hardware technicians and other staff members to have extraordinary
privilege in relation to access of key data and system resources in their
organisations. A consequence of this situation is the probability that
such individuals are frequently exposed to temptation.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>v) System accessibility</FONT></B>

<P>Most of the time it is a goal to provide the maximum computer accessibility
to large number of users. Two kind of computer crime that exploit remote
access are use of fraudulent identification and access codes to access
the system resources and the unauthorised use of an unattended terminal,
logged on by an authorised person. Unrestricted access privileges are often
granted rather than allowing only the privileges necessary to perform an
intended function. For example, a transaction oriented system permitting
read only or inquiry only access offers a greater degree of protection
than a system offering full programming capability. The exposure provided
through increasingly easy access to electronic data and system resources
is an important contributor to the vulnerability of modern computer systems.

in general and drafted recommendation No. R(81)12 on economic crime. This
recommendation was adopted by Committee of Ministers of Council of Europe
in June 1981. It defines economic crime offences by enumeration.</DIR>

In 1983, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) undertook
a study of the possibility of an international application and harmonisation
of criminal laws to address the problems of computer crime. It published
Computer - Related Crime : Analysis of Legal Policy in 1986. The report
surveyed the existing laws and proposal for reform in a number of Member
States and recommended a minimum list of nature of computer crimes that
countries should consider prohibiting and penalising by laws, for example,
computer fraud, and forgery, the alteration of computer programs data,
copyright interception of communications or other functions of computer
or telecommunication system. The National Commission on Crime of several
countries like Netherlands, England, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,
France etc. have also prepared reports on economic crimes which discussed
computer-related crimes.</LI>

Following the completion of OECD report, the Council of Europe, initiated
its own study on computer related crime with a view to developing guidelines
to assist legislators in determining the nature of computer related crime
should be prohibited by that law. The minimum list of offences defined
by OECD was expanded considerably by adding other types of computer misuse.
Procedural issues such as international search and seizure of data banks
and international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of computer
crime were also examined. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of
Europe adopted recommendations on computer related crime in Sept. 1989.</LI>

The issue of prevention of Computer - related crime was discussed in a
report entitled "Proposals for concerted international action against forms
of crime identified in the Milan Plan of Action" prepared by United Nations
in 1987. At the 12th plenary meeting of the Eighth UN Congress on prevention
crime, which took place in 1990, the representative of Canada introduced
a draft resolution on computer - related crime. At its 13th plenary meeting,
UN Congress adopted the resolution, in which it, inter-alia, called upon
the Member States to intensify their efforts to combat computer crimes
by considering, if necessary, the following measures :</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>a) Modernisation of national criminal laws and procedures, including
measures to :

<P>&nbsp; i) Ensure that existing offences and laws concerning investigative
powers and admissibility of evidence in judicial proceedings adequately
apply and, if necessary, make appropriate changes;

<P>&nbsp; ii) In the absence of laws that adequately apply, create offences
and investigative and evidentiary procedures, where necessary, to deal
with this novel and sophisticated form of criminal activity;

<P>&nbsp; iii) Provide for the forfeiture or restriction of illegally acquired
assets resulting from the commission of computer - related crimes;

<P>b) Improvement of computer security and prevention measures, taking
into account the problems related to the protection of privacy, the respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms and any regulatory mechanisms
pertaining to computer usage;

<P>c) Adoption of measures to sensitize the public, the judiciary and law
enforcement agencies to the problem and the importance of preventing computer-related
crimes;

<P>d) Adoption of adequate training measures for judges, officials and
agencies responsible for the prevention, investigation, prosecution and
adjudication of economic and computer-related crimes;

<P>e) Elaboration, in collaboration with interested organisations, of rules
of ethics in the use of computers and the teaching of these rules as part
of the curriculum and training in informatics;

<P>f) Adoption of policies for the victims of computer-related crimes which
are consistent with the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles
of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, including the restitution
of illegally obtained assets, and measures to encourage victims to report
such crimes to the appropriate authorities."</DIR>

Computer - Crime Legislation Worldwide</FONT></B>
<DIR>To meet the challenge posed by new kinds of crime made possible by
computer technology including telecommunication, many of the countries,
largely industrialised and some of those which are moving towards industrialisation
have in the past ten years reviewed their respective domestic criminal
laws from the point of adaptation, further development and supplementation
so as to prevent computer related crime. A number of countries have already
introduced more or less extensive amendments by adding new statutes in
their substantive criminal law. These are USA, Austria, Denmark, France
Germany, Greece, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia,
Canada and Japan. United States have made numerous amendments to the law
of federal and constituent level. Countries like Spain, Portugal, UK, Malaysia
and Singapore have made isolated supplements by enacting new Acts to prevent
computer - related crimes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>6.3</FONT></B> Computer related crimes and punishment
for committing such offences covered in the Computer Crime Act/Amendments/Supplementation
in the domestic laws enacted by different countries in the world are summarised
in the table attached. None of the country has fully resolved all the issues
such as legal, enforcement and prevention of crime. The legislation/amendments
enacted by different countries covers only few of the classified computer-related
crime/offences.
<DIR>&nbsp;</DIR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>6.4</B> </FONT>The punishment ranges imprisonment upto
one year to upto 10 years depending upon the offence. Unauthorised access
to computer/data/program has been classified as computer crime/offence
by almost all the countries who have enacted new act or modified the existing
domestic criminal laws. Heavy punishment along with fine have been imposed
for some of the offences like unauthorised use of computer, alteration
of data/program interfaced with computer etc.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>6.6</FONT></B> One of the reasons for not covering all
the computer related crimes as classified by OECD in the Acts by the various
countries is that the investigation of computer crime as well as general
investigations in a computerised environment create new computer specific
problems such as evidence, testifying witnesses, legality of gathering,
storing and linking personal data. In most of the computer crime cases
it is still unclear as to what is an effective investigation to verify
the different computer related crimes/offences. It is also unclear as to
what extent civil liberties of citizens must be protected against the storage
of personal data in police files by law. In addition, there are specific
legal problems related to admissibility of computer data in a trial process.
The laws so far enacted also do not clarify the jurisdiction. Such issues,
it is hoped, will serve as a basis for future work on computer related
crime and once resolved will help establish an adequate criminal system
in the data processing area.</DIR>

Computer related crime in India</FONT></FONT></B>

<DIR>The subject of computer related crime is comparatively new in the
country. The computerisation in the country though started 25 years ago,
the proliferation and penetration of computers in the country particularly
in the service sector is still very low as compared to world standard.
The density of personal computers in the country is only 1.8 per 1000 persons
as against world average of 25 per 1000 persons. As per the IDC report,
today only 40 per cent of the computers in the country are connected on
LAN.</DIR>

<DIR>The situation in regard to usage of computers in the country is changing
fast and it is expected that penetration of computers in the country will
reach 10 per 1000 persons by the turn of the century. The Internet users
in the country are also expected to increase from present level of 80,000
Nos. to 2 lakhs Nos. The concept of Internet, Intranet and Extranet is
growing. Data processing and its component will be used as a tool in many
areas such as tax administration, stock market and capital investment.

Strategy for Prevention of Computer Crime</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<DIR>The subject of computer related crime in light of the proliferation
of the computer technology assumes greater importance. It is required to
develop strategies for the suppression of these computer offences. The
strategies may include the following :

<P>- Stipulating the offences which constitute computer crime.

<P>-Identify the domestic criminal law for possible amendments and supplementation
to meet the requirement of prevention of computer related crime.

<P>- Effective prosecution, inter alia, by possible adopting the existing
criminal procedure law and related provisions.

<P>- Improving international collaboration.

<P>The new enactment of laws should bear the imprint of close link and
direct reference to existing penal provisions.

<P>Considering the transformational nature of computer-related crime; it
is desireable to adapt the guidelines and classification suggested by OECD
with nessecary ammendment.
<BR>&nbsp;</DIR>
<A NAME="Issues concerning classification of Computer"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>7.3
Issues concerning classification of Computer Crime</FONT></B>
<DIR>The term computer misuse and abuse is also used frequently but they
have significantly different implications. Laws that relate to computer
crime would need to distinguish between accidental misuse of computer systems,
negligence and intended and unauthorised access to computer system amounting
to computer misuse or abuse. For example; employee who has received a password
from an employer without direction as to whether a particular database
can be accessed, is likely to be considered of guilty of a crime if he
or she accesses that database. However, this principle would not apply
to the same employee who steals a password from a colleague to access the
same database, knowing that his or her accessing the database is unauthorised;
this employee would be behaving in a criminal manner. Distinction, therefore,
may be made between what is unethical and what is illegal. The legal response
to the problem must be proportionate to the activity that is alleged. The
law in case of computer crime, therefore, should be employed and implemented
with restraint.
<BR>&nbsp;</DIR>
<A NAME="Security Guidelines/Manual"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>7.4 Security
Guidelines/Manual</FONT></B>
<DIR>In addition to use of laws as a preventive measure, it is necessary
to develop concepts/guidelines and manual for computer security and implement
the guidelines in a serious manner at all levels and within different types
of entities and organisations. Such guidelines/manual are fundamentally
important and hold greater prospects of success than to enact new laws
for protection. The guidelines/manual should detail out the procedures
and evolve self-regulating code of conduct or possible introduction of
an obligation on the part of the enterprise to provide, in their annual
accounts, information on the reliability of the data processing. While
preparing the guidelines/manual, historical traditions should be reviewed
and kept in mind.
<BR>&nbsp;</DIR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;<A NAME="Procedural Law"></A></FONT></B> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>7.5
Procedural Law</FONT></B>
<DIR>The guidelines and the procedures have to be evolved, for instance,
to the application of the provision on search and seizure to the access,
recording and storing new data, on wire tapping to the interception of
telecommunication. The opinion and adoption of the procedure for the investigation
of computer crime is almost essential and should necessarily follow any
enactment or new law or supplementation of existing law. The guidelines
should include such aspects as search of the premises, powers of seizure,
the duty of witnesses to hand-over witnesses as well as legality of gathering,
storing and linking personal data.

<A NAME="Conclusion"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#993300"><FONT SIZE=+1>8. Conclusion</FONT></FONT></B>
<DIR>
<DIR>The conclusion may, therefore, be drawn that computer-related crime
is a real, at least in respect of certain offences, expanding phenomenon,
even though some of the statistics are probably not reliable. Furthermore,
a steady increase in number of cases is expected. As of now the growth
rate in number of computer crime cases reported worldwide is in between
12-15 per cent. The time has clearly come for our country to put in hand
a series of preventive measures in the field of security or of instructions
in computer ethics, and to respond to this by forming appropriate guidelines
and legislation.
