<P><A NAME="sect1"></A>1. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>Information Technology and National
Information Infrastructure </FONT></U></P>

<P>Information and communication technologies are rapidly reshaping the
world. These technologies encompass the range of products and services
which supply and manipulate information. The speed with which new technologies
are created and disseminated into public life has increased and is only
getting faster.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The range of new technologies seems to be growing exponentially
as traditional forms of representing, manipulating and communicating information
are combined with each other and continually improved. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Over the next decade, whole population will find almost every
aspect of their daily life - their education, healthcare, work and leisure
activities - affected by advances on National Information Infrastructure
(NII). </P>

<P>&nbsp;With the exploding popularity of the Internet, it is almost a
requirement that a business have a presence on the Internet. The Internet
- and the technologies it has spawned - has made electronic commerce one
of the most effective and reliable methods for conducting business. </P>

<P>Today advertisements and sales brochures are proliferated among the
Web, news group and bulletin board. Cyber stores offer anything from music
CDs to certificates of deposits. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Internet today has a potential of making every computer an individual
printing press, library, museum, tour guide, shopping mall and bank. </P>

<P>&nbsp;According to recent report from Forrester Research, the overall
Internet economy will approach $ 200 billion in the year 2000, up from
$ 15 billion today. By the year 2000, many enterprises will be collaborating
internally on data - rich Intranets, and selling effectively with a new
breed of multimedia - rich, information - style electronic stores. </P>

<P>&nbsp; <A HREF="DigiLaw.htm#INDEX">Back to Index</A> </P>

<P><A NAME="sect2"></A>2. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>Technology Shift</FONT></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;The single most important change in technology leading us to the
National Information Infrastructure is the digitisation of the media and
network. This has resulted in both creation and capture of the interactive
age. All information including audio and video content can be used in any
order and can be rearranged at will. Digital content can also be transformed
for using other medium, e.g., from text to voice or vice a versa. There
is a conversion of computing communications and content technologies in
industries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;There is a shift towards client server computing for the dynamic
client/customer service organisation. Software is processed not only on
a host, but wherever it makes more sense. Software is not limited one machine
but can be processed co-operatively on various computers on the network.
In a client/server computing, software works on a client computer like
on desk top PC or server which can be located anywhere. The computer becomes
the network and the network becomes the computer. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Today Internet having a bandwidth in the range of few Gigabits
transporting mainly data and text. Eight years ago we were transmitting
the data and text at a speed of two pages per second. The new network will
transmit data and text at a speed of 12 Gigabits by the end of 2000 and
in the order of trillion bits by 2010. At that speed, the new_network may
transmit data and text at speed of 2 small public libraries per second.
There is a shift from separate data, text, voice and image to multimedia.
The two professionals in different parts of the globe can exchange (at
the speed of light computerised or digital documents tat contain data -
audio and video). This compound document can be filed electronically, retrieved,
altered and communicated as appropriate without ever being transformed
on to paper and like the piece of paper, one can take it on the subway.
Unlike the paper, it communicates with other documents and people as you
ride along. In that scenario there may be static media such as data, text
and still images, and there are time-bound media (including voice, sound
and video). </P>

<P>&nbsp;There is a technology shift from proprietary open system enabling
inter-operability on information system around the world so that one system
can call any other system. </P>

<P>&nbsp;There is a shift from dumb to intelligent networks. Until recently,
it was not only information appliances that were dumb - the computer that
carried information had no intelligence built into them. Today the situation
is different. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Today hyper media is letting us to walk through the net. We can
have hyper links to any other information on the net to any other computer
containing information. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Today the whole lot of rapidly deployable softwares are available
for rapidly changing world and situation will improve in the near future.
The direction is towards object computing. </P>

<P>&nbsp;With the digital revolution continuing and the Internet becoming
more popular with each passing day, cyberspace law has emerged as a separate
new area of specialisation. </P>

<P>&nbsp; <A HREF="digilaw.htm#INDEX">Back to Index</A> </P>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="sect3"></A>3. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>Legal Issues</FONT></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;The emerging information and communications network is likely
to have an important impact on economic development and world trade.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The users of information technology must have trust in the security
of information and communications infrastructures, networks and systems;
in the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data on them; and
in the ability to prove the origin and receipt of data.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The data is increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated threats to
its security, and ensuring the security of data through legal, procedural
and technical means is fundamentally important in order for national and
international information infrastructures to reach their full potential.</P>

<P>&nbsp;In general, &quot;Cyber law&quot; typically encompasses all the
cases, statutes, and constitutional provisions that impact persons and
institutions who control the entry to cyberspace, provide access to cyberspace,
create the hardware and software which enable people to access cyberspace,
or use their own computers to go &quot;on-line&quot; and enter cyberspace.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;Some of the key players in cyber law disputes may include phone
companies, regulatory agencies, personal computer companies, software companies,
Internet service providers, schools, colleges, universities, all persons
and companies that have established a presence on the Internet. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Currently, Cyber law is a wide-open area of law, with much uncharted
territory and many unresolved issues. </P>

<P>&nbsp; <A HREF="digilaw.htm#INDEX">Back to Index</A> </P>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="sect4"></A>4. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>Authentication of instructions</FONT></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;Our law is tuned to establish authenticity of a transaction through
signature. In the absence of paper, signature needs to be replaced. Legal
rules are required to define under what circumstances a person can be bound
in respect of an electronic instruction purported to have been issued by
him. Generally, authentication is achieved by what is known as security
procedure. Electronic devices like identification numbers, call-back procedures,
encyption are evolved to establish authenticity of an instruction. But
from a legal perspective, the security procedure requires to be recognised
by law as a substitute for signature.</P>

<P>&nbsp;New challenges arise in solving problems unique to electronic
authentication such as issues of data integrity, non-repudiation, evidentiary
standards, choice of technology, liability standards, contractual freedom,
consumer protection, and cross-border recognition of electronically signed
documents. </P>

<P>&nbsp;The basic characteristics and substantive aspects point at the
following issues for which law must provide for :</P>

<UL>
<UL>
<P>&nbsp;- Authentication of instruments</P>
</UL>
</UL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>- Countermanding or reversal of instructions</P>

<P><A HREF="digilaw.htm#INDEX">Back to Index</A> </P>

<P><A NAME="sect5"></A>5. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>Digital Signature</FONT></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;* A digital signature is a personalised thumbprint.</P>

<P>&nbsp;* It is the encryption of an electronic document by a key.</P>

<P>&nbsp;An early example of encryption was the use by a Roman emperor.
Every letter in a word was shifted 3 alphabets to the right.</P>

<P>&nbsp;As a paper is authenticated by an ink signature, a clean check
is identified by having the same handwriting and no scratch marks, in a
digital signature, every bit of the document has been signed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Applications include such as electronic banking, email, and general
security/authentication of documents.</P>

<P>&nbsp;It is the basic security concept for home commerce, and business
to business commerce. The Internet is insecure, VANs (Value Added Networks
in use for business to business commerce) are secure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The distinction between an electronic and digital signature is
an important one, the terms frequently are used interchangeably. For purposes
of consistent analysis here, &quot;electronic signature&quot; means any
identifiers such as letters, characters, or symbols, manifested by electronic
or similar means, executed or adopted by a party to a transaction with
an intent to authenticate a writing. A writing, therefore, is deemed to
be electronically signed if an electronic signature is logically associated
with such writing. </P>

<P>&nbsp;In contrast to an electronic signature, a &quot;digital signature&quot;
is an electronic identifier that utilizes an information security measure,
most commonly cryptography, to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and
nonrepudiation of the information to which it corresponds. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Digital Signature and Encryption is not a secret technology monopolised
by any one country. Any hobbyist can program a PC to do powerful encryption.
Many algorithms are well documented, some with source code available in
textbooks.</P>

<P><A HREF="digilaw.htm#INDEX">Back to Index</A> </P>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="sect6"></A>6. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>Categories of Digital
Signature</FONT></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;Most of the electronic and digital signature initiatives fall
into three categories:</P>

<P>&nbsp;- prescriptive, </P>

<P>- criteria-based, and</P>

<P>- signature enabling</P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>Prescriptive Approach</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;The prescriptive approach is a comprehensive effort that seeks
to enable and facilitate electronic commerce with the recognition of digital
signatures through a specific regulatory and statutory framework. It establishes
a detailed PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) licensing scheme (albeit voluntary),
allocates duties between contracting parties, prescribes liability standards,
and creates evidentiary presumptions and standards for signature or document
authentication. </P>

<P>&nbsp;On the whole, 18 states in USA have adopted or considered PKI-based
digital signature laws. Of these, 14 states have addressed digital signatures
alone while four states have considered giving effect to both electronic
and digital signatures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Thirty-one states have or are considering 58 statutes that address
electronic signature or electronic authentication standards. Fifty-five
of these initiatives representing 29 states may be divided between the
criteria-based and enabling categories.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Thirty-one states have or are considering 58 statutes that address
electronic signature or electronic authentication standards. </P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>Criteria-Based Approach</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;The predominant model for criteria-based laws is the &quot;California&quot;
authentication standard. The California criteria-based approach has proven
quite flexible for various state legislators. The broad criteria may apply
both to electronic and digital signatures since it is designed to lay the
requirements for trustworthiness and security. For example, the California
Secretary of State has recently published its Proposed Digital Signature
Regulations, in which it adopts two acceptable technologies: PKI digital
signatures and signature dynamics. Indiana has adopted the California criteria
as a prerequisite for the recognition of digital signatures. Illinois is
considering the criteria as a basis for evaluating whether an electronic
signature may be deemed &quot;secure.&quot; The first four elements of
the California standard also have been used in legislation from New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, and Virginia as optional criteria that the trier of fact
may consider when evaluating the authenticity of an electronic signature.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;On the whole, 11 states have 19 initiatives that incorporate the
criteria-based approach. Ten states have adopted the California standard
into law.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>Signature-Enabling Approach</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;The remaining legislative initiatives fall within the signature-enabling
category. The&quot;general&quot; laws permit any electronic mark that is
intended to authenticate a writing to satisfy a signature requirement.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;Massachusetts also is representative. Massachusetts has put forward
the most modest position regarding electronic authentication due to similar
concerns voiced in California regarding the potential for market distortions
and the need for technological neutrality. Massachusetts, however, does
not adopt any particular authentication criteria like California in removing
signature and writing barriers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>Electronic Records and Signatures</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement
is met by a record. In any legal proceeding, a record shall not be inadmissible
in evidence on the sole ground that it is an electronic record. Any duplicate
record that accurately reproduces the original record shall be admissible
in evidence as the original itself unless in the circumstances it would
be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement
is met by that person’s electronic signature. Where any rule of law requires
a signature to be notarized or acknowledged for filing, that rule is satisfied
by an electronic signature that meets standards established by the secretary
of the commonwealth. Subscribers have a duty of care (reasonableness) in
holding their private keys secure. CAs have a similar duty to use trustworthy
methods and may be bound by certain warranties.</P>

<P><A HREF="digilaw.htm#INDEX">Back to Index</A> </P>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="sect7"></A>7. <U><FONT SIZE=+1>International Scenario</FONT></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;Several countries have either planned or planning to enact laws
related to Digital Signature. The status is given below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>UNCITRAL </I></P>

<P>UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) is working
on a model digital signature law. The UNCITRAL Working Group on Electronic
Commerce met in February 1997.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>OECD (Organisation for Economic co-operation and Development)</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;On March 27, 1997, the OECD has in a recommendation adopted guidelines
concerning cryptography. The guidelines aim at promoting the use of cryptography,
e.g. for digital signatures, in order to advance the development of electronic
commerce.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The guidelines tackle the following subjects: trust in and choice
of cryptographic methods, privacy protection, lawful access to keys and
encrypted data, liability of persons and organisations that offer cryptographic
services, and international co-operation. As regards the lawful access
to keys and encrypted data, the guidelines distinguish between keys used
for confidentiality purposes and those used for digital signatures. The
latter may not be made available without the key holder’s consent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>United States of America</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;29 US States have enacted, proposed or drafted digital signature
legislation. The Utah Digital Signature Act of 1995 provides a legal framework
for the use of cryptography for authentication and integrity purposes.
Other states including Georgia, Florida, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and
Wyoming, have enacted similar bills. Massachutts has a draft legislation
that is more technology-neutral, covering both digital signatures and other
forms of electronic authentication. California and Arizona have passed
digital signatures legislation regarding electronic transactions with state
entities. California is also proposing a law to authorize use of digital
signatures and signature dynamics. Minnesota has established licensing
criteria for Certification Authorities and defined their legal responsibilities
to third parties. Nevada has enacted a law authorising the use of electronic
symbols as a substitute or supplement for certain signatures. </P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Arizona</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;1996 Arizona Session Laws 213. Arizona amended Section 41-121
of Arizona Revised Statutes on April 18, 1996 to provide limited use of
digital signatures. The amendment provides that the Secretary of State
shall &quot;approve for use by all other state agencies, and accept digital
signatures for documents filed with the office of the secretary of state&quot;
and gives the Secretary of State authority to adopt rules to achieve this
purpose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>California</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;California has adopted digital signature legislation significantly
narrower than that of Utah. It governs only digital signatures affixed
to communications with public entities. The Act provides that a digital
signature shall have the same force and effect as a manual signature if
: </P>

<P>(1) it is unique to the person using it; </P>

<P>(2) it is capable of verification;</P>

<P>(3) it is under the sole control of the person using it;</P>

<P>(4) it is linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed,
the digital signature is invalidated; and</P>

<P>(5) it conforms to regulations adopted by the Secretary of State.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Regulations. The Secretary of State has created a task force to
draft regulations and to study further expansion to the statute to the
private sector. The software industry is monitoring the task force with
great interest. Under the legislation the Secretary of State will license
certification authorities (CAs) only for state agencies and state employees
and for individuals who will be submitting digitally signed documents to
the State. CAs licensed by the State must publish all certificates as opposed
to using repositories. This could be an overhead cost problem that impedes
scaling up a digital signatures public key infrastructure (PKI). Language
in proposed regulations provides that California will accept certifications
from other agencies and other States, trying to leave it open for further
expansion. California enacted legislation permitting the use of an electronic
signature, or other indicator of authenticity, approved by the state registrar
in lieu of a manual signature on certificates of death by embalmers and
by persons attesting to the accuracy of the certificate. The act also authorizes
the use of such signature substitutes by local registrars in registering
certificates of death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Connecticut</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;General Statutes of Connecticut. Connecticut has promulgated legislation
directing the Commissioner of Public Health and Addiction Services to adopt
regulations for the use of electronic signatures for certain medical records.
The statute, however, does not make specific reference to digital signatures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Delaware</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;On July 12, 1996 Delaware enacted legislation to amend Title 29
of the Delaware Code, which relates to state budget, accounting and payroll
policies and procedures, to allow for the use of electronic signatures
with respect to documents created pursuant to Title 29. The bill broadens
the scope of the term &quot;signature&quot; as it applies to the signing
of checks or drafts by the state treasurer by dispensing with the requirement
that a check-signing machine be used if the check or draft is not signed
by hand. Furthermore, the bill authorizes the use of an &quot;electronic
approval&quot; by state officers in approving payment for services.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Florida</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;1996 Florida Senate Bill 942. This Bill creates the &quot;Electronic
Signature Act of 1996&quot;. It authorizes the Secretary of State to be
a certification authority to verify electronic signatures and requires
it to conduct a study of the use of electronic signatures for commercial
purposes. It has become law.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Hawaii</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;1995 Hawaii Senate Bill 2401. On June 17, 1996, Hawaii enacted
this Bill into law. This Bill provides that the state Judiciary shall convene
a task force in consultation with the Department of Commerce and Consumer
Affairs to explore a program for computer based digital and electronic
filing of court documents. The Judiciary and the Department of Commerce
and Consumer Affairs shall submit a joint report to the legislature on
an annual basis regarding the status and results of the program. A special
fund is created for implementation of the program. The Bill is to be repealed
on June 30, 2000.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Iowa</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;Iowa permits electronic signatures for voter registration forms
once &quot;the state voter registration commission shall prescribe by rule
the technological requirements for guaranteeing the security and integrity
of electronic signatures&quot;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Louisiana</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;Louisiana has adopted legislation similar to that of Connecticut
for electronic signatures. It provides for the use of &quot;alphanumeric
or similar codes, fingerprints, or other identifying methods&quot; for
medical records, subject to guidelines promulgated by the Department of
Health and Hospitals.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>New Mexico</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;On March 4, 1996 New Mexico enacted the Electronic Authentication
of Documents Act. The act describes as its purpose to &quot;provide a centralized,
public, electronic registry for authenticating electronic documents by
means of a public and private key system; promote commerce; and facilitate
electronic information and document transactions&quot;. An &quot;office
of electronic documentation&quot; is established under the secretary of
the state to maintain a register of public keys. The Secretary of State
is required to adopt regulations to accomplish the purposes of the act,
and may contract with a private, public or quasi-public organisation to
provide services under the act. The act took effect July 1, 1996.</P>

<P>&nbsp;New Mexico has three of four important elements in place : </P>

<P>(1) legislation regarding authentication for electronic signatures;
</P>

<P>(2) authority for standards to be approved by a Commission on Public
Records;</P>

<P>(3) Secretary of State as Officer of Electronic Documentation, is authorised
to establish procedures for registering public keys. Still to come is the
necessary appropriation legislation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Utah</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;The Utah Digital Signature Act. A copy of this Act and related
commentary can be found @ www.state.ut.us. This legislation was the first
to authorize commercial use of digital signatures. It governs the use of
public-private key pair encryption and certification authorises and was
designed to conform with various international and national standards that
are already in place. Certification authorises are to be licensed by the
Utah Department of Commerce. The legislation also protects the subscriber’s
private key as property, and therefore its theft or unauthorized use is
subject to criminal and civil liability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;1996 Utah Senate Bill 73. This Bill was signed by the Governor
March 8, 1996. It makes some minor technical amendments to Sections 46-3-103
and 46-3-301 of the Utah Digital Signature Act, above.</P>

<P>&nbsp;1996 Utah Senate Bill 188. This Bill was signed by the Governor
on March 12, 1996. It is the first set of substantial amendments to the
Utah Digital Signature Act. The Act is concerned with notarization and
authentication. It, among other things: defines certain terms; outlines
the role of the Division of Corporations and Commercial Code; provides
certification requirements, procedures, and duties; provides for performance
audits and investigations; outlines enforcement responsibilities; provides
for warranties and obligations of certification authorities; specifies
control of the private key; provides for suspension, revocation, and expiration
of certificates: gives recommended reliance limits and liability; provides
for collection on suitable guarantee; specifies signature requirements
and presumptions in adjudications; recognizes repositories and their liabilities;
and provides exemptions to auditing requirements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The Utah Digital Signature Agency has issued a request for proposal
(RFP) for an initial repository, from which Utah would issue certificates
to state agencies and individuals. Based on bids submitted it selected
a consortium of Novell, Zions Bank, Certco (Bankers Trust) and Exoterica,
Inc. The Agency has negotiated the contract. The repository is expected
to be up and running 6 months after signing the contract, but it might
take a year. Mike Wims, Assistant Attorney General is currently drafting
the Agency regulations required by the existing statutes. One of difficult
issues is the recognition of certification authorities (CAs) and repositories
outside of the jurisdiction. What should be the standards for foreign accreditation?
Fees need to be set by the State. Draft regulations should be available
for public comment under the Utah administrative procedure act, and will
be posted in the Utah website http://www.state.ut.us. The State needs to
increase the intensity of its regulation drafting effort to meet the goal
of being done before repository is up and running.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Virginia</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;1996 Virginia House Joint Resolution 195. This Bill relates to
digital signatures and issues related to electronic commerce. It establishes
a joint committee to study digital signature issues and to determine whether
Virginia should adopt legislation that would facilitate the development
of electronic commerce in Virginia. It passed the Senate on February 29,
1996, and the House concurred in the Senate amendments on March 4, 1996.
A copy of this Bill can be found @ www.state.va.us. More comprehensive
legislation House Bill 822 has been introduced dealing with &quot;Trade
and commerce; digital signatures,&quot; establishes a regulatory framework
for the use of digitized signatures, thereby enabling what is referred
to as electronic commerce. Such framework provides the basis by which individuals
and businesses can electronically authenticate business contracts and other
agreements exchanged over computer networks without the necessity of obtaining
pen-and-ink signatures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Washington</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;1996 Washington Senate Bill 6423. This Bill was signed by the
Governor on March 29, 1996. It creates the Washington Digital Signature
Act. It declares an intent to facilitate commerce by means of reliable
electronic messages, to minimize the incidence of forged digital signatures
and fraud in electronic commerce, to implement legally the general import
of relevant standards, and to establish in coordination with multiple states
uniform rules regarding the authentication and reliability of electronic
messages. The Washington bill is modeled after the Utah statute.</P>

<P>&nbsp;One difference between Washington and Utah is that although Washington
will licence Certification Authorities, Washington will not have a public
repository as in Utah. There is a high level of awareness and enthusiasm
for digital signatures in the State of Washington. The vote was unanimous
in the house, there was only one negative vote in Senate, and the Governor
signed the bill digitally.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<I>European Union</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;The European Commission has launched a call for tender for a Study
on the Legal Aspects of Digital Signatures, which is presently carried
out. The study will give an overview of national and EU policies, existing
and envisaged rules and regulations, as well as (de facto) practices concerning
digital signatures in the Member States and the EU’s main trading partners.</P>

<P>&nbsp;On July 3, 1997 a call for tenders in the Area of European Trusted
Services (ETS-II) was issued, which provides, amongst others, for a study
on promoting trust and user confidence concerning security services through
legal measures. The objective of this study will be the proposal of guidelines
for &quot;harmonisation of national legislation concerning the rules of
electronic documentary evidence and TTP liability&quot;.</P>
