    DoT special group for lifting ban on internet telephony <br>
    </b></font></a><font color="#000000">Hindustan Times 22.01.2001</font> </p>
    <p align="left">AFTER CONSIDERABLE debate, it now appears that he government is keen on
    legalising Internet telephony with an eye on ushering in a low cost alternative for
    domestic and international long distance calls in the country. <br>
    <br>
    A top government official told The Hindustan Times that &quot;the issue has been discussed
    at the highest level and an informal decision has been taken to explore the possibility of
    lifting the ban&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    As a result of these discussions, the department of telecom (DoT) has set up a special
    internal group headed by the deputy director general (regulation) for recommending a
    strategy to achieve this objective. <br>
    <br>
    The group is, however, faced with a complex task that involves assessing the entire
    telecom environment, addressing issues of financial viability of existing service
    providers like Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and
    suggesting an<br>
    appropriate regulatory and licensing mechanism for this kind of service. <br>
    <br>
    It is expected to make its formal recommendations to the Telecom Commission soon, which
    will then take a final view on the matter. <br>
    <br>
    The Group is also faced with another key issue relating to the present regime of separate
    licences for different telecom services like cellular, basic and Internet access. Sources
    said that it would try and find out an acceptable licensing regime for Internet telephony.
    <br>
    <br>
    Although other bodies including the Group of Ministers on Telecom and Information
    Technology (GoTiT) headed by finance minister Yashwant Sinha have listed this issue on
    their agenda in the past, no conclusive decision was taken. <br>
    <br>
    Sinha's group, while settling more than 100 policy and industry matters over the past one
    year had demurred from taking a final view on this matter. <br>
    <br>
    The entire policy establishment is in fact walking on a tight rope as opinion is sharply
    divided on the pros and cons of internet telephony. <br>
    <br>
    While on the one hand, a technology enthusiast like Chief Vigilance Commissioner N. Vittal
    is a vociferous supporter of this service, on the other, influential government and
    private telecom operators who have huge stakes in the long distance market remain
    sceptical. <br>
    <br>
    Surprisingly, SK Gupta, chairman of the blue-chip Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd, expresses
    quite a balanced view on this matter. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Although, my company shall definitely be affected, I am convinced that the march of
    technology cannot be stopped&quot;, he said and added that a low-cost service held
    tremendous opportunities for the masses. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;My personal view is that before a decision is taken on lifting the ban, we must cut
    call tariffs of conventional (circuit switched) telephony by at least 50 per cent from
    present levels. Without doing this, it may not be desirable to take this step&quot;, said
    Gupta. </p>

    <p align="left">The government may bring down the import duty on hardware computer
    components to nil in the Budget 2001-02. <br>
    <br>
    According to senior government officials, the ministry of information technology is
    expected to demand the reduction in its recommendations for the Union budget. <br>
    <br>
    Besides, the IT ministry is likely to demand a duty difference of 10 per cent between the
    finished goods and components in the budget <br>
    <br>
    'To develop the Indian IT market, we think that there is a requirement of 10 per cent duty
    difference between finished goods and components,&quot;said sources. <br>
    <br>
    Currently,basic customs duty on inputs of computer hardware industry varies from zero per
    cent to a peak of 35 per cent, and on finished goods&nbsp; the basic customs duty is
    uniform at 15 per cent. <br>
    <br>
    Information technology minister Pramod Mahajan is likely to meet the finance minister
    Yashwant Sinha to present the views of his ministry to the finance ministry on the Budget
    2001-02. <br>
    <br>
    It is also learnt that the IT minister will be meeting various infotech industry
    associations in the coming week. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The IT minister is meeting the finance minister to present the ministry's
    suggestions for the budget. Besides, the IT minster is also meeting various IT industry
    associations to gather their views,&quot; a senior IT ministry official said. <br>
    <br>
    The information technology ministry is also expected to recommend changes in EHTP scheme,
    so that the companies operating under this scheme will be under no export obligations. <br>
    <br>
    The IT ministry is also expected to demand simplifications of deemed export procedure by
    setting time limits for getting project authority certificate, special import licence and
    custom duty exemptions. <br>
    <br>
    Besides, the IT ministry is also expected to lobby for rationalisation of local levies. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Currently excise (14 per cent) and SAD (4 per cent) account for over one fifth of
    the price of IT products. The ministry has the opinion that this should be rationalised so
    that the cost of computers and IT products can come down,&quot; source said. </p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NEW DELHI, Jan 16 (UNI &amp; DHNS) Cisco Systems
    Inc. CEO John Chambers today said India needs an internet infrastructure to match its
    burgeoning software engineers. Cisco, world leaders in routers used for computer networks
    and power data traffic, is eyeing India as a prominent base for out sourcing.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr Chambers said top of the line engineers from
    India are cheaper to employ than their US counterparts. &quot;But it is the infrastructure
    costs that add to overheads,&quot; he said at an industry gathering here. But, India can
    emerge as the leading nation supplying network maintenance engineers to other nations, he
    said.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">India, which is poised for an economic leap, can
    catch up with its neighbor China in this field. &quot;Unlike China, India has a strong
    education system for software engineers,&quot; Mr. Chambers said. China now accounts for
    as much as five per cent of Cisco's business while India makes up only 33 per cent. Cisco
    predicts a worldwide shortage of two million networking professionals by 2005. It is also
    emphasizing a future where manufacturing design, learning, e-commerce, management
    information and customer support will be conducted over seamless networks of voice, video
    and data supported by integrated software solutions.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cisco, eyeing India as a key base, already has
    two software development centers in the country in addition to about 1,500 dedicated
    engineers working for Cisco in three Indian companies.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cisco announced last evening it will set up 34
    training academies in India to produce about 100,000 Internet network executives to make
    up for the expected professional shortage.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Wipro Corporation Chairman Azim Premji today
    called on Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers here and proposed to build a partnership with
    Cisco Systems so that Wipro could become the service provider partner of Cisco in the Asia
    Pacific region.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr Premji met with Mr Chambers, who is on a
    three-day India tour, along with president of Wipro Infotech Suresh Vaswani and A L Rao,
    president of Wipro Technology.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr Premji has also proposed new initiatives and
    technologies that both Cisco and Wipro could work upon together to strengthen their
    relationship.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Wipro Group has a six year relationship with
    Cisco with which it worked as a development partner in engineering functions. Wipro
    Infotech is the largest system integrator in the country for Cisco over the last five
    years and has contributed in the developmental activities of Ciscos global network too.
    For Cisco, Wipro Technologies works on high technology areas such as ATM, Frame relay,
    ISDN, voice over IPs and network management.</font></p>

    private sector in the higher education as a payback route to the nation.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The idea of allowing more and more private sector
    funded deemed universities was also discussed in the meeting. The growth of hardware

    addressed the convergence issue in 'limited' way, India could well be counted as one with
    a complete convergence law on its way.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sub group on convergence met more than 20
    times, while the GOM constituted in January last year met at 1'easta dozen times. As
    minister for information technology, Mr. Pramod Mahajan says:</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;There was no minister who did not raise
    objections and there was no part of the draft which was not debated on.&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While the GOM's nod to the draft Bill prepared by
    a sub-group headed by jurist Fali S Nariman, brings India one step closer to a clear
    framework for convergence, there is no indication of what will become of the ministries
    that are now exercising power over these sectors. This has always been dismissed as an
    'administrative' matter by the ministers concerned.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The draft by Mr. Nariman only envisages the
    setting up of the CCI which would be vested with the powers to grant licenses, manage
    spectrum, resolve disputes, as well as determine the conditions for fair, equitable and
    non-discriminatory access to network facility and service.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It would also have the powers as vested in a
    civil court under the Court of Civil Procedure, 1908.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Aiming to promote, develop and regulate the
    carriage and content of communications, the Bill would perforce repeal: The Indian
    Telegraph Act, 1885; The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933;</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Telegraph Wire Unlawful Possession Act, 1950; The
    Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995 and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of
    India Act, 1997.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After some rewriting, the draft comprising more
    than a 100 clauses will be put up on the Internet within a week but it is only at the end
    of the year that the Bill is presented to Parliament.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr.
    Mahajan said a period of 30 days would be given to allow the public to give its responses.
    The responses received will then be studied by the sub-group which. will get back to the
    Group of Ministers with any further recommendations, based on the suggestions received.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hence changes can be expected even at that stage.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus fine-tuned, the draft will then be referred
    to the Union Cabinet with whose approval it will make its way to the Parliament and later
    to the standing committee.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If everything goes clockwise and there are no
    undue delays at the various stages, Mr. Mahajan is optimistic that the Bill will be passed
    in the next Winter session.</font></p>

    India ready for e-governance<br>
    </a></b></font><font color="#000000">Business Standard 01.01.2001</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The declaration of the 2001 as the year of e-governance is a step in the
    right direction, 'so the quality of public services in india can be improved. The state
    government of Haryana too has set an ambitious target of electronic-governance by 2005.
    But the question is whether the declaration will turn out to be mere hype, or whether it
    can potentially change the relationship between government and governed.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">The Internet offers huge advantages for governance to turn around and
    create a special relationship with the people. It offers 24-hour service, seven days a
    week. It can transform the way public services are delivered.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Transactions with the government are rarely a matter of choice, but the
    challenge lies in making dealings with the government simpler, convenient and customer
    focused. The average government has over fifty different departments and agencies,
    organised vertically, which for the public, are quite cumbersome to deal with. Within a
    particular department, citizens have to move from desk to desk to get their work done, and
    they have no way of knowing the progress of the whole process. Can't we create a Dell
    Model on the Internet, where customers can track the delivery and performance of their
    work within the government?</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Internet portals, like consumer ones such as Yahoo, offer a one-stop
    shop for all that a citizen needs. Government portals can be designed to allow users to
    find out what they are looking for by asking simple questions such as 'How do I....?'. The
    citizens do not need to know about the complex organisational structure behind the scenes
    and the government workers processing the work. The portal lakes them wherever they want
    to go.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Services created on the Internet in other countries offer hope for a
    country like India. A Central government portal of this kind launched in Singapore has
    simplified the lives of ordinary citizens, Web sites like Nsman and MINDEF set up by the
    Ministry of Defense offer convenient services for a wide variety of applications, in
    knowing about the personal details of compulsory services in the armed forces.
    Internet-based procurement system launched under the umbrella site has saved the
    government millions of dollars on procurements. In an international survey of sites
    offering integrated service delivery through the Internet conducted last year by America's
    General Services administration, Singapore's e-citizen centre was found to be the most
    developed example of integrated service delivery in the world.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">There are other examples of on-line experiments in the US, the UK,
    Austria and Spain. Governments are now realising that it is time to improve the governance
    and refurbish their image. Citizens used to the Internet, in matters of e-commerce and web
    related services are asking questions as to why governments cannot make use of the web and
    deliver the same level of services.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">But what are the essential requirements for e-governance?</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">First, it requires a wide penetration and accessibility of the new
    technology. Internet services in India right now are available through personal computers
    alone. The US and Singapore, at over 60 per cent, are leading the world in Internet
    connections, and therefore experiments in e-governance have struck popularity among the
    users in these countries. The UK too, is not far behind with an Internet penetration rate
    of around 35 per cent Some of the Nordic countries like Sweden and Norway have a very high
    level of Internet connection, ranging between 50 to 70 per cent, and therefore apt to
    adopt e-governance. However, level of PC penetration in India is less than 1 per cent, and
    Internet connection is just 0.3 per cent'. The latter,-though, is expected to grow up to
    5.2 per cent by 2005.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">The other important dimension is the geographical spread of the
    net-savvy population, which is largely concentrated in metropolitan cities and among the
    more literate section of society. A country where 50 per cent of population is illiterate,
    the low level of the reach of technology will remain a huge barrier for promoting
    e-governance in the country An innovative approach is required for the benefits to
    percolate to the masses. Experiments through setting up cyber cafes, as has been done in
    many countries, for instance by Easy jet (Easy everything) in the UK, would, to some
    extent, promote Internet-usage among the people.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Cell phones and other wireless devices, such as PDAs, can also be used
    to access the Internet In two to three years' time, when broadband becomes a reality,
    these devices will become fully interactive and can be used for e-governance.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Planning for the long term would mean availability of services through
    multiple devices. The PC's growth has slowed down recently as computing power is giving
    way to expansion of services on the 'network of computers' through multiple devices. The
    success of' I-mode' services of NTT DoCoMo in Japan is a clear example of how commercial
    services have been exploited through the cell phone. We need to move fast to liberalise
    the telecom sector, to enable wider and faster reach of services.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">How e-ready are we ? In a study conducted by McConnell International,
    India has been ranked behind South Korea, Taiwan and China in factors such as
    connectivity, e-leadership, info-security, human capital and e-business climate.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">E-governance, not to be underestimated, creates a new platform which
    requires a paradigm shift in current thinking. The entire paraphernalia, culture and
    structure of the bureaucratic organisation, the hierarchy, the recruitment and promotion
    process, has to change. To operate a young technology, you need to put younger people in
    command, and in a flatter hierarchy Deep layers of bureaucracy are an antithesis to the
    philosophy of the Internet Nokia's experience in inventing attractive designs of cell
    phones, by putting younger people in the design team, is a good example. DoCoMo has
    repeated the same magic by promoting younger people in charge, where 'I-mode' services
    have caught on like wildfire among the younger Japanese. What a coincidence that the
    entertainment industry has put up a demand for a young chief at the Communication
    Commission of India, which will oversee convergence matters.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">There are a host of other issues such as investment in new technology by
    the government and tying up with banks and financial institutions to develop real-time
    e-commerce services which need to be addressed.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">And last but not the least, the ministry of information technology needs
    to be re-organised for the twenty first century, to take care of full benefits of
    e-governance. And without doubt, we need a very high level of commitment from the highest
    levels of decision makers so that e-governance does not end up a hype.</font></p>

    to push for IIT in every state<br>
    </b></font></a><font color="#000000">Economic Times 31.12.2001</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In an effort to create a quality IT personnel ¦ pool in India, the
    National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) is pushing for one Indian
    Institute of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institute of Information Technology (IDT) for
    every state in its pre-Budget proposals. &quot;We will also speak to the finance minister
    about identifying and upgrading 43 regional engineering colleges (RECs) to the level of
    IITs, if not in terms of complete infrastructure, at least in terms of basic facilities
    being provided Dewang Mehta, president Nasscom, told ET.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Nasscom placed these proposals before the ministry of human resources
    development as early as last March. By mid January 2001, Nasscom is also set to launch
    Operation Knowledge. &quot;As private industry we have worked out what the current
    requirements are to improve quality of IT education and training. And along with
    government resources, we want to pitch in our share,&quot; says Mehta. His reasoning is
    simple. &quot;Software will not grow in isolation and we also have programmes in basic
    education and healthcare lined up for 2001,' he adds. Recently, Nasscom's tele-medicine
    project, linking patients in remote areas of Lahaul-Spity districts of Himachal with a
    hospital in Shimla, has been very successful.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Mehta is not willing to place his bets on any one area as the 'hottest'
    in software for next year. &quot;But ecommerce, telecom and communications software for
    next generation Internet will see a lot of activity and growth,' he feels. Nasscom plans a
    seminar with Cisco chief John Chambers on what direction Indian IT companies should take
    when he is in Delhi on January 15.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Out of our 700 big IT exporters, 340 are into banking solutions
    and that is likely to emerge as another big growth area,' adds Mehta.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">In Web-enabled services, call centres and animation will be the sectors
    to watch in 2001. &quot;Animation software exports is likely to rake in $500 million,'
    stresses Mehta.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Nasscom isn't too perturbed by the slowdown in the US economy either.
    &quot;When there is a marginal slowdown, it increases outsourdng. And India could actually
    benefit from that. And in any case, at $4 billion exports last year, we are still too
    small to feel the impact,' he says. Nasscom puts the current year's software exports at
    $6.2 billion and targets $9.5 billion for next year. In the domestic market, e-governance,
    e-banking, e-commerce and e-procurement have been identified as new growth areas.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;The IT Act is in place and by February-March certification agendas
    should be in place. So, in the next financial year, e-commerce will take off with issues
    like digital signature being addressed Mehta hopes.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Every state is jumping on the e-governance bandwagon in some form.
    There are plans for e-judiciary, health, education,' says a confident Mehta. In fact, the
    new states of Uttaranchal and Jharkhand are working on their IT polices.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;We are in talks with Union power minister Suresh Prabhu for
    e-procurement in power plants. This will bring in more transparency at the technical
    level&quot; feels Mehta.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">Some of the issues that still need to be sorted out for software
    industry indude availability of domestic bandwidth and the early goahead for the National
    Internet Backbone. &quot;We will need statewide Net backbones connecting to form the
    national backbone,' says Mehta.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Availability of good quality power is also essential for the IT
    industry,' he stresses. In fact, according to Mehta, it is Bijli and bandwidth, which will
    get roti and kapda for our people.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><br>
    THE IT sector will have to wait for the promised relief in Section 10 A and 10 B of the
    Income-Tax act. Revenue department officials said that the changes would come about only
    in the budget session of Parliament and not in the winter session as promised. Industry
    had been gungho based on the promise made by the finance minister to industry on the
    sidelines of one of the IT conferences sometime ago that the winter session would see the
    introduction of these changes. Indications are that the revenue department would now be
    agreeable to making changes in the provisions affecting mergers and amalgamations.
    However, it would be unwilling to bring back the other incomes of IT companies under<br>
    the definition of export earning. <br>
    <br>
    Till the last budget, the IT Act did not differentiate between export earnings of IT
    companies from other incomes. Hence all the incomes of companies set up under the
    provisions of Section 10 A and 10 B were lax exempt. However, the last budget defined
    export earning and extended the tax cover available under the two sections only to export
    earnings. This had caused a furore, particularly from consultants, who represented the
    interests of companies which were earning substantial incomes from other incomes, who
    found that they had to henceforth pay a tax on these earnings. Revenue department
    officials said that the definitions introduced in the budget would remain, though it would
    be making changes to provisions which were hampering mergers and amalgamations. <br>
    <br>
    Industry has so far been objecting to the new insertion which would deny a unit tax cover
    under these sections, the second 51 per cent stake is transferred to a new owner. Industry
    and consultants have argued that this would hamper amalgamations and mergers. <br>
    <br>
    Officials point out that the new norms were inserted in the finance bill 2000, because at
    that time the government proposed to end exemptions under 10 A and 10 B from April 1,
    2000. However the need for this insertion has ceased to exist. The insertion was made to
    stop existing companies to extend their 10-year tax benefit through mergers. </p>

    <br>
    Union information technology minister Pramod Mahajan said on Sunday that a final review by
    the government on the proposed replacement to the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, with a
    Convergence Act would be undertaken on December 21. <br>
    <br>
    The draft Bill, after its examination by the group of ministers on convergence, would then
    be made available on the government website from December 25 to invite suggestions and
    comments. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;With this, India will be the second country in the world after Malaysia to have a
    Convergence Act,&quot; Mahajan said while addressing the valedictory function of the
    two-Day conference on Information Technology and Biotechnology here. Mahajan's
    announcement is significant as the proposed Bill promises to mark a major step towards<br>
    revolutionising telecommunications in India. The Bill and eventually the Convergence Act
    is expected to lead to the repeal of a large number of legislations such as the Indian
    Telegraph Act, 1885, the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. the Telegraph Wire Unlawful
    Possession Act, 1950, the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, and the
    Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997. <br>
    <br>
    He reiterated the government's commitment to push for the greatest possible growth in
    Information Technology through attractive policy measures and a liberalised environment.
    &quot;India's future truly lies in IT and biotechnology,&quot; Mahajan said while
    recalling Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's assertion that &quot;IT was India's
    tomorrow&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Mahajan emphasised that innovation, growth and development by Indians in IT and
    biotechnology would help create &quot;enormous wealth&quot; for the people. &quot;We can
    change the lives of one billion people through the creation of wealth through IT and
    biotechnology,&quot; he said. He said that he considered innovations and development in
    biotechnology as far more important than IT as it had the potential to bring prosperity to
    &quot;Bharat&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Mahajan lauded the efforts of Congress Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi in organising the
    &quot;e-merging technologies&quot; conference to promote Pune as an IT/Biotechnology
    destination. <br>
    <br>
    Kalmadi said that the Pune Vyaspeeth forum would organise a much bigger event in December
    2001 to promote the city as an ideal IT/biotechnology destination in India. &quot;We hope
    that the Union and state governments will back this project to make Pune a prominent<br>
    IT/biotechnology centre.&quot; </p>

    <p align="center">Information technology minister Pramod Mahajan today said that the
    government would accord the highest priority to the hardware sector in the year 2001-02 as
    part of the strategy to build a worldclass hardware industry in India. <br>
    <br>
    Inaugurating the IT World 2000/Comdex India here, Mahajan said, &quot;Next year, we are
    concentrating on the hardware sector to reduce the mismatch with the software sector. This
    is needed to make India a true global player in the IT sector.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    He said that government would come out with a slew of policy reforms that will help boost
    the hardware sector in India. He however did not specify details. <br>
    <br>
    'Today, India has become a colony for developed nations to tap software talent. We must
    grow from this. Developing a healthy hardware sector is a key to it. The IT ministry's
    efforts next year will be towards this,&quot; Mahajan said. <br>
    <br>
    He also proposed setting up of 10,000 community information centres in villages across the
    nation so that IT would percolate to the masses.<br>
    &quot;This is a proposal we are considering. We will seek the help of World Bank to
    implement this project,&quot; the IT minister said. <br>
    <br>
    Giving details of the Operation Knowledge project, which the government has drawn up to
    increase the availability of IT manpower in India, he said. &quot;We have prepared a
    blueprint which envisages doubling of intake in engineering colleges from the next year
    and then tripling it from the year after. By the year 2005, India will be a reservoir of
    IT manpower.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    India has also sought the help of the World Bank in implementing the Operation Knowledge
    project Mahajan also suggested greater cooperation between the old and new economy
    companies to popularise IT among the masses. <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, Dewang Mehta, Nasscom president said, &quot;Nasscom is undertaking a series of
    initiatives to help make the Indian police and judicial system more adaptable to IT and
    the new rules and regulations of the IT Act We will be conducting a series of workshops in
    association with state governments for officials in the judiciary and police. This will
    help the officials be better equipped with the legal implications in the digital
    era.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Mehta also called upon the government to take initiatives to improve the infrastructure
    facility in India. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Power conditions in India E so bad that 70 per cent of software companies in India
    have their own captive power stations. One of the main reasons why the hardware industry
    is not improving in India is the lack of quality power.&quot; Mehta said. <br>
    <br>
    Nasscom has also demanded improvement of the physical infrastructure in India. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need the Airport and road infrastructure in India to improve. So that the
    industry overall would benefit from it,&quot; he said. </p>

    <p align="center">VOICE-ENABLING the Internet is a critical factor for e-businesses to
    succeed in India, according to Mr Daniel Louppe, Director of Marketing, Internet
    Communication and Data Centre Group of Intel Corporation. <br>
    <br>
    Delivering the keynote address at the IT World 2000 Comdex India, Mr Louppe said that
    voice-enabling the Internet is the surefire method to ensure that there are no barriers
    created among the diverse communities in India. <br>
    <br>
    He said that Intel was working towards creating voice- enabled Internet in India by
    building necessary technologies. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Internet must address the needs of a larger section of people and voice-enabling
    it is a must,&quot; Mr Louppe said. <br>
    <br>
    He also said that the other crucial issues confronting the growth of the Internet in India
    would be the high cost, availability of skilled manpower and lack of standardisation in
    the Internet space. <br>
    <br>
    Also, the high import duty structure prevailing in the country &#151; around 40 per cent
    &#151; is a major stumbling block in acquiring new technologies and could emerge as a
    slowdown factor.&quot;The Indian business leaders should set for themselves the goals of
    accelerating the<br>
    adoption of the Internet, investing in IT and telecom infrastructure and rapidly
    implementing e-busi-nesses.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    On Intel's experiments with the Internet, Mr Louppe said that 95 per cent of the chip
    giant's business transactions are over the Net. In India, it is 100 per cent.&quot;Today,
    we manage 18,000 personalised sites over the Internet, which otherwise would have required
    deploying at least 6,000 employees.&quot; , <br>
    <br>
    Mr Louppe said that going by the current figures of 400 million personal computers and 350
    million regular Internet users, it was safe to assume that there would be one billion
    Internet users in the world by 2005. </p>

    opportunities. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;India is now a recognised player in the information technology (IT) sector. We plan

    Indo-Taiwanese bilateral trade, Mr Lu continued, is estimated to be around $1 billion.

    <p align="center">The Union government will soon put public sector undertaking CMC and
    other premier organisations under the ministry of information technology for divestment. <br>
    <br>
    This includes National Informatics Centre, Software Technology Parks of India, C-DAC and
    Semi-conductor Complex. <br>
    <br>
    The ministry of information technology , which is barely a year old, has dedded to turn
    itself into a lean, mean policy-making body, according to infotech minister Pramod
    Mahajan. <br>
    <br>
    Speaking at a private party organised to felicitate him upon completion of one year as the
    infotech minister, Mahajan said, ' Though these are our flagships, I am planning to get
    rid of them as there is no point having so many sodeties under the ministry.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    While Mahajan's announcement raised a lot of eyebrows, particularly those of the heads of
    some of these organisations who were present at the function, it was at the same time
    cheered by the private industry hon-chos. <br>
    <br>
    The dedsion of the ministry, however, seems as surprising as it is illogical since barely
    two months ago, the minister had said that the government's plan to divest its stake in
    CMC from 80 per cent to 51 per cent, which had been okayed earlier by the Union Cabinet,
    had been put on a hold due to unfavourable market conditions. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why should we sell stake in our blue chip companies and sell them for a song,&quot;
    Mahajan had then said. However, the minister said this time that since he was considered a
    reformist, he was keen to sell these. bodies and restrict the role of the ministry of
    information technology to a dedsion-making body.<br>
    <br>
    What surprised some industry observers was also the fact that when the ministry was formed
    a year ago, the government had carved out National Informatics Centre from the Planning
    Commission to bring it under the ministry of information technology umbrella. <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, the ministry has secured a commitment from the World Bank chief, who recently
    visited India, that IFC will fund at least 20 per cent of the expansion activity the
    government plans to undertake under its 'Operation Knowledge'. <br>
    <br>
    The plan, Mahajan said, was ready and would be announced soon. Under the blueprint,
    ministry of information technology planned to treble the output of FT professionals in
    India by 2005. At least 20 per cent of this would be funded by the World Bank, said
    Mahajan. ' </p>

    <p align="center"><a name="VSNL slashes Internet leased line rates by a hefty 70%"><br>
    </a>THE KPMG report on managing the public sector has revealed that the agencies worldwide
    has pointed out concerns over the security and confidentiality in the implementation of
    e-governance. <br>
    <br>
    But the case will be little different for India, said Atui Pradhan, executive director of
    KPMG. India is very much suited for the implementation of the e-governance. <br>
    <br>
    According to the survey, governments and agencies of all forms displayed a strong
    commitment to greater use of technology. National targets for the delivery of services on
    line often reinforced this trend. The governments are largely using information technology
    for the purpose of sharing information with constituents and other organisations and
    increasingly for simple online transaction and basic interactivity. <br>
    <br>
    The report further added that security and accessibility remain significant concerns.
    However, governments are keen to pursue the broad potential that new technlogies offer for
    greater efficiency, service convenience and speed, and scope for greater citizen
    participation. They also seek to provide a lead role in the e-revolution as means to
    display their world competitiveness. &quot;Governments are responding to more demanding<br>
    expectations from customers-citizens, employees, businesses and other levels of government
    and they are achieving this through innovative public management,&quot; he added. <br>
    <br>
    It also said that governments including those in India are actively pursuing private
    sector involvement with a focus on greater accountability and governance. <br>
    <br>
    The report which was released on Wednesday by chief vigilance commissioner (CVC) N Vittal
    reveals that government leaders are consistently focusing on expanding public-private
    partnerships and adopting 'e-government' technologies as they negotiate strategies to
    redefine government roles and responsibilities. <br>
    <br>
    Mr Vittal said the year 2001 is the year of e-governance. The country which is suffering
    from large scale corruption is largely due to the lack of transparency and procedural
    delays and could be checked through introducing e-governance, he added. What we are now
    seeing are alliances or joint ventures, such as private financial initiatives, that
    reflect a greater level of sophistication. Although core services and roles vary, the
    government officials are searching for new and better ways to develop public-private
    partnerships, said Mr<br>
    Pradhan. <br>
    <br>
    He said governments were entering a brave new phase, from the re-invention and
    re-invention of the past decade to 'e-invention' with technology at the forefront. <br>
    <br>
    KPMG which has set up a dedicated governance practice in india this year had already
    conducted structured interviews during the the first quarter of 2000 with 97 senior
    government officials from nine developed nations including Australia, Canada, France,
    Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the united
    states. </p>

    <p align="center">The world's largest microprocessor manufacturer, Intel Corporation today
    launched its newest chip. Pentium 4, in two speeds of 1.5 Ghz and 1.4 Ghz, which will be
    priced at $819 and $644, respectively, for 1000 quantities. <br>
    <br>
    Because of its geographical location, India became the first country to taste the power of
    Pentium 4. <br>
    <br>
    The prices would be cut by the end of 2001 as a part of the chip maker's strategy to bring
    Pentium 4 into mainstream computing and replace its current volume desktop chip, Pentium
    III. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Next year we will bring the chip to the mainstream by cutting their price. By the
    end of the year, it will occupy the place that Pentium III currently enjoys,&quot; Avtar
    Saini, Intel's director, South Asia, said here. <br>
    <br>
    A 2-Ghz version of the chip, which is based on the high-performance Intel 850 chipset and
    is targeted at desktop computing, will also be available in the third quarter of 2001. <br>
    <br>
    All major hardware vendors, both Indian and international, as well as software suppliers
    have been working on developing products based on Pentium 4. The big desktop<br>
    PC makers already have workstations based on Pentium 4 and many manufacturers are expected
    to start taking orders today for PCs based on the latest chip. <br>

    <p align="center">Set a thief to catch a thief seems to be the mantra of eAlcatraz, a
    digital security &amp; consulting start-up, which has floated a security advisory club for
    the corporate sector. <br>
    <br>
    And those who are part of the club include amateur hackers and those with a passion for
    technology. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We have a team of &quot;white hat' hackers who conduct penetration tests and form
    the core of our solutions team,&quot; says Venky S, the chief executive officer of
    eAlcatraz. <br>
    <br>
    Venky said the club offers free services to corporates, including includes regular alerts,
    security advisories and free information. &quot;Indian corporates have taken security very
    seriously but some are equally ignorant about the issue,&quot; Venky said. <br>
    <br>
    To them (corporates), it means building firewalls, installing anti-virus software, but for
    us it is a state of mind which starts from the gate of corporates,&quot; Sri Ram, the
    chief technology officer of eAlcatraz said. <br>
    <br>
    eAlcatraz, which officially commenced operations in November, is set to get around $3
    million in the first round of funding from EURIndia, a UK-based venture fund. <br>
    <br>
    It had earlier received around $1 million from ePowern as seed capital and has spent
    nearly half a-million dollars on its research and development laboratory. Venky said that
    eAlcatraz is derived from the infamous Alcatraz (meaning rock&quot;) prison, which,
    according to<br>
    legend, only one prisoner has been able to escape from. &quot;Our company wants to protect
    the information assets of corporates and create a digital Alcatraz,&quot; Venky said. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We maintain contacts within the security and hacker communities to stay abreast of
    the latest intrusion techniques,&quot; he said. <br>
    <br>
    According to Venky, a professional hacker is dangerous and difficult to combat. They are
    experts at finding holes in security systems and exploiting weaknesses in soft <br>
    <br>
    ware. Once inside a. system they can-remove data or change a website. A new phenomenon
    among cybercriminals is to demand cash from organisations after hacking systems. <br>
    <br>
    Venky said corporates must have a well-thought plan on how to respond, contain and recover
    from information incidents. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We have a dedicated on-call security response team (SRT) which is composed of
    security professionals dedicated to providing 24x7x365 incident response support,&quot; he
    said. He said it is critical that security is built into business processes from the start
    and from the bottom up not bolted on after the processes and systems have been designed
    and implemented. <br>
    <br>
    Sri Ram said the team consists of professionals certified skill sets .such as .Checkpoint
    Cisco, Sun and Microsoft. ISS the company has developed structured framework, to offer
    organisations an end-to-end secure life cycle solution comprising of risk
    assessment,security<br>
    architecture design. mentation, staff education monitoring. <br>
    <br>
    Among the services offered by eAlcatraz include Access Control Systems, the first in
    information security at the network point, and public key infrastructure (PKI), a secure
    infrastructure that enables electronic integrity within an organisation's local area
    network and its external business<br>

    interest&quot; in partnering with the ministry of information technology in its programmes
    to bridge the digital divide in the country in particular the IT for masses and the
    Operation Knowledge programmes. <br>
    <br>
    Speaking to reporters after a meeting with IT minister Pramod Mahajan, World Bank
    president James Wolfensohn said no country was in a better position than India was to use
    IT for the poor. To this end, he has asked Mr Mahajan&nbsp; to send a project report on
    the proposal to expand the Community Information Centre (CIC)programme which is already
    being rolled out across 446 blocks in North-East and 40 blocks in Sikkim. A pilot project
    has already been implemented in 30 blocks of North East and Sikkim at a cost of<br>
    $ 3 million. <br>
    <br>
    Mr Mahajan said he proposed to extend the CIC plan to the entire country. This proposal to
    be sent in 2-3 days to the World Bank president, envisages tile extension of the CIC
    programme to S,000 blocks across the country at an estimated cost of $ I billion. </p>

    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">The war has begun. After Internet access, it ¦ is now the turn of
    Internet leased lines and international private leased circuits (IPLCs). VSNL today
    sounded the bugle with a 70 per cent cut in Internet leased line tariff for a 2 mbps link
    per annum. The rates for IPLCs have been slashed by 7 5 per cent. From January 1,01,
    Internet leased lines will cost Rs 12.5 lakh per year for a 2 mbps line against Rs 41.8
    lakh now, while IPLC of a similar capacity will cost Rs 40 lakh as against Rs 163 lakh
    now. <br>
    <br>
    These rates are applicable for Mumbai and Cochin, the landing points for VSNL's undersea
    cables, and for taking the traffic from these cities to any other part of the country, the
    customer would have to pay the domestic leased line charges which are currently Rs 15 lakh
    per annum for a 2 mbps link. Along with the reduction in tariffs, VSNL has also announced
    a streamlining of these tariffs. The tariff for leased lines, which was earlier different
    for European and American subcontinents, has now been streamlined and a single unified
    tariff is applicable worldwide. The tariff is also uniformly applicable to all customers.
    The latest price reduction follows a 50 per cent reduction announced in January, 2000,
    whereby the prices of international private leased lines were reduced by half for ISPs and
    25 per cent for general category customers. &quot;We will still see at least a 200-300 per
    cent jump in bandwidth demand following the move. Our revenues, which are currently at
    about Rs 260 crore (or half of the total value-added services revenue), will continue to
    grow at about 20 per cent even after these steep cuts,&quot; VSNL's finance director RSP
    Sinha told ET. <br>
    <br>
    He said that the move will benefit a host of corporates, especially activities like call
    centres and software exports. Highly placed sources said that the move is VSNL's answer to
    a spate of private players deciding to set up undersea cables networks. It was felt that
    before these players can fructify their business plans, it would make sense to cut tariffs
    and grab the market share. <br>
    <br>
    VSNL had only recently come out with a &quot;monsoon package&quot; for Internet access
    where it offered free access during night and on Sundays for three years. The package got
    it 50,000 new subscribers. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;International bandwidth rates are falling sharply. As our procurement price for
    bandwidth is coming down, we feel that we can pass on the benefits to our customers,&quot;
    said Mr Sinha. </p>

    education,legal sectors etc will start from January 1, 2001. <br>
    <br>
    The Government, however, has decided to adopt extreme caution, in issuing digital
    signature certificates to the Prime Minister arid his Cabinet colleagues owing to
    extremely sensitive nature of their jobs. It is feared that any hacking into their
    IT.systems by unscruplous elements might spell disaster for the country. <br>
    <br>
    Accordingly, the government has decided to delay issuance of digital signature
    certificates to them till it attains better grip over controlling cybercrime and hack
    proof systems for various ministries. <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, the Information Technology ministry, in consultation with its subsidiary
    National Informatics Centre, has prepared training modules to orient all police officers,
    belonging to Indian Police Service and state police services towards the cyber laws and
    cyber crimes. <br>

    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">The government deserves all praise for
    legislating and enacting the Information Technology Act in</font> <font face="Arial"
    size="2">record time. Though the bill was passed by Parliament I last May and assented to
    by the President in June, some time has understandably been taken in framing the necessary
    rules and working out the other modalities of its implementation. The new law came into
    effect on October 18 by virtue of a notification issued by the government and the
    appointment of the controller of certifying authority (CCA) for the authorisation of
    digital signatures. With this, India becomes one of the few countries in the world &#151;
    and second in Asia, after Singapore &#151; to have an IT law.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">The greatest impact of the new law will be
    on electronic commerce. Even if e-commerce might be slow to pick up domestically, most
    export-import companies would require it increasingly for dealing with their clients
    abroad, who are already on e-commerce. Many trade transactions abroad are all based on
    e-commerce solutions and those countries that do not have a legal framework for
    e-transactions are bound to lag behind in the emerging world trade scenario. The IT Act,
    thus, will have a significant role to play in India's positioning in world trade. Apart
    from authentication of digital signatures by the CCA, the act provides for the use of
    electronic documents for all kinds of e-commerce activities, including their acceptance by
    government offices. It also brings under the ambit of law electronic crimes such as
    hacking, which are rampant in the cyber world.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">Though concerns have been expressed in
    certain quarters over the wide powers given to police officials in preventing cyber crime,
    the new IT law should be viewed as an evolving exercise. The government should be willing
    I to learn from experience and apply necessary correctives from time to time. There are
    also concerns about third party liabilities for service and access providers.
    Incidentally,</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">the new IT Act itself might be
    short-lived, as a larger i convergence legislation has been recommended by the Fali S
    Nariman sub-group and accepted by the group of ministers. This legislation will subsume
    the IT Act and its institutions, all of which will come under the proposed communication
    commission of India that will regulate both the carriage and the content.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the cyber legislation needs
    concurrent development of legal expertise, as most lawyers are not conversant with it.
    This is a serious lacuna that can restrict widespread use of e-services. Institutions such
    as the Bar Council of India should take up this challenge i and facilitate education of
    legal practitioners and judges to create a pool of expertise in cyber laws. There is also
    need for a parallel review of other legislations, such ,as the Income Tax Act to make
    their provisions compatible with the IT Act.</font></p>

    The Committee of Secretaries A on downsizing is working out the details of bringing back
    some key ministries into the shape that they were in before the National Democratic
    Alliance government came to power. <br>
    <br>
    Unlike the perception created by the NDA government that the creation of new departments
    and ministries will smoothen the industrial development, the committee is apparently of
    the view that the plethora of departments is actually creating too many levels in economic
    decision-making. <br>
    <br>
    Accordingly, the CoS has recommended that the ministry of heavy industry and public
    enterprises, ministry of small-scale industry and agro and rural industries, the
    Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion and the Department of Industrial Development
    be merged into one. <br>
    <br>
    To reduce the time taken to clear major investment decisions Prime Minister Atal Bihari
    Vajpayee recently announced the creation of a special management group in the PMO to cut
    short the process. <br>
    <br>
    Also, the industrial aspects like industry regulation of the petroleum ministry should be
    transferred to the new ministry. The proposal also envisages the merger of textiles
    ministry and the departments of chemicals, coal and food processing with the industry
    ministry. <br>
    <br>
    In an attempt to bring about a convergence in government policy making, the CoS has also
    suggested that the ministry of communication which would consist of the Department of
    Telecommunication and department of posts consequent to the corporatisation of the
    departments oftelecom operations and telecom services &#151;should be merged with the
    ministry of information technology that was set up last year&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The government is also looking at restructuring other ministries and
    departments including mines and minerals. <br>
    <br>
    There is a proposal to create a ministry consequent to the merger of department of mines
    and minerals. The new ministry would also include oil exploration and laws pertaining to
    the mines and minerals. </p>

    double the intake of number of technology students in the next academic session in
    professional colleges.This indication was given by a senior official of ministry of
    information technology (MIT) P V Jayakrishnan at a function to launch a research project
    of .Indian Institute of Technology&nbsp; <br>
    (IIT)&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">IIT has entered into an agreement with Sun Microsystems for
    collaborative research in cutting edge technologies. IIT Delhi, Kharagpur and Kanpur will
    be participating in the research project, a JV between the premier technological institute
    and private sector.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">India chums out about 73,000 students every year in the field of
    information technology. The secretary of the ministry said that the government was
    focusing on about 60 to 70 institutions, including academic bodies and private companies
    offering education in&nbsp; <br>
    information technology, as part of the plan to boost technology graduates, he said.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">&quot;Our concern is now of quality (of graduates),&quot; said Mr
    Jayakrishnan, adding that a government panel was studying the issue to make appropriate
    changes at the faculty level to increase the number of students.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">McKinsey and Co said last year that aided by appropriate policies, the
    sector would account for 2.2 million jobs by 2008.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">Earlier, global IT major Sun Microsystems entered into an agreement with
    IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur and IIT Kharagpur for launching its 'collaborative research
    programme' aimed at focused joint research in cutting edge technologies.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">&quot;Under the memorandum of understanding (Moli) Sun would team up
    with faculty and students from the institutes and undertake collaborative research on
    technologies such as protocol verification of mobile systems, replication of web resources
    and server selection,&quot; Sun Microsystems Lbs director Jeff Rulifson said.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">Other areas of research would include mobile agent based transcoding
    framework, compilation issues in Java software and high performance digital design.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The intellectual property right (IPR) for projects initiated under the
    programme would be jointly owned by Sun and the concerned university, Mr Rulifson said
    adding that India was the only country in the Asian region where Sun had launched the
    collaborative research programme.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The company is also negotiating with other premier institutions

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Internet access through cable will account for 24 per
    cent of the overall volume by the end of March 2005, while access through dial-up
    subscribers is expected to decrease from the present level of 84.6 per cent in March 2000
    to 70 per cent by March 2005.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">In a report titled Indian bandwidth requirement for
    Internet Services (2000 -2005), the American consultancy firm Frost &amp; Sullivan further
    says that the share of leased line in Internet access will decrease from the pre sent
    level of 7.7 per cent to 2 per cent in March 2000.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Similarly, Internet access through Integrated Services
    Digital Network (ISDN) lines, which permits communication of data voice and other traffic,
    will decrease steadily from the present level of 7.8 per cent to only 1 percent at the end
    of the 200405 fiscal. The firm predicted a bandwidth demand of only 1 gbps for ISDN
    services.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The forecast for the bandwidth requirement for cable
    Internet access services in March 2005 is 8.4 gbps.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Besides cable access services, direct subscriber link
    (DSL) is the only segment which is likely to improve its share.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The share of bandwidth requirement for DSL services is
    predicted to increase from 2 per cent in 2002 fiscal to 3 per cent in 2005. &quot;Given
    the late introduction of DSL services, the likely growth in four years period is
    tremendous,&quot; manager telecom practices Anil Joseph said.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The bandwidth requirement for the provision of services
    by 2005 is likely to be 1 gbps. The demand for higher bandwidth lines from corporates is
    expected to help the leased line segment from a drastic decline despite its likely low
    share in total Internet services market,&quot; Joseph added.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The share of ISDN segment is expected to drop from 7.8
    per cent to 1 per cent during the forecast period of 2000-2005.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The major reason for the drop in the share of ISDN
    services is its low effective bandwidth requirement compared to DSL and leased lines.</font>

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The relaxation in immigration laws assume significance

    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">India is comfortably placed till
    2008 as far as the domestic demand for information technology (IT) manpower is concerned,
    at present levels of demand.However, the concerns enlisted in the discussion paper
    presented at the first meeting of Task Force on Human Resource Development&nbsp; in
    Information Technology, are the unpredictable growth of IT sector world wide, the
    consequent exodus of IT professionals as also the country's inability to move up the IT
    value chain.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">According to the Ministry of
    Information Technology (MIT), there will be no shortfall of&nbsp; manpower supply till
    2008. On the demand side, it has worked out a figure of 23.67 lakh in three categories - 2
    lakh in software products, 5.77 lakh in IT services and 12.9 lakh in IT-enabled services
    and e-business.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Based on the current intake
    capacity in various institutions and projected additions till 2008, around 2.63 lakh
    postgraduates (including MCAs), 7.85 lakh graduates and 7.42 lakh diploma holders will be
    added. Taking into account the migration of professionals from electronics and
    communications,10.48 lakh IT graduates will be available for the hard-core IT sector and
    7.4 lakh for the IT-enabled services from the AICTE recognized institutions. Also, under
    the drive to increase intake, during the current year, nearly 16,000 seats are likely to
    be added.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Institutions like IITs, IIMs and
    IISe are expected to add nearly 10,000 graduates by 2008. Therefore, against an additional
    requirement of nearly 7.6 lakh for hard-core IT sector, 10.6 lakh graduates will be added
    to the system by 2008 providing adequate cushion for international migration and
    attrition.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">But, being unable to put a figure
    to the global demand, the discussion paper has proposed the setting up of a nodal center
    that can project supply and assess demand in IT sector. Keeping in mind the need for</font><font
    size="+1"> </font><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">training and retraining IT
    professionals, it has recommended government's intervention, for which Rs 2,800 crore have
    been earmarked. These initiatives include increase in the intake of quality institutions
    and improvement in others. Taking 1999-2000 as the base year, it has suggested that intake
    could be doubled by the next academic year and made three-times by 2003-04.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">This apart from introducing new
    courses in select institutions like the IITs and RECs. It also proposes to adopt for this
    purpose 250 institutions, out of which 205 will be government-aided.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">To meet infrastructure and
    faculty requirements, the paper proposes a cluster approach, comprising 65 institutions
    including 6 IITs, 2 IIITs, IISe Bangalore and the 6 IIMs and 50 other select ones, wherein
    they can synergise the strengths by sharing the</font><font size="+1"> </font><font
    size="+0" face="Times New Roman">faculty, courseware, good insructional resources, etc.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">An amount of Rs 90 crore has leen
    sanctioned for the IITs for upgradingthe infrastructure from within the normal )udgetary
    allocation.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">An amount of Rs 8-10 crore vould
    be required for computing and ntworking facilities for the 50 institutes. The dditional
    classrooms and faculty requiremots in all the 65 institutions will require anther Rs 200
    crore and Rs 50 crore pe annum, respectively. Another Rs 50 core per annum will be
    required for tracing and retraining teachers under the Faculty Development Fund.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Other suggestions include
    innediate implementation of the PG Review Committee, which recommends siting up of schools
    of advanced study an special research groups; focus on post gradate education and research
    given that weproduce only 25 Ph.D and 300 M.Tech degre holders in a year as compared to
    800 PIDs and 10,000 masters degree holders prcuced in the US.</font> </p>

    up an Internet-based Application Service Provider (ASP) service, a customer relationship
    management competence center and a voice and Web-based call center facility.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The CRM competence center will be spread across 10,000 sq feet and will
    be located within ERDCI building in Noida near Delhi.&nbsp; <br>
    It proposes to train over 500 students each year for a career as call center agents, said
    Netspace managing director, Pankaj Garg.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">While ERDCI, a scientific society under the Ministry of Information
    Technology, will provide the neccessary infrastructure and equipment, Netspace will
    provide the hardware and software support.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">Though both sides will put money in the venture, Garg refused to
    disclose the amount being invested in the project, &quot;When fully operational, all three
    activities will require a large sum which will be equally shared by ERDCI,&quot; he said.
    The entire project is expected to be up and running within two months.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The call center facility will initially have 50 seats and be expanded to
    100 in the second phase. It will target domestic customers, but look at international
    offshore clients later. &quot;We are putting in the switch-based communications
    infrastructure, scalable servers and other world-class facilities which are often missing
    in other call centers directed at a domestic audience. Our aim is also to offer the entire
    gamut of services and solutions to companies wanting to set up call centers,&quot; said

    <p align="center">The government is consider ing to make literacy in information

    <p align="center">The ministry of information technology has made the proposal which is
    presently under government consideration. The IT ministry wants the basic course
    parameters to be prepared that would define IT literacy.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">In cases where a person has to be recruited without IT literacy, he/she
    would be made to acquire the skills within one year of recruitment.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">For the existing staff, the government is considering to make them
    attain IT literacy in the next two years.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">For this, a panel of recognised training institutions at central and
    state government level is be ing set up. These institutions, in private as well as public
    sector, will be updated from time to time to keep pace with technology.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The proposal also wants all central and state government de partments to
    prepare a time-bound plan to establish govern ment intranets with connectivi ty to each
    other and the Internet. The ministry also suggested that steps should be taken to ensure
    that the information technology infrastructure is in place by year 2003.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The government feels that for the information technology ser vices to be
    developed and sus tained, it is necessary that the necessary infotech infrastructure is
    established and made available to the working-level staff.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The proposal envisages that all IT-enabled services be made web-centric
    so that they are accessible to the public through the Internet.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The government has already taken a few measures in this regard. The
    advisory committee on information technolgy has suggested upgradation of 43 engineering
    colleges, up to the level of the Indian Institutes of Technology.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The activities of National Centre for Software Technology are being
    expanded in Karnataka at Bangalore and in Maharashtra at Navi-Mumbai to impart advanced
    education and training.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The computing and networking facilities in the six IITs are being
    upgraded to global standards. In addition, capacity of graduate and postgraduate
    programmes at premier institutes is being in creased. The government has also set up
    Indian Institutes of Information Technology at Gwalior and Allahabad in the central and at
    Hyderabad, Bangalore, Calcutta and Trivandrum in the state sector.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) is encouraging new

    by Japanese Prime Minister Yushiro Mori and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
    after talks yesterday.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">As part of the interaction between India and Japan, more multi-entry
    visas valid for up to three years to Indian IT professionals working in Japan, the
    training of 1,000 technicians in the Japanese language and business practices, the Mori
    fellowship to be awarded to 1,000 young people every year for the next five years; and
    more frequent meetings between Japanese and Indian leaders at the political level are
    planned.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">Japanese and Indian IT professionals will also get the support of their
    governments in holding FT symposia and expert-level meetings.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">The cooperation between the private sector in Japan and India, foreign
    direct investment and humanitarian assistance to India will continue,&quot; external
    affairs minister Jaswant Singh said.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">In addition, an economic mission will come to India in October to take
    the economic aspect of the dialogue forward, Jaswant Singh said.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">As part of the exercise to widen and deepen cooperation, the Indian
    Prime Minister has been invited to Japan next year. President K R Narayanan will also be
    visiting Japan. At the political level, Japan has condemned all forms of terrorism.
    However, Jaswant Singh said, in reply to a question on whether sanctions had been lifted,
    that of all countries in the world, India was most sensitive to Japan's feelings on the
    issue of weapons of mass destruction, because Japan had been a victim of these. Over the
    years, Japan had developed various laws and regulations on the relationship it should have
    with countries which had nuclear weapons.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">Its reactions were a result of domestic consensus. At the same time, he
    said, India did not subscribe to the notion of sanctions, and expected that Japan would be
    as sensitive to India's security concerns.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">More importantly, Japan had agreed to continue its dialogue with India
    and had actually invited India to discuss strategic issues, he said.&nbsp; <br>

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Mr Mahajan said the government proposed to keep these
    rules on a web page for about two weeks during which suggestions and objections would be
    invited from representatives of trade, industry and business associations besides members
    of public.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">On receipt of these, the rules will be suitably modified
    and then finally published, he told reporters after inaugurating the Centre for Electronic
    Governance set up here by the ministry.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The centre for e-governance has been set up with a view
    to collating and disseminating the best practices of e-governance for use by the central
    and state governments.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The activities of the centre include demonstration of
    feasibility of the concepts in e-governance to decision makers through workshops, video
    demonstrations and tele-conferences, help the central and state governments in defining
    and implementing the process and policy changes.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The minister said the first area of draft rules involved
    the appointment of certain authorities for implementing various provisions of the Act.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Under this, rules have been provided for the appointment
    of the Controller, the Adjudication Officer, the Presiding Officer, and the Cyber
    Appellate Tribunal.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">One of the key functionaries would be the Controller,
    who will lay down standards and supervise activities of the certifying authorities.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The other important issue which has been dealt by the
    rules is one of specifying qualifications of becoming a certifying authority. He will be
    granted a licence to issue a digital signature certificate. The security of transactions
    taking place on the net will depend on the quality and control that he has on
    certificates.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The rules specify the amount of paid-up capital, the
    bank guarantee and various other requirements that one will have to fulfil before one is
    granted a licence for issuing digital signature certificate. They will also cover issues
    like the period of validity of licence granted and the payment to be made.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The rules also provide for procedures for creating
    secure electronic record and secure digital signature. They have been framed on the man</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">ner in which the adjudicating officer will hold an
    inquiry if disputes arise.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The e-business focuses its element on telephone,
    computers and web sites as the basis for deciding competitiveness of a country.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">It can help the companies to lower costs dramatically
    across supply and demand chains, take their customer service to a different league, enter
    new markets, create additional revenue streams and re-define business relationships.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">According to a Nasscom-McKinsey study, no more than Rs
    131 crore of e-commerce was transferred in 1999, while investments exceeded Rs 1000 crore.
    But, revenues will more than double this year to Rs 450 crore.</font> </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The government celebrates August 15 with work shut-

    coming golden age. Which is why the Union ministry of information technology deserves some
    applause.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">It marked the day with two innovative steps. One, it put
    the entire draft of rules for enforcing the landmark Information Technology Act on its
    website. for citizen reaction. For any law the government usually prepares the all-
    important rules behind closed doors and notifies them without bothering to check with the
    public.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">For a change, the information technology ministry has
    invited citizens' reactions to its set of rules at the ministry website <a

    suggesting where to locate and what to name the key posts created under the Act.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">&quot;We'll then examine the feedback and complete this
    job in another two weeks,&quot; says IT minister Pramod Mahajan. &quot;The final
    notification should be out by September 15.'' On which date, then, India will have an
    entire legal framework for electronic transactions, from digital signing to a multitude of
    others. Besides provisions on cyber crime.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The second interesting Independence Day event at

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">For instance, a system has been developed for the Jaipur
    police, allowing the filing of a police case (FIR) online, without coming to the station.

    and supervision of the contracts, approvals, stores, work-in-progress reports and accounts
    control.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Another system. for the Vijayawada municipality, enables
    on-line applications and responses on various functions: building approvals, health
    programmes, registration certificates, engineering works and so forth. Citizens can access
    data on any of these and also get their work done without coming to a municipal office; at
    the other end, their needs can be serviced, their suggestions registered, all without
    processing paper files and applications.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">All these, and many more &#151; the &quot;best
    practice&quot; inventions &#151; have been brought under one roof. And programmes are
    being readied to call for training staffers in government offices from all over India, to
    jumpstart a national revolution in governance, using IT. Hardware, software, ideas,
    personnel &#151; it's a one-stop shop.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">&quot;The idea,&quot; explains Union IT secretary P V
    Jayakrishnan, &quot;is to avoid duplication and enable replication, in all states, of the
    best practices, selected from everywhere.&quot; Arun Shourie told Mahajan he's already
    booking for two things: Revamping the administrative reforms department's functioning and
    thinking and, once the planned disinvestment in 17 state-run undertakings gets going, to
    have them put in place a bidding and evaluation system which is &quot;as open as
    possible.&quot;</font> <br>

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">This would represent a growth of more than 200 per cent

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">To achieve the projected revenues of $10 billions by

    The must include the passage of the Information Technology Act, approval to 100 per cent
    foreign direct investment in B2C e-commerce and ISP companies and zero per cent taxation
    of e-commerce in the current year, said Mr. Mehta.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Nasscom demanded a three to five-year moratorium on

    Nasscom that supply must precede the demand for bandwidth in the country if the bandwidth
    issue has to be tackled.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">To implement this, the government plans to offer
    bandwidth on demand within two months, he said at the inauguration of Nasscom's E-biz
    2000, the national conference on e-commerce and e-business.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Explaining the delay in the implementations of
    documented plans for the provision of bandwidth, Mr Ghosh said that it took about five
    months for the DOT to get clearances from various departments after the tenders</font><font

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Currently the government-owned VSNL holds a capacity of
    325 Mb of international internet bandwidth: It has a few limitations In increasing the
    bandwidth mainly on account of the regulatory procedures. Nasscom president Dewang Mehta,
    however, pleaded with the DoT secretary to increase the bandwidth to provide 2Mbp per
    person in India figuring the boom in the e-commerce business in the country. &quot;To meet
    the demand of domestic bandwidth, the government has already laid 17 lakh kilometers of
    optical fibre cable network throughout the country and by the end of the year plans to lay
    another one lakh kilometers,&quot; he said. The state has planned the laying of optical
    fibre via pipelinesunder main highways and other&nbsp;&nbsp; roads during the

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">NASSCOM'S project Operation Bandwidth has recommended
    setting up toll free numbers facility to connect the international telecommunication links
    to Public Switch Telecom Network (PSTN) on either side to software export companies. It
    has also asked to allow interconnectivity between networks of different service providers.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Nasscom has also suggested a drastic reduction in
    tariffs to encourage more value addition from India and has recommended steeper volume
    discounts so that the companies can take more bandwidth and provide better customer
    service. The survey pointed out that connecting international telecommunication links to
    PSTN would help India become a customer service hub in future and attract various
    organisations to set up their customer service centres in India. PSTN is what MTNL has in
    Delhi and Mumbai network. According to Nasscom, this business alone was projected to bring
    in an additional $30 billion in foreign exchange by the year 2008.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Most US IT companies have set up toll free numbers to
    contact employees of Indian IT companies on a ongoing basis. The charges for such calls do
    not exceed Rs 6 per minute and in some cases are aslow as Rs 4 per minute, the survey
    said' As world class IT companies, Nasscom said, India was expected to leverage technology
    to provide ubiqutious access to employees to corporate and customer network. For instance,
    an employee must be able to check email using a remote PC or a regular phone. This
    requires interconnectivity between all forms of networks.</font> </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="+0">The survey pointed out that DoT was not totally equipped

    service becomes critical to the survival of the IT companies.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">Nasscom said there was a strong need to permit
    interconnectivity between call centres as the load sharing between the centres would lead
    to optimum utilisation of international bandwidth. It would give 24 hours and seven days
    support for critical operations as even a few minutes down time was not acceptable to
    international customers and could lead to loss of credibility.</font> </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+0">It has also recommended that the IT enabled services
    companies be permitted to directly negotiate the capacity requirements with the

    help regional language computing possible.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quoting the example of China, Mahajan said, &quot;In China, IT industry
    is based on their local language -Chinese -and they have managed 1.5 crore internet
    connections while back home IT has not touched many of our lives as it is based in English
    and not more than three to four per cent of Indians can communicate in
    English.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking at the launch of apnamail.com, Mahajan said in 5 to 10 years,
    voice recognition will become a widespread phenomenon. That is when a lot of emphasis will
    be given to the regional languages and the usage of local languages will go a long way in
    removing the digital divide between those who are Net-savvy and those who are not, he
    added.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaborating further, Mahajan said the increased usage of the Indian
    languages in IT will be the empowering tool in not only taking the benefits of IT to the
    masses, it will also be the key ingredient in outlining road map for India in becoming an

    <p align="center">THE total Indian infotech industry grew by an impressive 62.9 per cent
    in 1999-2000, according to the annual industry survey released by Computers Today, of
    India Today Group.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total industry revenue stood at Rs 29.513 crore (approximately $6.6
    billion) in 1999-2000, up from Rs 18.120crorein 1998-99. This represents the highest
    annual growth rate in the last decade.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The software industry, as usual, ruled the roost. In 1999-2000. Indian
    software exports earned Rs 15,290 crore, a 69 per cent over the 1998-99 revenues of Rs
    9,048 crore.The domestic software industry showed a better performance with 94 percent
    increase, from Rs 1,810 crore to Rs 3,523 crore in the last financial year, a release
    issued by the Computers Today says.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The baton to lead the infotech industry changed hand four years ago in
    1997-98,when the software segment (Rs 6,690 crore) raced past its hardware counterpart (Rs
    5,072 crore). In 1999-2000, the hardware industry, involving even the peripheral sales and
    data communications equipment, posted revenues of about Rs 7,720 crore, which is less than
    40 percent of the total software industry turnover. What's more, among the CT 101
    companies, more than 80 were purely software and services Firms. For the rest too, the
    software component often accounted for more than half of the gross sales.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, however, not to belittle the hardware industry's performance.
    After a constant slide since 1996 and a negative growth of six-percent in 1998-99, this
    segment has turned around impressively with more than 52 per cent increase in 1999-2000.
    The hardware industry revenues totaled to Rs 7,720 crore from Rs 5,072 crore in
    1998-99.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardware exports have jumped up 100 per cent, to Rs 600 crore. A
    sweeping frenzy for Internet and the affordability of PCs has contributed to PC sales
    crossing the ever-promised and long-touted one million mark. The total PC installed base
    now stands at just above 2.7 million units. In revenues, the PC industry grew from Rs
    3,296.5 crore in 1998-99 to Rs 4,810 crore in 1999-2000.&nbsp; </p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">THE Tamil Nadu Government is looking at two
    possible locations for the Tidel Park-II.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the inauguration of the park on
    Tuesday, the Chief Minister. Mr. M. Karunanidhi, announced that another software park
    would be set up &quot;very soon&quot; in Chennai.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to official sources, the
    Government has the option of setting up Tidel Park-II on a 10-acre plot of land belonging
    to a Government department on arterial Anna Salai.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A business-cum-financial centre was
    proposed to be developed on this site, for which the Government even invited bids. But,
    this proposal has been put on the backburner. This centre was to have a plinth area of
    11-lakh sq.ft.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is now looking into whether
    it can put up the proposed Tidel Park-II at this location. The software park will be right
    in the heart of the city and hence command a premium, according to the sources. However,
    they point out that issues like whether the road will be able to take high density
    vehicular movement from one point (at least 2,500 vehicles) need to be considered before
    taking a decision.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; The other location would be on the Old
    Mahabalipuram Road, past the Tidel Park, where land is available. The State Industries
    Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (Sipcot) is establishing an IT park extending over
    1,000 acres at Siruseri on<b> </b>the Old Mahabalipuram Road.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the inauguration of the Tidel Park, the Chief
    Minister referred to the State's efforts to promote IT and urged the Centre to encourage
    STPI to set<b> </b>up international data links throughout Tamil Nadu. He also wanted the
    Union Human Resources Development Ministry to establish an institute of information
    technology and management in Chennai at the earliest. Besides, Mr. Karunanidhi wanted the
    Center to establish a landing point in Chennai for the inter-continental, undersea fibre
    optic cable.</font> <br>

    &nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center">Economic Times&nbsp; 6.7.2000 <font face="Times New Roman">THE Planning
    Commission has recommended the opening of Internet telephony, coming out stridently
    against the existing policy, which does not permit transmission of voice over public
    Internet.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The telecom chapter of the Planning
    Commission's Mid-Term Review of the 9th Five Year Plan says the opening of Internet
    telephony will lead to optimum use of resources and provision of least cost services to
    the consumers. It further says that since VSNL, DoT and MTNL are already leading ISPs,
    opening up of Internet telephony would provide them with a greater opportunity to be major
    players in this area.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening of Internet telephony will not harm
    national interest in any way, the document says. &quot;In fact, it is bound to
    revolutionise the long distance communications as it will provide services at a fraction
    of the present cost. The existing policy should not be allowed to hold back the benefits
    accruing from technological innovations if it is not against the interest of the nation
    and the consumers. Opening of Internet telephony like data services will not harm national
    interest in any way,&quot; it reads.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Planning Commission further says that
    with the convergence of technologies, service segmentations and a separate licence for
    each service becomes redundant and work only as artificial barriers. It recommends a
    single licence for all telecom services and evolving a common revenue share formula.
    Telecom services would include fixed line telephony. Internet, mobile telephony and
    satellite services. This will help in the liberalisation of the sector and ensure a
    desirable perfect competition model.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to DoT's views, the Planning Commission
    is against competitive bidding for the award of national long distance (NLD) licences as
    this would restrict the number of players. It suggests a one-time entry fee and no
    restriction on the number of NLD operators. DoT has been known to be opposed to this idea.</font>
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; The final blow to DoT is the&nbsp; Planning
    Commission's recommendation that NLD operators should carry intra circle long distance
    traffic as this would increase competition and give the subscriber the option of choosing
    the NLD operator of their preference.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendations say the
    artificial distinction between intra circle and inter circle long distance connectivity
    would become redundant in the face of emerging technological innovations. The
    liberalisation of the ISP sector is a befitting model to prove that unrestricted
    competition helps expand the user base and reduces cost to the customer, the report urges.</font>

    similarities as far as crime and criminals go.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; A spurt in crimes in the cyber highways of
    India, though much less compared to advanced countries, worries the experts a lot - for
    the law enforcing agencies are still groping in dark about the means and mode to check
    them.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rajan Bhagat, ACP, Intellectual Property
    Rights (IPR) section in the Crime Branch of Delhi Police says &quot; the IT Act&nbsp; has
    given extra responsibility to the police to check the offence in the cyber world. We have
    to see how we can approach the problem as and when it comes.&quot;</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyber crimes have several manifestations -
    Hacking, stalking and squatting. The national security could be endangered if sensitive
    sites are hacked to destroy and mutilate documents. A person can be stalked on the
    internet causing a lot of harassment without even revealing the identity and by squatting,
    a cyber criminal can misuse the name and fame of a reputed person.</font> <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; &quot;The new Information Technology Act talks about
    criminal and civil offences in the Cyber world. But the offences defined in the Act are by
    no means exhaustive. The drafting of the relevant provisions of the IT Act makes it appear
    as if the offences detailed in the Act are only cyber offences that can be commited,&quot;
