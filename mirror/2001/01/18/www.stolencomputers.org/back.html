<p><B>BACKGROUND:</B>
<TABLE WIDTH=600><TR><TD>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The sharp increase of personal computer ownership combined with the
introduction of ever- smaller and more compact units has greatly increased
the likelihood of loss by theft.PCs now top the list of most-often-stolen
equipment. The Stolen Computer Registry was formed by an industry consortium
in 1992 to foil hardware theft and foster confidence in the purchase of used computers.
The Registry does not charge for its services.

<P><B>HOW IT WORKS:</B>
<TABLE WIDTH=600><TR><TD>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When a computer is stolen, the make, model and serial number of the 
computer is entered into the REGISTRY’s relational database linked to information 
on the rightful owner and reporting agency. Buyers, resellers, insurers, 
law enforcement, and security professionals check suspicious computers
against this list. When stolen equipment is located, the REGISTRY 
supplies information and assists in recovery and return of property to 
the rightful owners. The Registry does not charge for its services.
