<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are back, while others 
  are taking care of the .il, we`ll focus again on our freinds (India) which could 
  also be defined as the most 'corrupt' state. Today there was one member of lashkar 
  -e- tauba killed by the Indian Police. They claim he was a ISI agent. What could 
  you expect from these jokers? They kill their own people and claim them to be 
  Pakistani ISI agents. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why? Read this!<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With their current "anti 
  Pakistan and their agencies" hysteria of the Indian media they want you to believe 
  that every aspect of their life is infiltrated by ISI. Having thought about 
  it carefully I came to the conclusion that yes maybe they are right. The following 
  is an example of how an ordinary Indian's day is disrupted by ISI: - </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He wakes up early in the 
  morning and stumbles across the room to watch the sun rise, but there are clouds 
  in the sky blocking his view. Obviously ISI are the culprits as they want him 
  to feel depressed, so they sent clouds over India at sun rise. - He than makes 
  his way to the bathroom and starts shaving. What's this, his face gets cut by 
  the blade. Surely ISI must have planted a rogue blade in his bathroom in order 
  to make his life miserable early in the morning. - Having survived two assaults 
  by this terrorist organisation he leaves for work and asks his wife to lock 
  all the doors and baricade herself in the house just in case there is an ISI 
  agent around who might sneak into the house and sabotage it. - </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He than discovers another 
  nefarious plot by the notorious ISI --- all the public transport whether they 
  be buses or trains are overflowing with commuters. Obviously these commuters 
  are ISI plants to stop him from getting to his workplace and contributing to 
  the welfare of his country. - He reaches his workplace after a great effort 
  and discovers that ISI has struck again. There is no elctricity and therfore 
  he cannot carry out his duties. Another clever plot by ISI to sabotage his great 
  nation. - He staggers to lunch during the afternoon but feels drowsy after the 
  meal. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wants to sleep instead of 
  work. What did the ISI put in his food? - On the way back he discovers that 
  the commuter conspiracy is again at work. - Finally he arrives home, his children 
  give him their school report. What, they are not doing well at school. Realises 
  that ISI has infiltrated the education system as well and now are out to destroy 
  the education of the children by sending such reports to parents. - Night falls, 
  he goes to bed, hears a thump outside his bedroom, looks out of the bedroom 
  window ----- ISI ----- life goes on. ....</font></p>
