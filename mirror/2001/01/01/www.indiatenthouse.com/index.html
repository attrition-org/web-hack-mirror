<p>Here is the Exclusive firtst hand report from dawn news in Pakistan</p>
<p>Attack on Red Fort leaves 3 dead: Assailants flee after attack NEW DELHI, Dec 
  23: Two unidentified "militants" opened fire at the historic Red Fort in the 
  Indian capital late on Friday, killing a soldier and two civilians, and then 
  fleeing, police said. Journalists in Srinagar said they had received calls from 
  Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of several groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, claiming 
  responsibility for the attack in New Delhi. "Two people opened fire. We don't 
  know their identities. Three people have been killed, one civilian employee 
  of the defence, one barber and one soldier," Additional Commissioner of Police 
  Ajay Chadha told Reuters. </p>
<p>"They came, they opened fire and disappeared. The search is going on." News 
  agencies said police suspected the gunmen were a suicide - or so-called fidayeen 
  - team typical of those who often strike in Jammu and Kashmir state, where more 
  than 30,000 people have died in the uprising. Part of the Fort, an imposing 
  17th-century edifice built by the Mughal emperor Shajahan that sits on the edge 
  of the Indian capital's old town, is open to tourists during the day.</p>
<p> The rest serves as a garrison for a battalion of at least 1,000 personnel 
  of the army's Rajputana Rifles. A large crowd of reporters and television crews 
  gathered in the dark outside the fort, but soldiers kept them from entering 
  the complex. News agencies quoted police as saying the separatists struck at 
  three different places inside the fort at around 9:40pm (1610 GMT) - while a 
  party attended by families of army personnel was going on. They reportedly fired 
  indiscriminately with automatic weapons. </p>
<p>Agencies said police, while not ruling out the possibility that the gunmen 
  were still holed up inside the Fort, had begun stop-and-search operations on 
  roads leading out of the city. The attack came two days after Indian Prime Minister 
  Atal Behari Vajpayee extended a suspension of hostilities in occupied Kashmir 
  for another four weeks beyond the holy month of Ramazan. Mujahideen groups rejected 
  the extension of India's first-ever ceasefire in Kashmir, but Pakistan responded 
  by announcing a partial withdrawal of its troops from the frontier dividing 
  the nuclear-capable rivals in the Himalayan territory. </p>
<p>The tit-for-tat confidence-building measures have raised hopes that India and 
  Pakistan could soon resume a peace dialogue that was stalled last year by the 
  outbreak of an undeclared war on the snow-capped heights of occupied Kashmir. 
</p>
<p>The Mughal-built fort not only houses a military garrison, but is also one 
  of India's main interrogation centres where hundreds of Muslim separatists have 
  been questioned in the past. Part of the fort is opened for tourists. Their 
  normal strategy has been to force their way into army or police camps, barricade 
  themselves inside a building, and engage the security forces in a shootout.
