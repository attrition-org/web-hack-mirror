Hello everyone out there.

Thought everyone might be intrested in some of the TRUTH about this place.
And i've decided the best way to do this is to list the names, addresses, 
and phone numbers of all the parents, a fairly hefty archive of the WWASP
internal email, the contents of the WWASP BBS forum, and the last couple months
of the 'unofficial' Family Support Link archives.

All this can be seen as follows:

<A HREF="bbs/">WWASP BBS</A> (Note: This is before the big erasure of the forum)
<A HREF="bbs/attach">WWASP BBS Attachments</A>
<A HREF="mail/">WWASP Internal Email</A>
<A HREF="mail/attach/">WWASP Internal Email attachments</A>
<A HREF="fsl/">Family Support Link</A>
<A HREF="data/">Parent Info</A>

I'm sorry for the relative disorder of all the informaiton presented here,
there's a godafwul amount of it, and I havent had the time to sort through all
of it.  

Oh, and I didn't do any of this bullshit renaming your index.html, or saving
any of your site. I wiped it all.

TAINER'S REPORT
CASA BY THE SEA SEPTEMBER 2, 6, 1999   

...

FOCUS:

GENERAL OVERVIEW:

...

There was a kid  name Melissa that had been there for a week from Jamaica.  This
is the kid that had had sex with a staff member.  Some a few of the kids knew about it.
I didn't know until lunch the second day. ... I also spoke with her about the incident 
in Jamaica.  I didn't go into specific details.  She told me it had happen several 
times.  She had told one boy before he left the program.  All of this is very 
disturbing to me.  This girl also said that there is a lot of sexual abuse in her 
family. I didn't bring this up fully in the training.  The part about Jamaica.  
I didn't feel it was in the girls best interest.

Now I don't know about any of you, but don't you think things of this nature should
be brought up? Especially in an "Emotional Growth" seminar? It didn't seem to be against
'the best intrest' when they found out about a kid in Samoa having sex with a local 
village girl.

I suppose that would be discussed as it isn't quite as threatening as one of the 
students fucking a staff member.
