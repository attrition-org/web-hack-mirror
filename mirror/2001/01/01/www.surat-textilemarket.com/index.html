  SRINAGAR, Dec 26: Fourteen people, including four Indian soldiers, were killed 

  and 31 others injured in a car bomb blast on Monday and in an ambush by Mujahideen 

  in occupied Kashmir on Tuesday. <br>

  <br>

  A police spokesman said a patrol of the 32nd Rashtriya Rifles unit was attacked 

  in the Kupwara district. "The patrol was passing the village of Wavoora Lolab," 

  about 100km from here, when they were ambushed, he said. The troops returned 

  the gunfire but four soldiers died and eight others injured, he said. <br>

  <br>

  On Monday, 10 people were killed when Mujahideen set off the powerful car bomb 

  near an army zone here, police and witnesses said. <br>

  <br>

  Two groups claimed responsibility for the explosion, with one of them asserting 

  the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who had traveled from Britain 

  for the mission. <br>

  <br>

  A police spokesman said six Indian soldiers, three civilians and a freedom fighter 

  were among those killed. <br>

  <br>

  At least 23 others were injured in the attack in Srinagar's fortified Badami 

  Bagh army cantonment district. <br>

  <br>

  The previously-unknown Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen was the first to claim responsibility 

  for the blast, adding that the attackers had escaped unharmed. <br>

  <br>

  The Jaish-i-Mohammad also said it was responsible. It identified the attacker 

  as Abu Abdullah from Birmingham, Britain. They said he was on a suicide mission 

  and died in the blast. Srinagar's police chief, however, rejected the claim 

  and said the attack was conducted with the help of a remote-controlled device. 

  He said the blast occurred outside the cantonment gates near a Srinagar shopping 

  mall. <br>

  <br>

  The army headquarters here said the attack was aimed at sabotaging an ongoing 

  Indian process to restore peace in occupied Kashmir. "In efforts to disrupt 

  and annul the ongoing peace negotiations, which are gaining momentum and strengthening 

  with each passing day, militants (Mujahideen) from an as yet unidentified group 

  detonated a car bomb," the army said in a statement. <br>

  <br>

  The Christmas blast is the second car bomb attack in the cantonment area this 

  year. In April, a Jaish-i-Mohammad suicide bomber detonated a car there, killing 

  seven soldiers and injuring several civilians. <br>

  <br>

  And militants of the pan-Islamic Lashkar-i-Taiba stormed the army headquarters 

  last month, killing four soldiers and three army officials. <br>

  <br>

  Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani on Monday blamed Pakistan for the attacks 

  during the Ramazan ceasefire. Violence is very much on in the (held) state. 

  The Lashkar-i-Taiba is still active but the group cannot function if Pakistan 

  in all honesty puts a stop to its activities. "Pakistan should talk to the militant 

  groups and stop the killing of innocent people," Advani said.-AFP
