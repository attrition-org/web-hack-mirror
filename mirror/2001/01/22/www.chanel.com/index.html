<title>STOP VIVISECTION AND FUR INDUSTRY</title>

<h4><center><u>Pain for Profit</u><br>
<br>
The fur ads we see in magazines and commercials portray fur coats as a symbol of elegance. But<br> these ads fail to show how the original owners of these coats met their gruesome deaths.<br> Approximately 3.5 million furbearing animals - raccoons, coyotes, bobcats, lynxes,<br> opossums, nutria, beavers, muskrats, otters, and others - are killed each year by trappers in the<br> United States. Another 2.7 million animals are raised on fur "farms." Despite the fur<br> industry's attempts to downplay the role of trapping in fur "production," it is estimated that<br> more than half of all fur garments come from trapped animals.<br>

<u>Jaws and Paws</u><br>
<br> 
There are various types of traps, including snares, box traps, and cage traps, but the leghold<br> trap is the most widely used. This simple but barbaric device has been banned in 63<br> countries, as well as in Florida, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Arizona. The European<br> Union plans to ban the importation of furs from countries that use leghold traps on December <br>31, 1995. However, the U.S. government is lobbying to weaken this regulation.<br>

<br><br>
When an animal steps on the leghold trap spring, the trap's jaws slam on the animal's limb. Dr.<br> Robert E. Cape explains that "if the trap is properly anchored, the captured animal will<br> struggle to get loose, mutilating the foot and causing deep, painful lacerations. Or the<br> animal will attempt escape by chewing or twisting off the trapped extremity. 10 to 12<br> hours after being captured, the animal is still in pain." After a prolonged time,<br> he explains, trapped animals "will suffer from exhaustion, since they expend such a great <br> amount ofenergy in attempting to escape. With exhaustion, the animal suffers from exposure,<br> frostbite, shock, and eventually death."<br>
<br>
It is estimated that up to one out of every four trapped animals escapes by chewing off his or<br> her own foot. If these animals do not die from blood loss, infection, or gangrene, they<br> will probably be killed by predators, hunters, or other traps. Victims of water-set<br> traps, including beavers and muskrats, can take up to 20 agonizing minutes to drown.<br>

<br><br>
Because many trapped animals are mutilated by predators before trappers return to claim their<br> bodies, pole traps are often used. A pole trap is a form of leghold trap that is set in a tree or<br> on a pole. Animals caught in these traps are hoisted into the air and left to hang by the<br> caught appendage until they die or the trapper arrives to kill them.<br> 
<br>
<u>The Fatal Finale</u><br> 
<br>
For animals who stay alive in the traps, further torture awaits them when the trappers return.<br> State regulations on how often trappers must check their traps vary from 24 hours to<br> one week, and four states have no regulations at all. Most state laws do not regulate the<br> methods of slaughter for animals found alive in traps. To avoid damaging the pelt,<br> trappers usually beat or stomp their victims to death. A common stomping method is "for the<br> trapper to stand on the animal's rib cage, concentrating his weight near the heart. He then<br> reaches down, takes the animal's hind legs in his hands, and yanks."<br>

<u>"Accidental" Victims</u><br> 
<br>
Every year hundreds of thousands of dogs, cats, birds, and other animals, including<br> endangered species, are "accidentally" crippled or killed by traps. Trappers call these animals<br> "trash kills" because they have no economic value.<br></h4>
