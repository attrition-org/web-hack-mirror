<p>just hacked thes site to show the world that its very unsecure... a 15
years old boy(me) can hack a goverment computer.</p>

<p>a lite tip: every one who thinks to put a site on the net first go to
some security advisers <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com">security
focus</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"> and protect your site</p>

<p>greets to: securityfocus, packetstorm, and all my frends.</p>
