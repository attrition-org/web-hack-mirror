<br>
<CENTER>A point of view .. wrote by a non-kashmiris but yet a supporter for Kashmir cause</CENTER>
<CENTER>Kashmir is NOT an Integral Part of India ..</CENTER>
<CENTER> well .. searching all related documents about history of Kashmir i can say few things ..</CENTER>
<CENTER>As peer international law as is evident from the verious U.N resolutions Kashmir is a disputed teritory occupied forcefully by India</CENTER>
<CENTER>The Indian leaders who had initially accepted U.N positions had promised to abide by it</CENTER>
<CENTER>Hence it is quite obvious that India is ilegally occupying the State of Jammu & Kashmir, in defiance to thee International Law</CENTER>
<br>
<CENTER>But how we already know .. for India the State of Kashmir is not a precedent .. let's remember about Hyderabad in 1947 </CENTER>
<CENTER>What followed ?.. Junagadh formally part of Pakistan that was invaded and annexed despite protests of Pakistan</CENTER>
<CENTER>Next was?.. The Portuguese colony of Goa  .. and .. the independent Kingdom of Sikkim..and in 1971 the East Pakistani province of East Bengal</CENTER>
<CENTER>Without talking about thee atomic bomb right next to the Pakistani border for "peaceful purposes"</CENTER>
<br>
<CENTER>What more?.. let's remember what Jawaharlal Nehru said in Indian Parliament in June 16 1952 </CENTER>
<CENTER>"If after a proper plebiscite the people of Kashmir said , we don't want with India , we are commited to accept it eveen thought it might pain"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"WE WILL NOT SEND AN ARMY AGAINST THEM"</CENTER>
<br>
<CENTER>Then what the fuck is happening there ?.. .. from June 16 1952 till now January 2001 . geeze .. let's do sumthin .. </CENTER>
<CENTER>Kids without parents and parents without kids .. kids that don't know what is a Christmas present .. or kids sleeping on the streets</CENTER>
<CENTER>OMG .. where's the JUSTICE .. where are the human rights ?..</CENTER>
<CENTER>GForce Pakistan stands UP against all injustice .. Kashmir is a stringent problem .. also not the only one .. Palestine is another one</CENTER>
<CENTER>Why we are not defacing only Indian sites ?.. because the big World PoliceMan .. i mean U.S.A .. is not involving .. why ? </CENTER>
<CENTER>INTERESTS .. or NON-INTERESTS .. Kuwait was a good point for U.S.A .. the oil from Kuwait was and is their point .. what about Kashmir?</CENTER>
<CENTER>If is nothing to take then is nothing to make... their politic is simple .. give me what i want and i''ll give you my support ..</CENTER>
<CENTER>So .. this Portland/Oregon website/machine has been hacked/defaced by GForce Pakistan to ring a bell (again) about what USA can do and is not doing</CENTER>
<CENTER>Regarding this website content and independent from what i wrote above .. www.networkmercenaries.com is a Unix system consulting group</CENTER>
<CENTER>I just got their point about what is SECURITY but this is not so important</CENTER>
