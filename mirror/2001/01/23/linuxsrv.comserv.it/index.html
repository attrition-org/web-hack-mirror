  <p>This is for the media, before they begin labeling us as malicious hacktivists. 
  </p>
  <p>With our forays into the cyberspace continues, the media are beginning to 
    hand us labels and <br>
    make their own conclusions on the how and the ways we do this. This is our 
    answer. By the time <br>
    you've read this, details pretaining to the Ivioli.com site would be known 
    to the public. This is penetrated<br>
    by another hacktivist group and is aimed to embarass and humiliate Ivoli.com 
    chief executive <br>
    officer Rama Krishnan on his observations in the local media about our exploits 
    into waumail.com. <br>
    We humbly apologize for the defacement even tought it is not our intent to 
    embarass or humiliate <br>
    any person(s) or group(s). However we share the same school of thought even 
    tough <br>
    our methods differ. Salutes goes out to MyNet crew. </p>
  <p>It is in our belief that after the first atricle that appeared in the <i><b>New 
    Sunday Times of 14th January 2001</b></i> <br>
    and the following report which appeared in <i><b>The Star, 20th of January 
    2001</b></i>, we have succeeded<br>
    in making our point known to the media. The point, which we hereby re-iterate 
    here, <br>
    is the simple fact that we, as the Malaysian internet users, simply lack the 
    proper approach into internet security <br>
    measures. We are still too proud and arrogant to admit that we are too far 
    behind in this particular <br>
    field and it allowed foreigners to simply waltz into our servers in any way 
    they choose. </p>
  <p>For the record, all the websites defaced are in no way have any data removed 
    or hardware <br>
    damaged in the process. In fact, we actually patched the very same bugs that 
    we used to gain <br>
    access so to prevent anyone else to penetrate the system. They are no deleted 
    files, they are <br>
    only renamed to avoid the webmaster from doing any unnecessary work. </p>

  <font color="#FF0000">Special greets to: MyCert and Mimos Berhad</font> <br>
  Also for the record, we do not have any paper qualifications or certifications 
  from any institutions in <br>
  any computer related fields yet we choose to expose this because the bigwigs 
  in <font color="#FF0000">MyCERT and Mimos <br>
  Berhad</font> refuse to admit of their own shortcomings. The society that we 
  live in the 21 century stresses <br>
  too much on these paper qualifications. In our own way, this is what we say 
  to them, up yours! <br>
  Any more questions? <br>
