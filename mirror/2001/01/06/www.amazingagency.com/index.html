    <font size=4><b>Suspect in Red Fort attack shot dead </b></font>
  </center>
  <p><br>
    NEW DELHI, Dec 26: The New Delhi police said on Tuesday they had shot dead 
    a Muslim militant suspected of being involved in the assault on the Red Fort. 
    <br>
    <br>
    "An encounter took place early this morning ... in which one militant was 
    killed and another nabbed in the capital's south district," an official of 
    the Delhi police counter-insurgency cell told AFP. <br>
    <br>
    The shootout took place at 5:40am (0010 GMT) during a raid on a residential 
    area in south Delhi, the official said, adding that police had recovered an 
    AK-47 rifle, two grenades and some ammunition. <br>
    <br>
    The dead militant was identified as Abu Shawal and his captured comrade as 
    Ashaf Ali, who reportedly gave police the names of six more people involved 
    in the Red Fort attack on Friday night. Both men were believed to be Pakistani 
    nationals. <br>
    <br>
    Lashker-i-Taiba - a militant group operating in Occupied Kashmir - claimed 
    responsibility for Friday's attack, in which three people, including two army 
    personnel were killed. <br>
    <br>
    The Red Fort houses an army garrison and interrogation center. A high-level 
    joint police and army probe has been ordered into the security lapse that 
    allowed the armed militants to approach undetected. More than 1,000 policemen, 
    soldiers and military intelligence officials on Tuesday were still carrying 
    out house-to-house searches in a two-kilometer radius from the fort. <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, the Laskher-i-Taiba issued a press release on Tuesday, threatening 
    a suicide attack against the offices of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari 
    Vajpayee. "Our Mujahideen will storm Vajpayee's office and carry out a fidayeen 
    (suicide) attack there," the Lashker statement said. "If our cadres can force 
    an entry into Delhi's Red Fort, it will not be an uphill task to barge into 
    Mr Vajpayees's office." <br>
    <br>
    Lashkar was among the first militant groups to reject the unilateral Indian 
    army ceasefire in Kashmir which was ordered by Prime Minister Vajpayee and 
    came into force at midnight Nov 27. <br>
    <br>
    Last week, Vajpayee extended the cease-fire for another four weeks. <br>
    <br>
    "The government should leave the politics of cease-fire and withdraw its troops 
    from Kashmir," the Lashker release said. "If India fails to withdraw its troops 
    we will intensify our fidayeen attacks within India and force it to pull out 
    its troops." <br>
    <br>
    Observers say the recent attacks on high-profile targets were aimed at delivering 
    a clear message that hard-line militant outfits will not be sidelined by the 
    cease-fire process. <br>

    THREAT TO VAJPAYEE: The Lashker-i-Taiba threatened on Tuesday a suicide attack 
    against the offices of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in New Delhi. 
    "Our mujahideen, Allah willing, will storm Vajpayee's office and carry out 
    a Fidayeen (suicide) attack there," the Lashker said in a one-page Urdu press 
    release. "If our cadres can force an entry into Delhi's Red Fort, it will 
    not be an uphill task to barge into Mr Vajpayee's office," the statement said.

    <br>
    Last week, Prime Minister Vajpayee extended the cease-fire for another four

    its troops from (held) Kashmir," the Lashker press release said. "If India 
    fails to withdraw its troops we will intensify our Fidayeen attacks within 
    India and force it to pull out its troops," it added.-AFP
