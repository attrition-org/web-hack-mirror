            <p> - Information Times and Pakistan News Service, the international 
              media leaders in news-info-ideas, expose Zee TV's corruption, fraud 
              and deception with documentary and visible evidence. 
            <p> - Watch PTV-PNS video which exposes India's Zee TV's malicious 
              propaganda against Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). 
              Internet: 
            <p> PTV Special Report Exposes Zee TV's Big Lies (Transcript) 
            <p> True to its traditions of baseless allegations and false reporting, 
              the Indian Television channel "Zee News" recently aired a misleading 
              report, in which it was alleged that the recent press conference 
              of Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, Syed Salahuddin, was 
              conducted under the supervision of three officers of Pakistan's 
              Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Who are the individuals highlighted 
              by Zee TV as ISI officers? What is their real identity? Here is 
              a report by Pakistan Television (PTV) Mati Ullah Jan. 
            <p> Zee News without mentioning the name of this individual has reported 
              that he is an Indonesian Militant. In fact, this gentleman is Sheikh 
              Muhammad Talha who is a Karachi-based businessman. 
            <p> Sheikh Muhammad Talha: 
            <p> "My name is Sheikh Muhammad Talha. I belong to Karachi where I 
              am doing business for the last eighteen years. I am running a travel 
              agency for the last four years in Karachi. Here is my visiting card 
              and my passport which clearly shows that I am a businessman. A few 
              days ago, I had come to Islamabad and learnt through newspapers 
              that the Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, Syed Salahuddin, 
              is holding a press conference. I was very anxious to attend the 
              same. I was shocked to hear that Zee News has declared me as an 
              Indonesian national. This clearly shows the truth about India's 
              involvement in baseless propaganda against Pakistan." 
            <p> This individual has been reported as Major Tariq of ISI, although 
              he is the Senior News Producer of International News Agency APTN, 
              Dilshad Khan. 
            <p> Dilshad Khan: 
            <p> "Last night I saw a program on Zee TV that was about ISI. I was 
              horrified to see that I was identified as one Major Tariq of ISI, 
              though I am working as a journalist for the last fourteen years 
              and currently am the correspondent of American News Agency, APTN, 
              which is the largest news agency in the world." 
            <p> Question: What were you doing there when this picture was taken? 
            <p> Answer: "It is obvious (that) I am a journalist like you and it 
              is our job to cover such events. It was a big story, the world was 
              waiting for it and I was there to cover it. I was following Mr. 
              Salahuddin as he entered (the press conference area), I was shocked 
              to see that the frame, freezed (at my face) and I posed as Major 
              Tariq of ISI." 
            <p> The poor fellow mentioned as the Brigadier of ISI is actually 
              a waiter of the hotel where Syed Salahuddin held the press conference. 
            <p> Aslam is serving the hotel for a long time and it is his duty 
              to make the guests comfortable. 
            <p> Muhammad Aslam: 
            <p> "Muhammad Aslam is my name. I work here as a senior waiter. I 
              have been working here for the last eleven years. When Mr. Salahuddin 
              arrived (for the press conference) I helped him to take his seat, 
              placed water in front of him and then left the stage." 
            <p> Question: What are your duties when a function is held or a guest 
              arrives? 
            <p> Answer: "I welcome the guests, look after their needs, help them 
              to take their seats and ask for any other assistance." 
            <p> So this is Zee's Inside Story on ISI. In fact, this is a part 
              of crude and baseless propaganda campaign directed towards Pakistan. 
              This is pack of lies and baseless allegations. This is a sequel 
              to Indian Media's unsuccessful propaganda campaign, which it started 
              against Pakistan when Indian Airlines aircraft was hijacked. The 
              Facts, Truth and Lies lay bare before you and you are the better 
              judge. 
            <p> Mati Ullah Jan, Pakistan Television News, Islamabad, Pakistan.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Indian's life made misrible 
  by ISI (ROFL) <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With their current "anti 
  Pakistan and their agencies" hysteria of the Indian media they want you to believe 
  that every aspect of their life is infiltrated by ISI. Having thought about 
  it carefully I came to the conclusion that yes maybe they are right. The following 
  is an example of how an ordinary Indian's day is disrupted by ISI: - </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He wakes up early in the 
  morning and stumbles across the room to watch the sun rise, but there are clouds 
  in the sky blocking his view. Obviously ISI are the culprits as they want him 
  to feel depressed, so they sent clouds over India at sun rise. - He than makes 
  his way to the bathroom and starts shaving. What's this, his face gets cut by 
  the blade. Surely ISI must have planted a rogue blade in his bathroom in order 
  to make his life miserable early in the morning. - Having survived two assaults 
  by this terrorist organisation he leaves for work and asks his wife to lock 
  all the doors and baricade herself in the house just in case there is an ISI 
  agent around who might sneak into the house and sabotage it. - </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He than discovers another 
  nefarious plot by the notorious ISI --- all the public transport whether they 
  be buses or trains are overflowing with commuters. Obviously these commuters 
  are ISI plants to stop him from getting to his workplace and contributing to 
  the welfare of his country. - He reaches his workplace after a great effort 
  and discovers that ISI has struck again. There is no elctricity and therfore 
  he cannot carry out his duties. Another clever plot by ISI to sabotage his great 
  nation. - He staggers to lunch during the afternoon but feels drowsy after the 
  meal. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wants to sleep instead of 
  work. What did the ISI put in his food? - On the way back he discovers that 
  the commuter conspiracy is again at work. - Finally he arrives home, his children 
  give him their school report. What, they are not doing well at school. Realises 
  that ISI has infiltrated the education system as well and now are out to destroy 
  the education of the children by sending such reports to parents. - Night falls, 
  he goes to bed, hears a thump outside his bedroom, looks out of the bedroom 
  window ----- ISI ----- life goes on. ....</font></p>

<p> Note,</p>
<p> pakgov.org was defaced earlier this month, it was India's 'RAW' agent's lame 
  attempt to impersonate a Pakistani government website. I have a small mesage 
  for you lame morons, 'next time you card a domain to deface, make sure you run 
  a spell checker on the content you type, and note down the date of registeration...</p>
