    ... The Varna University of Medicine was founded in 1961 as Higher Medical 
    Institute of Varna. The date October 1, 1961 when the first students from 
    the third course crossed the threshold of the first Higher School of Medicine 
    in North-Eastern Bulgaria is considered its birthday. The creation of the 
    third higher medical school in Bulgaria meets the increasing public requirements 
    of highly qualified medical staff and specialized physician's care for the 
    population of this region of the country. In 1965 the first 78 physicians 
    graduated. All main departments and clinics were established during the first 
    three years. Initially, use was made of the existing clinical basis of the 
    District Hospital and City Hospital of Varna. Along with the extention of 
    the Institute, the building of new hospitals was carried out, additional beds 
    were provided not only for educational purposes but also to meet the needs 
    of health care in North-Eastern Bulgaria. Structurally, the departments, clinics, 
    and laboratories were upgraded in order to correspond to the criteria and 
    requirements of contemporary medical science and practice. The basis for fundamental 
    sciences education and the clinical hospital basis has been constantly enlarged 
    and enriched. Nowadays the process of education is conducted in the buildings 
    of the Varna University Hospital, of the Surgical, Psychiatric, Dermato-Venereal, 
    Obstetric-Gynaecologic, Ophthalmic, Infectious and some other hospitals as 
    well. Many recognized specialists work with the latest equipment for diagnostic 
    and therapeutic purposes there. In 1993/94 the specialty of management in 
    public health and social care was introduced. In 1995 the Higher Medical Institute 
    of Varna was approved as the Varna University of Medicine. Over 6400 students 
    have graduated with medical diploma, including 620 foreigners from 45 countries 
    in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. The number of foreign postgraduates 
    already reaches up to 110. The Varna University of Medicine is an authoritative 
    centre for teaching-educational, research and diagnostic-therapeutic activities 
    with undoubted contribution to the progress of medical science and education.
