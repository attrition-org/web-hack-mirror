<p><font size="4">EDUCATION MEDICINE Full-time medical students only can be admitted 
  to the University. The course of academic studies covers 6 years for medicine. 
  It consists of 10 semesters and 10 months of clinical practice (internship). 
  The teaching process is conducted in 35 departments and 44 clinics staffed with 
  118 professors and associate professors as well as with 322 assistants and lecturers. 
  Students' education is performed through lectures, seminars and laboratory practice. 
  It is group-based as groups count between 8 and 10 students. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4">PRE-CLINICAL PERIOD During the pre-clinical period (I-IV semester) 
  fundamental biomedical sciences such as biology, biophysics, biochemistry, anatomy 
  and histology, physiology, etc. are studied. The students get acquainted with 
  the structure and function of the human body, perform their first experiments 
  on laboratory animals, and enrich their knowledge in medical chemistry and medical 
  physics as a basis for their education in biochemistry and biophysics. Multimedia 
  computer language laboratories for foreign language training in English, French, 
  German and Bulgarian using the latest CALL software are used. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4">PROPAEDEUTIC PERIOD The propaedeutic period (V-VI semester) 
  aims at making students familiar with the basic principles of origin and development 
  of the pathological process and the diseases, with the methods of patient's 
  examination as well as with the clinical features of the most common diseases. 
  The main theoretical and applied biomedical disciplines such as pathological 
  anatomy, pathological physiology, propaedeutics of internal medicine and surgery, 
  pharmacology and toxicology, medical statistics, etc. are studied. The students 
  already experiment confidently on laboratory animals and face the patient in 
  a hospital environment for the first time. The teaching of the specific clinical 
  thinking of future physicians and researchers starts at the patient's bed. The 
  link between the propaedeutic and clinical periods is realized through the education 
  of some disciplines such as roentgenology and radiology, medical psychology, 
  social medicine, etc.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4"> CLINICAL PERIOD The clinical teaching (VII-X semester) maintains 
  an orientation towards an immediate involvement with patients. The theoretical 
  course aims at creating skills for argumented diagnostic and therapeutic thinking 
  and for analysis and synthesis of the large amount of scientific information 
  collected during the investigation and treatment of the patient. At that cause-consequence 
  relations of single diseases in the concrete case are looked for. Besides the 
  students learn jow to handle the most-contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic 
  equipment available in the departments and clinics. All main clinical disciplines 
  are studied. The students are educated as carriers of a high professional morals, 
  fellow-feeling, and humane attitude towards the suffering patient and his relatives.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4">INTERNSHIP The internship (10 months) provides students - trainee-doctors 
  the opportunity to acquire a more complete idea of the whole diagnostic, therapeutic 
  and preventive activities in the hospital and polyclinics. They participate 
  together with the attending doctors in the various forms of patient's care such 
  as doctor's visits, performance of different diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, 
  consultations, etc. At that they have to follow-up the status of concrete patients 
  for a period of several weeks - from admission to the clinic to discharge. Together 
  with that they prepare abstracts devoted to actual topics of the corresponding 
  diseases, participate in colloquia, seminars, presentations of new-drug manufacturer 
  firms, etc. In the Varna University of Medicine, an internship in an optional 
  subject is carried out, too, enabling a better preparation of trainee-doctors 
  for their future work. </font></p>
<hr>
<p> <font size="4">STUDETS who have successfully passed their state qualification 
  examinations in the specialty of medicine obtain a diploma according to an established 
  standard for completed medical university studies with an education-qualification 
  of master's degree and are awarded the professional qualification of "physician". 
  Students who have successfully completed their university studies in health 
  management obtain a M.A. diploma with an education-qualification of master's 
  degree. All the students who have completed their university studies obtain 
  their diploma at an official ceremony in an solemn setting facing their lecturers, 
  colleagues, parents and the public of the city of Varna. They swear by the Hippocratic 
  oath and start their way at the service of the greatest welfare - the human 
  health.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="4">The training is full-time and extramural. This specialty faces 
  the new needs of up-to-date health care management of institutions of different 
  type. The curriculum is elaborated in agreement with the international experience 
  of training university graduates in management in public health and the social 
  sphere. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4">The course of academic studies in public health management includes 
  9 semesters, one-month specialised pre-graduation practice and defence of a 
  M.A. thesis. Students' education is conducted through lectures, seminars, and 
  practical exercises. The students independently prepare their course papers. 
  </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4">The purpose of the training consists in the acquisition of integrated 
  knowledge and practical skills for independent posing and solving the specific 
  administrative and business problems related to the reconstruction of the health-care 
  and social system in our country as well as for formation and management of 
  health-care and social funds, hospital banks, etc. The problems of the immediate
