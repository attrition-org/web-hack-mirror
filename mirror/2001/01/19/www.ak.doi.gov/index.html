    <td width="100%">Did anybody said... &quot;Hack the planet&quot; ? yeaaah... Hack the
    motha'fuckin planet... Hack governments all over the world... hack them all... Powered by
    beer, whisky, vodka and wine Pentaguard is here to hit the al those fancy .gov/.mil
    servers once again... Why ? Well... who needs them anyway ? We don't... they don't have
    mp3's, they don't have porn, they don't have warez, they don't have 0-day exploits so
    they're totally unusefull... (actually not that unusefull, on one of the vulnerable
    servers I found emergency contraception and birth control methods... that site wasn't
    defaced... :)))...<br><br>
So, we sugest... make these fuckin sites usefull... they have bandwith, they have enough storing space... put warez on them, make a few free porn sites, fill them with mp3's... USE them... btw, why can't I order beer from .gov sites ? or whisky ? These sites really suck... we should have deleted them... but... anyway... we saved all the original main, pages with the .bak extension (we're good guys, aren't we ?)... We haven't deleted anything (oh, of course the logs were a little bit modified... :)))... Ok, so now let's get to some personal messages:<br><br>
