<br>
I'll admit.
<br>
This girl owns my heart.
<br>
<br>
-----------------------
<br>
Baby please try to forgive me
<br>
Stay here don't put out the glow
<br>
Hold me now, don't bother
<br>
If every minute it makes me weaker
<br>
You can save me from the man that I've become
<br>
Oh yeah
<br>
<br>
Lookin' back on the things I've done
<br>
I was trying to be someone
<br>
Play my part & kept ya in the dark
<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
<br>
<br>
Sadness is beautiful
<br>
Loniness is tragical
<br>
So help me, I can't win this war, oh no
<br>
Touch me now, don't bother
<br>
If every second it makes me weaker
<br>
You can save me from the man I've become
<br>
<br>
I'm here with my confession
<br>
Got nothing to hide no more
<br>
I don't know where to start
<br>
But to show you the shape of my heart
<br>
<br>
I'm looking back on things I've done
<br>
I never wanna play the same old part
<br>
Keep you in the dark
<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
<br>
<br>
Show you the shape of my heart 
<br>

<br>
Kica, do you remember when you said this is our song?
<br>
I remember. I never will forget this. I love you.
<br>
Since our first kiss, you conquered me.
<br>
<br>
I wanted can give the world for YOU! 
<br>
While this doesn't happen, I only can say I love you. 
<br>
<br>
Hey babe.
