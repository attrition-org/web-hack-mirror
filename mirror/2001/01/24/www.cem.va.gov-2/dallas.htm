  On May 12, 2000, the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery was dedicated as the 118th
  national cemetery within the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery
  Administration.  Burial operations began on May 15.<p>
  The new 638-acre cemetery will serve more than 460,000 veterans and their families in 
  north-central Texas.<p>
  In 1987, VA identified the Dallas-Fort Worth area as one of the ten areas of the country
  most in need of burial space for veterans based on veteran populations.<p>
  An Environmental Impact Statement was prepared in 1991 and the Secretary of Veterans
  Affairs formally selected a site near Mountain Creek Lake, between Dallas and Fort Worth,
  in 1992.<p>
  A contract to develop the master plan for the new cemetery was awarded to Carter & Burgess,
  Inc. in 1994.<p>
  A $12.7 million construction contract was awarded to Incore Incorporated of San Antonio,
  Texas, in October 1997.  Construction has begun and the cemetery is expected to open in
  2000.<p>
  When the 638-acre cemetery site is fully developed it will provide 280,000 burial spaces.
  Initial construction will develop approximately 110 acres, including:<p>
  <ul>
     <li>12,000 gravesites, including 2,000 lawn crypts and 2,200 
         columbaria and garden niches for cremated remains;<br>
     <li>Cemetery entrance area and public information center; memorial
	 walkway;<br>
     <li>Two committal service shelters;<br>
     <li>Flag/assembly area with lake;<br>
     <li>Administration/maintenance complex; and,<br>
     <li>Roadways, utilities and landscaping.<p>
   </ul>
  Jimmy Adamson was selected as Dallas-Fort Worth’s director in April 1998.<p>
