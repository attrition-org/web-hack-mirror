  On September 10, 2000, Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery was dedicated as the 119th 
  national cemetery within the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration.  
  Burial operations began on June 19, 2000. <p>
  In 1987, VA identified the Cleveland area as one of ten areas of the country most in need of burial 
  space for veterans based on veteran populations.  An Environmental Impact Statement was prepared in 
  1992 and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs formally selected a 274-acre site in Guilford Township 
  45 miles south of Cleveland in Medina County near the town of Rittman in January 1993.<p>
  A contract to develop the master plan was awarded to William Behnke Associates, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, 
  in September 1994.  This firm completed the construction contract documents in April 1998.  An $11.1 
  million construction contact was awarded to Welty Building Company of Akron, Ohio, in June 1998.  <p>
  Jeffrey L. Teas was selected as the cemetery's director in September 1998.<p>
  On May 28, 2000, a consecration service was held by the cemetery staff with representives of several 
  faiths participating.<p>
  The new national cemetery will serve more than 540,000 veterans and their families in northeast Ohio. When 
  the 274-acre cemetery site is fully developed it will provide 106,000 burial spaces.  Initial 
  construction will develop approximately 65 acres, including:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>15,900 full-casket gravesites and 3,000 sites for cremated remains (including columbaria);<br>
    <li>cemetery entrance area;<br>
    <li>administration/maintenance complex;<br>
    <li>two committal service shelters; and,<br>
    <li>roadways, landscaping, utilities and irrigation.<p>
  </ul>
