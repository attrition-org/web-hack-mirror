  In the summer of 1862, thousands had already died in the second summer of
  a terrible war that few believed would last more than several months.  On 
  July 17, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the President to purchase
  "cemetery grounds" to be used as national cemeteries "for soldiers who 
  shall have died in the service of the country."
  <p>
  Fourteen cemeteries were established that year, including one in the 
  sleepy Maryland town of Sharpsburg where 4,476 Union soldiers were laid
  to rest after a day of slaughter known as the Battle of Antietam.  (By 
  comparison, approximately 3,000 Americans, British and Canadians died on
  June 6, 1944, in the invasion of Normandy.)

  Soon after the war ended, Army crews scoured the countryside to locate the
  remains of Union soldiers who died in battle.  They were reinterred with 
  honor in  national cemeteries.  By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000
  Union dead had been buried in 73 national cemeteries.  Most were located 
  in the Southeast, near the battlefields and campgrounds of the Civil War.
  Tragically, however, the identities of nearly half of the Union soldiers 
  buried in national cemeteries are unknown.

  It was in 1873 that all honorably discharged veterans became eligible for 
  burial in national cemeteries.  The National Cemetery Administration has evolved 
  slowly since the initial period of great challenge associated with the 
  Civil War.
  <p>
  New national cemeteries were established in the 1930s to serve veterans 
  living in metropolitan areas such as New York, Baltimore, Minneapolis, 
  San Diego, San Francisco and San Antonio.  In 1973, Congress transferred
  82 national cemeteries from the Department of the Army to the Veterans 
  Administration, now the <a href="http://www.va.gov">
  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</a>. Joining with 21 VA veterans 
  cemeteries located at hospitals and nursing homes, the National Cemetery
  System, now the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), comprised 103 cemeteries after the transfer.

  Today, more than 130 years after the first national cemeteries were 
  established, the National Cemetery Administration is responsible for 119 national
  cemeteries in 39 states (and Puerto Rico) as well as 33 soldiers' lots and 
  monument sites.  More than two million Americans, including veterans of 
  every war and conflict - from the Revolutionary War to the Persian Gulf -
  are honored by burial in VA’s national cemeteries.  Nearly 14,000 acres
  of land from Hawaii to Maine, and from Alaska to Puerto Rico are devoted 
  to the memorialization of those who served this grateful Nation.
