  <b>REIMBURSEMENT OF BURIAL EXPENSES</b><p>
  VA will pay a burial allowance up to $1,500 if the veteran’s death is service-connected.  In some 
  instances, VA also will pay the cost of transporting the remains of a service-disabled veteran to 
  the national cemetery nearest the home of the deceased that has available gravesites.  In such cases,
  the person who bore the veteran’s burial expense may claim reimbursement from VA.<p>
  VA will pay a $300 burial and funeral expense allowance for veterans who, at the time of death, were
  entitled to receive pension or compensation or would have been entitled to compensation but for receipt
  of military retirement pay.  Eligibility also may be established when death occurs in a VA facility, a 
  nursing home under VA contact or a state nursing home.  Additional costs of transportation of the remains
  may be paid.  There is no time limit for filing reimbursement claims of service-connected deaths.  In other 
  deaths, claims must be filed within two years after permanent burial or cremation.<p>
  VA will pay a $150 plot allowance when a veteran is not buried in a cemetery that is under U.S. government
  jurisdiction under the following circumstances: the veteran was discharged from active duty because of 
  disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; the veteran was in receipt of compensation or 
  pension or would have been except for receiving military retired pay; or the veteran died in a VA facility.
  The $150 plot allowance may be paid to the state if a veteran is buried without charge for the cost of a 
  plot or interment in a state-owned cemetery reserved solely for veteran burials.  Burial expenses paid by 
  the deceased’s employer or a state agency will not be reimbursed.  For information on monetary benefits,
  call 1-800-827-1000.<p>
