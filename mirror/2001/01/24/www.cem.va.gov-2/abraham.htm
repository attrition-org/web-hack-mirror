  On October 3, 1999, Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery was dedicated as the 117th national
  cemetery within the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration.
  Burial operations began on October 12.<p>
  The new 982-acre cemetery will serve approximately one million veterans in the Chicago
  metropolitan area.<p>
  In 1987, VA identified the Chicago area as first among ten areas of the country most in
  need of burial space for veterans based on veteran populations.<p>
  The <a href="http://www.va.gov">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</a>
  (VA) identified the site, known as Hoff Woods, at the Joliet Army 
  Ammunition Plant and prepared an Environmental Impact Statement in 
  1994.  Soon after, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs approved the site 
  for a new national cemetery. In 1996, the National Defense 
  Authorization Act included the transfer of 982 acres from the 
  U.S. Department of the Army to VA for the cemetery.<p>
  A contract to design the new cemetery was awarded to Harry Weese and 
  Associates of Chicago in 1995.  A $17 million construction contract 
  was awarded to Bouie Construction of Joliet, Ill., in October 1997.<p>
  When the 982-acre cemetery site is fully developed it will provide 400,000
  burial spaces.  Initial construction developed approximately 150 acres including:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>25,000 gravesites, 2,000 lawn crypts, 3,000 columbaria niches and 2,300 garden niches for cremated 
        remains;<br>
    <li>Cemetery entrance area and public information center;<br>
    <li>Three Committal service shelters;<br>
    <li>Assembly area and memorial walkway;<br>
    <li>Administration/maintenance complex; and,<br>
    <li>Roadways and landscaping.<p>
  </ul>

  Billy Murphy was selected as the cemetery’s director in June 1998.<p>
  <b>The Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery is named after the 16th President of the United States and 
     founder of National Cemeteries (July 17, 1862).  President Lincoln's legacy is especially important 
     to the people of Illinois, where he worked and lived.  He is buried in the Oak Ridge Cemetery near the State 
     Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, where many additional sites of historical interest are located. </b><p>
