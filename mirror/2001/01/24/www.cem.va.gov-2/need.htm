<center><b>Requests for burial in a <a href="http://www.va.gov">
Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) national cemetery cannot be 
   made via the Internet.</b><p>
</center>
<ul>
   No special forms are required when requesting burial in a VA national
   cemetery.  The person making burial arrangements should have their funeral home contact the
   national cemetery in which burial is desired at the time of need.  
   Scheduling can be done seven days a week for interments on Mondays 
   through Fridays.<p>
   If possible, the following information concerning the deceased should
   be provided when the cemetery is first contacted:<p>
   <ul>
     <li>Full name and military rank;<br>
     <li>Branch of service;<br>
     <li>Social security number;<br>
     <li>Service number;<br>
     <li> VA claim number, if applicable;<br>
     <li>Date and place of birth;<br>
     <li>Date and place of death;<br>
     <li>Date of retirement or last separation from active duty; and,<br>
     <li><a href="http://www.nara.gov/regional/mprsf180.html">Copy of 
         any military separation documents</a>, such as the Department 
         of Defense Form 214 (DD-214).<p>
   </ul>
   The discharge documents must specify active military duty and show 
   that release from active duty was under other than dishonorable
   conditions.<p>
   Viewing facilities are not available and funeral services cannot be 
   held at VA national cemeteries, but a final committal service may be 
   performed.  For safety reasons, these committal services are held in
   committal shelters located away from the gravesite.  Burial will take
   place following the committal service.<p>
</ul>

<p><br>
<ul>
   Floral arrangements may accompany the casket or urn from the 
   committal shelter and will be placed on the grave after burial.<p>
   A headstone or marker will be ordered by cemetery personnel upon 
   inscription approval by the next of kin and a burial flag will be 
   provided.<p>
   Upright headstones are standard in most national cemeteries, however, 
   some have both upright headstone and flat marker sections.  Be sure 
   to discuss these options with the cemetery director prior to burial.<p>
   <a name="before"></a>
   The same procedures are followed if the veteran's eligible spouse or
   dependent predeceases the veteran.  In most cases, one gravesite is 
   provided for the burial of all eligible family members and a single 
   headstone or marker is provided.  When both spouses are veterans, two
   gravesites and two headstones or markers may be provided if requested.<p>
   <a href="mhg.htm">Military honors</a> are not provided by the national
   cemetery.  These honors must be arranged in advance by the family or 
   their representative with groups that provide the honors.<p>
