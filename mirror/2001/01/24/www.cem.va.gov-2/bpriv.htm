<ul>
   You may want to ask the following questions when preparing for burial
   in a private cemetery:<p>
   <ul>
     <li>When responding to an offer of a "free" gravesite for veterans,
         ask if there is a requirement to purchase an additional 
         gravesite.<p>
     <li>If an additional gravesite is required, where will it be located
         and what the cost is?<p>
     <li> What type of trust fund does the cemetery have to protect 
          buyers?<p>
     <li> Ask if there are restrictions on the type of headstone or 
          marker that can be used to mark the grave.<p>
     <li> Does the cemetery require a special marker base to be purchased
          prior to ordering a free government marker for a veteran's 
          grave?<p>
     <li> Is there an additional cost for the placement, setting or care
          of a free government headstone or marker?  Is it more than if 
          a private headstone or marker is purchased?<p>
     <li> Is an outside container (usually called a "vault" or "grave 
          liner") required and how much does it cost?<p>
     <li> Know what you are receiving and what is required by the 
          company and have them put it in writing prior to burial.<p>
   </ul>
   We suggest that if burial will be in a private cemetery and a 
   Government headstone or marker will be requested for the veteran’s 
   grave, that the family complete <a href="http://www.cem.va.gov/hm.htm">
   VA Form 40-1330, <i>Application for Standard Government Headstone or 
   Marker for Installation in a Private or State Veterans’ Cemetery</i></a>,
   in advance and place it with the veteran’s military discharge papers 
   for use at the time of need.<p>
   Only an eligible veteran may receive a Government-provided headstone 
   or marker for placement in a private cemetery.  Veteran’s spouses and
   dependent children are not eligible.<p>
