Remains buried in the old post cemetery were moved to Ft. McPherson 
National Cemetery when the Army abandoned the post in 1987.  In 1906, 
the cemetery was reactivated when the U.S. Navy established a 
tuberculosis hospital for sailors and marines at the site.  In 1922, 
the Veterans Bureau (a predecessor of VA) assumed operation of the Fort 
Lyon Hospital and Cemetery.<p>

(7) Wood Cemetery was established on the grounds of the Northwest Branch
National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers and Dayton was established
on the grounds of the Asylum's Central Branch.  The Veterans 
Administration assumed administration of both the facility and cemetery 
in 1930.  It did not become a national cemetery until 1973, when VA 
assumed responsibility for the National Cemetery Administration.<p>

(8) Administered by the Veterans Administration in 1973 when national 
cemeteries administered by the Army were transferred to VA.  Became 
national cemeteries after that date although they were established 
earlier, most on the grounds of national homes or asylums for disabled 
soldiers and sailors.<p>

(9) Previously an Army post cemetery, reserved for active duty military
personnel and their families.<p>

(10) National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona was established as a State 
Veterans Cemetery in 1979.  It was transferred to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs in 1989 and became a national cemetery.<p>

(11) The site of Congressional Cemetery was first set aside as a burial 
ground by the Vestry of Christ  Church in 1808.  In 1817, the church 
reserved 100 gravesites for the interment of members of Congress.  
Today, NCA is responsible for 469 gravesites in the cemetery.  In total, 
there are 806 government-owned sites.  There are 168 Cenotaphs in the 
cemetery that were used to memorialize congressmen who died in office.  
There are nine Native American Delegate Members buried in the cemetery who died 
while representing their tribes on delegations to Washington.  There 
are 45 Confederate soldiers buried there as well.<p>
