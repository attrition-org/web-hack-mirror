  Tahoma National Cemetery, dedicated September 26, 1997, serves more 
  than 410,000 veterans and their families in the Seattle, Washington 
  area.<p>
  A 160-acre parcel of land next to Tahoma High School in Maple Valley
  was acquired from the Washington Department of Natural Resources for 
  $1.6 million in 1993.  The award-winning Bellevue design firm of 
  Jongejan/Gerard/McNeal was awarded the design contract in 1994.  The 
  Washington Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects
  bestowed an "Honor Award" on the firm for their design of the cemetery
  featuring a view of Mount Rainier.<p>
  A $7.9 million construction contract was awarded in September 1995 to 
  Aldrich & Associates of Bothell, Washington.  The first phase of 
  construction, approximately 43 acres, included:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>6,553 in-ground casketed gravesites;<br>
    <li>2,981 lawn crypts for cremated remains;<br>
    <li>1,620 garden niches for cremated remains; and,<br>
    <li>2,400 columbarium niches.<p>
  </ul>
  Sandra Noguez, former director of Nashville, Tenn., National Cemetery,
  was selected as Tahoma’s director in February 1996.<p>
