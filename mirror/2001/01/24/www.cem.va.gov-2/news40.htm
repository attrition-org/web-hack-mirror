<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br>
December 18, 2000<p><br>

<font size="4"><b>CONGRESS SUPPORTS VA NATIONAL CEMETERY GROWTH</b></font><p>
 </U><P>Washington, D.C. - The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to 
accelerate its planning, land acquisition, design and construction of several 
new national veterans cemeteries, based upon recent Congressional appropriations.</P>

 <P>“We are pleased to be given the resources to carry out, expeditiously, 
our mission to honor the service of our nation’s heroes – those who served in our 
armed forces,” said Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Hershel Gober.  
“More of our veterans will be able to find a final resting place in our national shrines.”  </P>

 <P>Congress recently approved: </P>

 <P>• $12 million to construct the future national cemetery at Fort Sill, Okla., 
serving the greater Oklahoma City area.  The land has been acquired and master 
planning completed.  Design has begun and may be completed by summer 2001, when a 
contract may be awarded for construction.  Construction could take two to three years.</P>

 <P>• $15 million to purchase land to build a cemetery in South Florida.  VA is 
considering two potential sites near Miami in Palm Beach County, where environmental 
assessments are underway.  </P>

 <P>• $2.5 million to complete master planning and design for a new cemetery near 
Atlanta.  The process to acquire a site offered for donation is underway.  When 
completed, master planning and design will go forward.</P>

 <P>• $1 million to complete master planning for a site near Pittsburgh.  
• $2 million for advanced planning purposes for three national cemeteries.  The 
funds will be used for master planning of cemeteries to be located near 
Sacramento, Calif., Detroit and Miami.</P>

  <P>VA’s goal is to have national cemeteries operational at all six of these locations
 within five years.  VA identified these locations among areas of greatest need for 
national cemeteries, based on concentrations of veteran population, in a report to 
Congress earlier this year as required by the Veterans Millennium Health Care and 
Benefits Act. </P>

  <P>Veteran deaths are expected to peak at 620,000 annually by 2008, up from 572,000 
estimated for 2000.  Even after the peak year, it will be nearly a decade before death 
rates fall below current levels.</P>

  <P>Gober noted that VA opened five national cemeteries since 1997, representing the 
largest expansion of the National Cemetery Administration since its beginnings in the 
Civil War.  He said VA’s goal is for 88 percent of veterans to live within 75 miles of 
a national cemetery or a VA-supported state veterans’ cemetery by 2006.  Currently, 
nearly 75 percent of veterans live within that distance.</P>
