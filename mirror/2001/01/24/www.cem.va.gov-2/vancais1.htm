<P ALIGN="CENTER">I. The National Cemetery Administration</P>
</B><P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;In 1862, President Lincoln signed into law legislation authorizing establishment of national cemeteries ". . . for the soldiers who shall die in the service of the country." Fourteen cemeteries were established in that year. These national cemeteries were the beginning of what has become the National Cemetery Administration.</P>
<P>&#9;After the Civil War, search and recovery teams visited hundreds of battlefields, churchyards, plantations and other locations where hasty wartime interments had been made. By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000 Civil War dead were reinterred in 73 national cemeteries.</P>
<P>&#9;The National Cemetery Administration has undergone many changes since its inception. In 1873, Congress extended the right of burial in a national cemetery to all honorably discharged Union veterans of the Civil War. By a 1933 Executive Order, certain national cemeteries were transferred from the War Department (now Department of the Army) to the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior. In</P>
<P>June 1973, Public Law 93-43 authorized the transfer of 82 other national cemeteries from the Department of the Army to the Veterans Administration, now the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This action combined the 82 Army cemeteries with 21 cemeteries already under VA's jurisdiction. With the addition</P>
<P>of 13 new cemeteries including the one opened in September 1997 in Tahoma, Washington, and the transfer of one historic site to the State of Kentucky, the National Cemetery Administration now comprises 115 national cemeteries. The Department of the Army still administers two national cemeteries, including Arlington National Cemetery, and the Department of the Interior administers 14, for a total of 131 national cemeteries.</P>
<P>&#9;In 1978, Congress established the State Cemetery Grants Program (Public Law 95-476). Administered by the National Cemetery Administration to aid States in the establishment, expansion and improvement of veterans cemeteries, the State Cemetery Grants Program complements the National Cemetery Administration by providing gravesites for veterans in those areas not adequately served by national cemeteries. State veterans cemeteries enhance VA's ability to meet the burial needs of America's veterans. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">II. General Information</P>
<P>1. INTERMENT IN NATIONAL AND STATE CEMETERIES</P><DIR>

</B><P>&#9;a. Burial in a national cemetery is based on military service. Requests for interment in national cemeteries should be directed to cemetery staff at the cemetery where burial is sought. <I>A list of cemeteries is provided in Section V of this information sheet. </I>The cemetery director determines eligibility for burial, usually at the time of need. Most categories of persons entitled to burial in VA national cemeteries are summarized in Section III of this information sheet.</P>
<P>&#9;b. Arlington National Cemetery is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. Inquiries concerning eligibility for interment there should be directed to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. <I>See Section V.4 of this information sheet for the address and phone number.</P>
</I><P>&#9;c. The two active national cemeteries administered by the Department of the Interior -- Andersonville National Cemetery in Georgia and Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in Tennessee -- use the same eligibility criteria as the National Cemetery Administration. <I>Addresses and telephone numbers for cemeteries administered by the Department of the Interior are provided in Section V.2 of this information sheet.</P>
</I><P>&#9;d. Eligibility criteria for burial in state veterans cemeteries are the same or similar to criteria for burial in VA national cemeteries, but some states have residency requirements and other more restrictive requirements. <I>State veterans cemeteries are listed in Section V.3 of this information sheet.</P></DIR>

</I><B><P>2. ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE</P><DIR>

</B><P>&#9;a. The National Cemetery Administration is authorized to bury eligible individuals in any VA national cemetery with available grave space. <I>See Section V.1 of this information sheet for a list of VA national cemeteries.</P>
</I><P>&#9;b. One gravesite is authorized for the interment of all eligible members of a family except where soil conditions require more than one grave, or when the number of family decedents requires more than one grave.</P>
<P>&#9;c. A gravesite is not reserved before it is needed for a burial. VA continues to honor reservations made prior to 1962, when cemeteries were under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army and reservations were allowed. When a death occurs and eligibility for interment in a national cemetery is determined, grave space is assigned by the cemetery director in the name of the veteran.</P>
<P>&#9;d. Most VA national cemeteries that have exhausted space for full-casket burials can still inter cremated remains. Occasionally, full-casket gravesites become available in these cemeteries due to disinterments or when gravesite reservations made prior to 1962 are canceled. Contact the cemetery director at the time of need for information regarding the availability of grave space.</P></DIR>

<B><P>3. ENTITLEMENT TO BURIAL BENEFITS</P><DIR>

</B><P>&#9;a. There is no charge for burial in a national cemetery. Cemetery employees will open and close the grave, and a headstone or marker with authorized inscription(s) will be provided by the Government for each unmarked grave. Flat bronze, granite or marble grave markers and upright marble or granite headstones are available to mark graves in the style consistent with existing monuments at the national cemetery.</P>
<P>&#9;b. At no expense to the next of kin, VA furnishes graveliners for new graves in national cemeteries with space available. For use in these cemeteries, the next of kin may purchase a private outer burial receptacle other than a graveliner and receive a monetary allowance equal to the average cost of a graveliner less administrative costs. This monetary allowance, in most cases, will partially defray the cost of purchasing an outer burial receptacle. VA may not furnish graveliners for graves in national cemeteries where there no longer is space for new casketed burials. However, if anyone wishes to provide an outer burial receptacle at their expense for the grave of a family member of an individual already buried in such a cemetery, they may do so. In this situation, the next of kin must consult the cemetery director in advance of installation.</P>
<P>&#9;c. A United States flag is usually provided by a funeral director to drape the casket or accompany the urn of a veteran who was discharged from military service under conditions other than dishonorable. Memorial flags can also be obtained at VA regional offices and most local post offices. After the committal service, the flag will be presented to the next of kin or close associate of the deceased. Flags may be donated to a national cemetery to be flown on appropriate days, if the cemetery has an Avenue of Flags program. VA also will issue a memorial flag on behalf of a servicemember who was missing in action and later presumed dead by the military department.</P>
<P>&#9;d. VA may not reimburse any costs associated with the burial, including transportation of the remains, of a decedent other than a veteran. VA will pay a monetary burial and funeral expense allowance for veterans who, at the time of death, were entitled to receive pension or compensation or would have been entitled to compensation but for receipt of military retirement pay. Eligibility for the allowance also may be established when death occurs in a VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary, or a hospital or nursing home with which VA contracted, and additional costs of transportation of the remains may be reimbursed in those cases. VA will also pay the cost of transporting the remains of a service-disabled veteran to the national cemetery with available grave space nearest his or her home. The person who bore the veteran's burial expenses may claim reimbursement up to prescribed limits.</P>
<P>&#9;e. A person who dies on active duty is entitled to certain benefits from the military. Information about these benefits is available from the branch of the Armed Forces in which the person served.</P>
<P>&#9;f. A Presidential Memorial Certificate may be obtained to honor the memory of any deceased veteran who was discharged under honorable conditions. The local VA Regional Office generally originates the first request for a Presidential Memorial Certificate. Requests also can be sent to the Office of Presidential Correspondence, Attention: Code VA-NCS, The White House, Washington, DC 20500. Eligible recipients include next of kin, other relatives and friends. Requests should be accompanied by a copy of a document such as a military discharge certificate to establish honorable service.</P>
<P>&#9;g. Additional information concerning reimbursement of burial expenses and other benefits by VA may be found in VA Pamphlet 80-97-1, "Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents." A copy of VA Pamphlet 80-97-1 can be obtained from most VA offices or the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. </P></DIR>

<B><P>4. ARRANGING AN INTERMENT IN A NATIONAL CEMETERY</P><DIR>

</B><P>&#9;a. Interment arrangements for an eligible veteran or dependent are made by the funeral director or the next of kin at the time of need by contacting the national cemetery in which burial is desired. A dependent is buried based upon the eligibility of the veteran. To establish the veteran's eligibility, the name of the veteran, together with the rank; serial, social security, and VA claim numbers, as applicable; date and place of entry into and separation from the service; branch of service; date and place of birth; and date of death should be furnished. If any of these items is not available, as many as possible should be furnished. A copy of the official military discharge document bearing an official seal or a DD 214 is usually sufficient to determine eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery. The document must show that release from service was under conditions other than dishonorable. For the majority of individuals, a DD 214 or other discharge document will be required to determine eligibility for burial; however, documentation such as a "20 year letter" covering release from reserve components or the National Guard may also qualify individuals for burial. If discharge information cannot be located, the VA Regional Office will also help to determine eligibility for burial. <I>More specific information on eligibility is in</I> <I>Section III of this information sheet</I>. (This information is solicited under chapter 24, title 38, United States Code, and is required to permit burial in a national cemetery. The information may be disclosed outside VA as permitted by law, or as stated in the <I>Federal Register</I> in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974. Failure to provide the required data may result in delay of burial until eligibility is verified.)</P>
<P>&#9;b. The cemetery staff will set a tentative date for the committal service pending verification of service and character of discharge, and will notify the applicant when the committal service is scheduled. Not until the director verifies eligibility and confirms the arrangements will the proposed date and time of the committal service be announced. The decedent may be transported to the cemetery only on the announced date of the committal service.</P>
<P>&#9;c. Cremated remains are interred in an in-ground gravesite, placed in a garden niche, or placed in a columbarium, where available. The container holding the cremated remains may not be brought to the national cemetery until the director verifies eligibility and confirms the arrangements.</P>
<P>&#9;d. To facilitate arranging an interment, a person contemplating burial in a national cemetery should assemble the information listed in paragraph a. above, prepare a statement of wishes, and place the information and statement among other important papers that will be immediately available to the person(s) making final arrangements for burial.</P>
<P>&#9;e. Many national cemeteries have set aside suitable areas to commemorate veterans whose remains were not recovered or identified, were buried at sea, or are otherwise unavailable for interment. VA will also provide a memorial headstone or marker to be placed in that section of the cemetery.</P></DIR>

<B><P>5. MILITARY HONORS</P>
</B><I><P>&#9; Military honors are not provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</I> Military honors, if desired, must be arranged in advance by the family or their representative. The cemetery staff can assist by providing the telephone numbers and addresses of nearby organizations that may be able to provide military honors, but the military commander or service organization officer determines if personnel are available. In the absence of military honors for a committal service, taps may be played on the cemetery carillon or by other electronic means, where available, if it is the wish of the family.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">III. Eligibility </P>
<P>1.</B> <B>PERSONS ELIGIBLE FOR BURIAL IN A NATIONAL CEMETERY</P>
</B><P>&#9;VA national cemetery directors have the primary responsibility for verifying eligibility for burial in VA national cemeteries. A determination of eligibility is usually made in response to a request for burial in a VA national cemetery. VA Regional Offices will also assist in determining eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery. The toll-free number for the nearest VA Regional Office is 1-800-827-1000.</P>
