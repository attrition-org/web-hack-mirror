  On July 9, 1999, Saratoga National Cemetery was dedicated as the 116th national cemetery 
  within the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration.<p>
  The new 373-acre cemetery will serve over 225,000 veterans and their families in upstate
  New York and western New England.<p>  
  In 1987, VA identified the Albany, N.Y., area as one of ten areas in the country most in
  need of burial space for veterans based on veteran populations.<p>
  VA identified the site, just north of the Saratoga National Historical Park, and prepared
  an Environmental Impact Statement in 1992.  Promptly thereafter, the Secretary of Veterans
  Affairs formally approved Saratoga as the site for the new national cemetery.<p>
  A contract to design the new cemetery was awarded to the LA Group of Saratoga in 1993.
  The master plan has since been completed.<p>
  A $11.6 million construction contract was awarded to Jersen Industries, Inc., of
  Waterford, N.Y., on October 10, 1997.<p>  
  When the 373-acre cemetery site is fully developed it will provide 175,500 burial spaces.
  Initial construction will develop approximately 60 acres, including:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>5,000 gravesites, 2,000 lawn crypts, 1,500 columbaria niches and 700 garden niches for cremated 
        remains;<br>
    <li>Entrance and public information center;<br>
    <li>Two committal shelters;<br>
    <li>Assembly area and memorial walkway;<br>
    <li>Administration/maintenance complex; and,<br>
    <li>Roadways, landscaping, utilities and irrigation.<p>
  </ul>
  Mary Ann Fisher was selected as Saratoga’s director in March 1998.<p>
