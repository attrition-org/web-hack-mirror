<ul>The <a href="611rpt.htm">Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act</a> of 1999 requires VA to establish six 
    additional national cemeteries in areas of the United States in which the need for burial 
    space is greatest.  Those areas are:  Atlanta, Georgia; Detroit, Michigan; Miami, Florida; 
    Sacramento, California; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.<p>



    <!-- In 1987, Public Law 99-576 directed the <a href="http://www.va.gov">
     U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</a> to identify geographic areas of
     the country most in need of burial space for veterans based on veteran 
     populations.<p>

     Northern California was identified in this report and San Joaquin Valley National 
     Cemetery in Gustine Calif., opened on June 5, 1992.  Tahoma, Wash., National Cemetery opened 
     on October 1, 1997, serving veterans in the Puget Sound area.  In 1999 and 2000, 
     four new national cemeteries on the reports opened.  They are: Saratoga, N.Y., National Cemetery 
     opened on July 14, 1999; Abraham Lincoln, Ill., National Cemetery opened on October 14, 1999; 
     Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, National Cemetery opened on May 12, 2000; and the Ohio Western Reserve 
     National Cemetery opened on June 19, 2000.  For current information on the status of new national 
     cemeteries refer to the Report to Congress on the Establishment of Additional National Cemeteries .<p>
