STOP&nbsp;HACKING&nbsp;WINDOZE&nbsp;- IT'S LAME !</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Research has shown that most hackers
practice hacking just for personal satisfaction and
excitement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Records of the hackers caught reveal that
these people do not even smoke or drink. They are not involved in any
other criminal activities except hacking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">According to some hackers, they feel nice
and they are able to attain an inner joy when they do hacking. This
strange phenomenon occurs because most hackers are lonely people who
have undergone lots of sorrow and psychological problems in the early
or childhood days of their lives. Later, these people try to release
their anger and get some enjoyment via hacking.</FONT></P>

<P>P.S. I'd like to meet you Hackweiser guys, but I fear you wouldn't
measure up to my expectations, if you know what I mean ?</P>
