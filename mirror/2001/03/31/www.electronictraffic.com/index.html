Do you like spam?<br>
Do you like your bandwidth wasted?<br>
Do you like your inbox filled with shit?<br>
Do you like the commercialisation of the internet?<br><br>

Neither do I. In fact, I <i>fucking hate spam</i>. So, as this company believes
in spamming to advertise their website, I decided to believe in cracking to remove
their internet presence. All's fair in love and war.<br><br>
