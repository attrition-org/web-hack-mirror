that are 'defaced' was defaced to put out a message. That is, that I am sick and tired of hearing people whine about their rights being 'stepped on' or 'violated', when these people complaining (ok, not all people do it) are people that have never really 
voted, never given a thought of attending a town hall meeting.. or in ANY WAY actually getting out and fighting for their rights... the ones we as spoiled americans take for granted in America each and every day. It's a sad world when corporations and cap
ital make judgements for us, and determine what we can and can not do. Take for instance the suit against 2600 by the MPAA (Motion picture association of America), they want to control how/when you can play your *yes, YOUR* DVDs ..and they are sueing 2600
 for posting links to a program that allows anyone to view their OWN DVDs (not pirated copies folks!) on their own computer any time, and in anyway they want. Its' absolutely ludicrous that we have allowed the 'elite few' to own our government, and corupt
 it before our very eyes. In closing, I just want to encourage the visitors of this site to get out and get active in their government.. before it's too late. </font><br><br>If you'd like more info on the DVD suits: www.opendvd.org. Also, www.2600.com. Th
ese two websites had NOTHING to do w/ the defacing of this page... DO NOT blame them. Hope this was informative and not intrusive.
<h1><a href="index2.php">Continue on to the original page.. sorry for the inconvienence</a></h1><br><br><br><h6>A note to the owner: I do not play your online game, nor do I hold anything against it.. but you did have substantial amounts of visitors, hope
fully, you will not take too big of an offense.</body></html>
