<center><u>to: gideon</u>
<p>I feel real lame redefacing this site (sorry war, i not defacin nothin
anymore just needed something as my last deface) but it is to get a
message
to gideon. I noticed in your deface you placed my nick in the "fuck you's"
list at the end... well sorry to see you feel that way. Calling me a bitch
will not get you anywhere either. u c, u dun even know what happened...
warlord gave me access to adventdata.com i found a lot more domains on
the server, i told warlord about them, he said that attrition/alldas would
not mirror them because it came from the same ip as his adventdata deface.
So i tryed one and did not take the credit i put r00t-access crew owns
u and put the whole groups nicks. I was even going to try to make it up
to warlord by giving him access to an isp when I found out he was going
to try to deface them. I know you probably are now just talking shit about
me, although I showed u a lot of stuff, i remember when u sent that icq
message and I helped u out with linux getting it up and running and which
flavor of linux to get and helped u out rooting boxes then u started
zerosignal
about a year ago. you probably wouldnt even be defacing if u didnt meet
me. oh well i guess some people are just ungrateful motherfuckers in the
end. no offense.
