No fancy html here. I just wanted to use this spot to get a few points across.
<br> 
I want to be the first one to point out that I dont think defacing is hacking nor do I claim it to be difficult. I only associate it with the equivelant of graffiti. Its fun.

Im tired of hearing about which exploits are gay - and whos a script kiddie. Everyone on these mirrors is a fuckin script kid and none of us are cool. Were just being punks and having a good time.

Sorry for the lack of html or funny pictures - Im just aggrivated by some kid on IRC. Hackweiser loves you. pr0phet loves you.
