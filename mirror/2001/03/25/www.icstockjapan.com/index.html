<p><font size=-1><b><font color="#FFFF00">hackweiser</font></b><font color="#FF0000">:

you guys own, you never let me down and your close friends. I'm with you

till the end.</font></font>

<br><font size=-1><b><font color="#FFFF00">fejed/negrox</font></b><font color="#FF0000">:

the only two cool guys i know from LoU, you guys aren't media whores (wow

such a find)</font></font>

<br><font size=-1><b><font color="#FFFF00">convienent store</font></b><font color="#FF0000">:

for providing me with a endless supply of jolt (TM)</font></font>

<br><font size=-1><b><font color="#FFFF00">for those who believe in us</font></b><font color="#FF0000">:

even though we act like assholes all the time, we really appreciate the

support you give us</font></font>

<br><font size=-1><b><font color="#FFFF00">and to those coders, auditors,

whitehats and anyone else who don't have a sense of elitism in them, when

the rest of their friends/peer's do</font></b><font color="#FF0000">:</font></font>

<br><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>even though its not much coming

from us, you have our full appreciation. When in a position where its not

"cool" to like a defacing group, or even think they are funny, if you keep

on doing it anyways. That's respectable. Even though I have met only a

few of you, the few I have met have surprised me in intelligence and acceptance

alike. You all deserve a medal for open thinking, and hopefully the rest

of the security underground will one day follow in your suit. Now last

time i named someone (with these qualities), I got in trouble because he

doesn't appreciate being related on a illegal matter. But all I can say

is, he's being framed&nbsp; at the moment for something he did not commit.

These are the people who I respect in the security and underground world

alike, and these are the people who will possibly advance human thinking.

I hate ignorance. Thank you for your time. (hi initd_ =D)</font></font>
