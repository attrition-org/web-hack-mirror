<LI>How does <B>BLESS USA</B> differ from other Coptic relief organizations in America?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8><B>BLESS USA</B> is the official nonprofit charity organization of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States.

<LI>Is <B>BLESS USA</B> staffed by volunteers, or paid staff?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Through God’s grace, <B>BLESS USA</B> has been functioning with the assistance of a voluntary, part-time staff.  There are no paid employees or staff members of <B>BLESS USA</B>.</UL><P>

<LI>Does <B>BLESS USA</B> have office hours?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Yes, currently the office hours are Tuesday-Thursday from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM EST.  Messages are retrieved daily and calls are usually returned within 24 hours.</UL><P>

<LI>Who supervises <B>BLESS USA</B> in America?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>At the Archdiocese of North America, where <B>BLESS USA</B> is located, His Grace Bishop David supervises and monitors <B>BLESS USA’s</B> activities.</UL><P>

<LI>Are previous members of BLESS CA, BLESS International and BLESS NJ now members of <B>BLESS USA</B>?<P>

<LI>Is there a minimum amount of money required to participate in a <B>BLESS USA</B> project?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>No.  <B>BLESS USA</B> welcomes any contribution for any amount.  There is no minimum.</UL><P>

<LI>Can one send contributions to a certain church or monastery?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8><B>BLESS USA</B> diligently attempts to deliver contributions to our beloved churches and monasteries in Egypt.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>If for any reason we cannot deliver it, the contributor is contacted for instructions on how to proceed. In most cases, however, we are successful in finding a way to send these contributions.</UL><P>

<LI>Why is there an education fund if education in Egypt is free?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Even though education is free, students still need to pay fees and buy supplies.  Also the need for private tutoring has greatly increased in the Egyptian education system.</UL><P>

<LI>Can one send money to a relative in need or someone they know through <B>BLESS USA</B>?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Contributors can only send to individuals who are registered with the Charity Department of the Bishopric of Public, Ecumenical & Social Services (BLESS).  These individuals must first be assessed by the Charity Department as needing support.</UL><P>

<LI>Have you tried to obtain funds from the US Government or from any other outside sources?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8><B>BLESS USA</B> is currently researching options that will enable us to obtain funds from outside sources.  If you have any suggestions, please contact <B>BLESS USA</B>.</UL><P>
</OL>

<P><a name="Sponsor"><B>Sponsor A Family Project</B></a>

<OL start="6">
<LI>Is the Sponsor-a-Family project a one-time contribution, or will I have to contribute every month?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>The sponsor-a-family project can occur one time if the contributor so wishes; however, most people contribute monthly.  There are also some individuals who choose to contribute semi-annually and annually.  It is flexible and dependent on the contributor.</UL><P>

<LI>Is there a specific or minimum amount to sponsor a family?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>No, one can contribute any amount.  Each family has different circumstances and needs. If a family's needs are not met by a sponsor's contribution, the remainder of that family's support comes from the <B>BLESS USA</B> General Fund.</UL><P>

<LI>Can a contributor obtain the names and addresses of the people they sponsor?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>We do not have any biographical information about the individuals sponsored, rather a description of each family's situation.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Since we have promised confidentiality to those whom we serve, we need to preserve their dignity and privacy.  We also need to be sensitive to their feelings and self-dignity.</UL><P>

<LI>Can the contributor choose from the sponsor-a-family list the type of family condition or situation he/she wants to sponsor?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>The assignment of families to contributors is random because all of the families are in desperate need. <B>BLESS</B> tries to provide for all the different types of cases and to meet their needs accordingly.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Random assignment eliminates preferential distribution and exclusion of particular persons or groups.</UL><P>

<LI>If families on the sponsor list are not sponsored by contributors, do they receive money anyway?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Yes.  Even if a specific family is not sponsored by contributors, they still receive funds from the General Fund of <B>BLESS USA</B>.</UL><P>

<LI>Can a contributor sponsor a certain family they know in Egypt?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Contributors can only send to individuals who are registered with the Charity Department of the Bishopric of Public, Ecumenical & Social Services (<B>BLESS</B>).  One can sponsor a certain family only if they have been assessed by the Charity Department as needing support.</UL><P>

<LI>Can we send clothing or equipment rather than money?<P>

<LI>What percentage of funds raised actually go to Egypt, and what is the percentage of administrative costs?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Administrative costs fluctuate between 7-10%.   Thus 90-93% of the contributions go directly to Copts in Egypt who are in need.</UL></P>

<LI>What is the matching gift program?<P>

<LI> Can one give their contribution during the church presentations conducted by <B>BLESS USA</B>?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Church presentations are reserved for informing people about the <B>BLESS USA</B> service.  The intention is not to collect contributions or raise funds.  Thus it is preferable that one sends their contribution directly to <B>BLESS USA</B>.</UL><P>

<OL start="11">
<LI>Who handles and supervises the distribution of funds?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Under the leadership of His Holiness Pope Shenouda III, along with His Grace Bishop Youannes, funds are distributed to Copts who are disadvantaged and in need.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>His Holiness Pope Shenouda III personally meets many of the people who are in need every Thursday in Cairo, and every other Saturday in Alexandria.</UL><P>

<LI>Is there a report published about where and how the funds were distributed?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Annually BLESS in Egypt issues a comprehensive report on how and where funds were used.</UL><P>

<LI>How and when is the money sent to Egypt?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>The money is wired to the BLESS account in Egypt every month.  The bank to which funds are wired is secure.</UL><P>

<LI>Do any of the funds sent go to the building of churches in Egypt or any other project(s)?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>No.  All of the funds <B>BLESS USA</B> sends to Egypt are used exclusively for distribution to the people who are in need.</UL><P>

<LI>Does <B>BLESS USA</B> help those in need in Cairo only?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>No.  <B>BLESS USA</B> funds are not directed only to individuals in Cairo, but are extended and distributed to people in need in different parts of Egypt.  For example, funds have been previously sent to the dioceses of Deir-Moass, Koussia, Manfaalout, Abanoub, Abou-Teeg and Deirut.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>However because of current limited funds, we are unable to reach out to all the impoverished areas of Egypt.</UL><P>

<LI>How does a person in Egypt become eligible for assistance from BLESS?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>A person who is in need first seeks aid from the priest in his/her church.  If the priest is unable to provide for them, then that person, along with the priest, will seek help from the bishop of their diocese.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>In the event the diocese is unable to provide for that person, the bishopric will supply him/her with a letter stating their condition and needs, which they in turn take to BLESS for assessment and processing.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>For people who do not live in areas where there are dioceses, they first seek help from their priest.  If the priest is unable to provide for their needs, he issues them a letter, which they then take to BLESS for evaluation and processing.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>This cooperative effort between BLESS, the dioceses and the churches ensures that the burden is not placed on one entity so that as many people as possible are helped.</UL><P>

<LI>Are funds in Egypt evenly distributed, or are they distributed only to certain individuals?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Funds are distributed to individuals based on their need; a family of four may need less funds than a family of six.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>The BLESS team in Egypt, led by H.G. Bishop Youannes, keeps comprehensive track of individuals who receive funds from BLESS USA.   BLESS extensively investigates and verifies every case it receives for aid.  A careful and thorough evaluation method is used to identify individuals in need and assess their situation:<P>
<OL type="a">
<LI>Assessment - H.G. Bishop Youannes, along with the BLESS team, meets with individuals who will receive funds from <B>BLESS USA</B> to determine legitimacy and need.
<LI>Distribution - funds are then distributed based on need.
<LI>Follow-up - individuals who received funds are monitored in order to ensure that funds given are used for the purpose intended.
<LI>Reassessment and update - His Grace Bishop Youannes and the BLESS team in Egypt work diligently to ascertain whether the situations of individuals receiving funds from <B>BLESS USA</B> are deteriorating or improving. Records are then updated.
<LI>Redistribution - depending on the findings of the reassessment and update of a situation, funds are then redistributed accordingly.
</OL></UL><P>

<LI>Do funds go to Copts who are victims of militants, and how are these Copts helped by BLESS in general?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>Yes, <B>BLESS USA</B> has a special fund for such situations.  Some of the families who receive contributions from <B>BLESS USA</B> are victims of fanatical attacks, or terrorism.  These individuals are assisted with contributions of money, clothing, economic opportunity assistance, medical assistance, educational assistance, etc. to help them recuperate.</UL><P>

<LI>Does <B>BLESS USA</B> benefit our non-Christian brothers & sisters as well?<P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>As there are many organizations that help our non-Christian brothers and sisters, <B>BLESS USA</B> focuses on alleviating the suffering of Copts in Egypt.  We are unable to directly aid them because of the limited funds and resources.</UL><P>
<UL><IMG border=0 height=8 src="../images/bullet.gif" width=8>The Development Department of BLESS in Egypt turns very poor villages into stable, productive and self-sufficient communities.
