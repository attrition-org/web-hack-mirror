<br><b>The
Beginning</b><br><br>
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
<b>mIRC
war
group</b>
called
<b>tribe</b>.
Their
only
amusements
were
attacking
people
and
systems
on
internet,
and
taking
over
IRC
channels
on
<b>IRCNet</b>-
when
ever
they
weren't
busy
wanking.<br><br>
They
couldn't
accomplish
anything
alone
so
they
<b>allied</b>
with
another
bunch
of
idiots-
the
<b>Warlords</b>
lead
by
"mighty"
<b>Ace24</b>.<br>
<br><br><b>"Attack
Everything
You
See"</b><br>
<br>Together
they
sought
channels
to
take
over
and
ruin.
Soon
they
found
a
program
called
<b>smurf</b>
on
a
WWW
site.
They
learnt
how
to
<b>0wn</b>
Linux
boxes
with
<a href="http://www.rootshell.com">www.rootshell.com</a>
scripts.
They
learnt
how
to
install
<b>root
kits</b>
and
<b>DoS</b>
(Denial
of
Service)
<b>t00lz</b>.
With
their
new
t00lz
they
could
more
effectively
jam
internet
connections
and
IRCNet
servers.
Since
this
was
the
only
"skill"
they
had,
they
abused
lots
and
attacked
thousands
and
thousands
of
users
and
servers.
<br>
<br><br><b>The
Hard
Life
of
Clueless
Packet
Kids</b><br>
<br>Because
they
were
not
particularly
smart,
they
weren't
too
successful
either.
Instead
they
got
continuously
<b>0wned</b>
by
their
victims.
They
were
kicked
off
and
banned
from
the
channels
they
tried
to
attack.<br>
<br>They
tried
to
solve
it
by
<a href="http://www.thebigboss.com/opt/">packeting</a>
more
and
more.
They
even
found
teenage
power-hungry
<b>IRC
operators</b>
stupid
enough
to
join
their
crew.
Even
with
their
help,
<b>tbe/wrl</b>
kept
fuxing
up
their
abuse
business.<br>
<br><br><b>Today:
The
Blissful,
Long
Awaited
End</b><br>
<br>Years
later
they
realized
that
they
are
losers
and
gave
up.
They
finally
/quit
their
<b>mIRC</b>s.
They
finally
left
<b>IRCNet</b>
and
its
peaceful
channel
owners
alone.<br><br>
The
next
day
they
started
their
own
IRC
network
that
no
one
goes
to
and
no
one
gives
a
shit
about.
But
they
didn't
stop
wanking.
They
didn't
stop
trying
to
insult
people
and
being
assholes
in
general.
This
is
how
<b>www.exploited.org.uk</b>
was
born.<br>
<br>That
is
<b>tribe</b>
today:
leeching
porn
pics
and
running
their
little
IRC
network-
and
still
getting
0wned.
Decision
to
leave
IRCNet
was
undeniably
good.
If
only
they
had
done
it
five
years
earlier
before
doing
harm
to
thousands
and
thousands
of
internet
users
with
their
clueless
packeter
colleagues:
<b>MnM</b>,
<b>X-org</b>,
<b>t0rn</b>,
<b>Danny-Boy</b>...
the
list
is
endless.

annoying
we

used
in
the

Other

because
psychoid
is
such
a
nice

we
decided
to
leave
them
alone.
We
especially
liked
his

<b>stacheldraht

demonstrates

weaknesses.

no

we

read

the

I've
been
playing
a
small
part
in
somewhat
of
an
Internet
drama
the
past
couple
of
days,Its
small
potatoes
when
you
consider
the
grand
scheme
of
things,
but
that
doesn't
stop
it
from
being
fun.
What
fascinates
me
is
how
much
some
perceived
slight
on
a
message
board
or
a
website
can
anger
people.<br>
<br>
I've
never
been
able
to
take
anything
that
happens
online
seriously.<br>
<br>
I've
never
had
an
&quot;on-line
relationship&quot;
I've
never
met
anyone
in
the
real
world
that
I've
only
known
previously
online.
Maybe
this
is
why
I
never
feel
anything
but
amusement
for
what
happens
on
&quot;the
net&quot;.</p>
<p>If
you
find
yourself
genuinely
upset
by
someone
disrespecting
you
on
a
site
or
message
board
to
the
point
where
you
do
something
stupid/illegal
or
threaten
someone
with
violence
or
some
other
&quot;real
world&quot;
consequences
you
need
to
get
a
fucking
grip
and
take
a
fucking
break.</p>
