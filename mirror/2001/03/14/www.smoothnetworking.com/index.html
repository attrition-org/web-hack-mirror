piece
piece of shit you call a computer?
<P>Anyways, you are not secure, find out your security problems and fix

instead of looking like a lamer jon. And as for ColdFuzion, your just

And I'm not just one of those little kiddies who follow the crowd and pretend not to like Micro$hit for no reason, I have my opinions, and other people have theirs.
<P>While I'm on the topic of Microsoft, however, I feel that everybody
