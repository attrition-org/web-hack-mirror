Okay, defacing is hitting an all time gay++ high.

I was just looking through alldas.de and you know - when windows started kind of taking off as the number 1 defaced OS I thought that was good - because I dislike Microsoft. But now.. damn people give it a rest. I saw this group pow do SIX windows REDEFACEMENTS. And THEN have the nerve to say HACKED BY POW - etc. Its not a hack you morons. You use your fucking web browser to move a couple files and echo a few lines. This isnt just directed at POW - because theres alot of people doing it. If you are going to be gay and only do windows defacements like everyone else - at LEAST get your own domains to do - and admit that it isnt a HACK - its a stupid browser attack. I have to eat breakfast. bye.
