<p><font face="Arial Black"><h1>It seems that you guys think that defacing
high profile subdomains of sites with unicode.pl and netcat.exe means that
you are a good defacer/hacker. You are not hackers at all, not a fuckin'
one of you can code a lick of any language. You guys sit around and think
you are cool because you have had media through a defacement that the-rev
stole from someone in hackweiser after they dropped it in an irc channel
and the-rev has admitted to it in private conversations. Now for Downkaos,
Ross youre not smart whatsoever and you thought net bios authentication
occurs on port 139 and you even swore that the two most common functions
in the stack were push and pull.  We have schooled you before and we can
do it again and again. Using other peoples exploits to deface sites is not
hacking, you cannot get a job in the security industry with the
cridentials of using other peoples scripts to deface a site. You guys
truely are idiots.</h1></font>
