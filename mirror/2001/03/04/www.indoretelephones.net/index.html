        something? I mean COME ON!</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Bah! anyways, the bottom line? Indore Telephones got their 
        ass whooped... and this is an organization which serves some &quot;1,66,000&quot; 
        Telephone Subscribers and some &quot;6000&quot; (Yes, we know... pathetic) 
        Internet Subscribers... btw, guys.. &quot;Tring, Tring&quot;? PUHLEAZE! 
        You guys seriously need to hire a GOOD webmaster 'cause... DAMN... heh, 
        what the hell.. here's the Index page for all to enjoy -&gt; <a href="sucks.html">Indore 
        Telephones</a><br>
        <br>
        By the way, the Indian &quot;cease-fire&quot; in Kashmir is a scam, dreamt 
        up, most probably, by the pathetic Jassi. It's nothing more than a shamefully 
        hopless attempt to salvage what's left of India's image. Well, guess what... 
        the killing has NOT stopped and every day unarmed civilians are gunned 
        down, women are raped.. children murdered in front of their mothers.. 
        all this to deny the Kashmiri people their God-given right... the right 
        to choose... the right to live freely. These people were SOLD to the Indian 
        government by the Dogra ruler at the time of the partition of the sub-continent. 
        SOLD like cattle... SOLD against their wishes to people who had absolutely 
        no respect/understanding for their religion... their heritage... their 
        rights. Not much unlike the slaves in America we suppose.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Be warned! the time has come... not only will these people 
        rise to claim what is rightfully theirs... FREEDOM from tyranny... but 
        will whoop India's ass in the process. How? Well... answer us this... 
        a handful of un-paid/under-equipped/un-trained Freedom Fighters holding 
        off some 500,000-600,000 paid/trained/well-equiped Indian Troops... how?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We'd love to stay and diss you some more but... you guessed 
        it, the pizza dude is finally here! Oh and, we think we've already done 
        a fine job of rubbing this security-BREACH-that-resulted-in-the-DEFACEMENT-of-an-Indian-GOVERMENT-site 
        in your faces. :-)<br>

        If THIS is what you call SECURITY, we can be sure... <font color="#FFFFFF">Ka</font><font color="#003300">shmir 
        </font>will soon be liberated from the evil clutches of the Hindu.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We almost forgot.. Jaswanth Singh... check your bunghole 
        dude, we think the erectile-projectiles were too much for you to handle 
        alone, bring Bal Thakray to the party next time h0<font face="Century Gothic">e!</font></font></p>
