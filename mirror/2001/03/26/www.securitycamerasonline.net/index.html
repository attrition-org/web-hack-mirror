<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times New Roman">Hi, I'm Bob. Personally I
don't like the term "burglar", I prefer to think of myself as a
security verifier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times New Roman">I break into homes to point
out the weakness in their doors and windows.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times New Roman">Once I get in, I don't
steal anything or trash the place, no sir!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times New Roman">First I tidy up any mess I
made, then I leave the home owners a note saying how sorry I was to
burglarize their house, and that I didn't look at any of their
personal stuff. Then I give them my phone number in case they want to
know how to protect their home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times New Roman">Then on my way out I put a
new lock on the door that I got in through.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times New Roman">You know I'm doing the
community a good service, but I still get the occasional ungrateful
customer. Oh well, that's life !</FONT></P>
