Phreaking as a revolt against the wrath of the evil telecom empires.  What does this all boil down to? Exploring the phone systems?  No, its seems like IRC, USEnet, WebBoards, and the like have had a constant flood of youngsters
only interested with making a free phone call. Nothing more, nothing less.
 Venturing out into the uncharted tunnels of the telco? Its practically never heard or spoken of anymore.  A mere whisper, a faint echo of the past.
"Asynchronous signalling? Whats that? I know how to use a redbox if thats what you mean", fucking idiots! What makes things worse is that the ones whom type up almost decent, inteligent "explanations" are just regurgitating text that they seemed to have quickly skimmed through, without any comprehension of what just flickered past their eyes.  Is this what its all come to? Groups like the "Phreakers Guild" whom do write ups with stolen information off of gfiles written in the mid '80s? Save the Phreaker Scene while there's still a microscopic untainted portion left.</font></td></tr><tr><td><br><hr>
