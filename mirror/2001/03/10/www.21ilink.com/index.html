<b><font size="6">Dear World, <p><font face="Arial Black"><h1>Howdy..we
have realized the current conditions of the war torn situations across the
globe and hackweiser has deliberated long and hard on the situation and
our representatives have prepared the following statement</h1></font>
<center>Fuck you guys, burn in hell you stinky hippies!
 <p><font face="Arial Black"><h1> Evidentally we spent the entire night
getting prepared and deliberating and planning our message to be as
politically correct as we could get it...or we might've got drunk and
humped your moms. You be the judge :). Ta Ta For Now.

to know in my heart that everyone know has a price for which their
thoughts and morals can be compromised for material possesions. You trade
your souls for dollar bills and walk around like mindless zombies
oblivious to your state of being. You have traded individuality for
glamour. I am sick and tired of seeing every fucking person walking around
looking like an MTV reject. I cannot stand fake people and that is what
99% of the world is comprised of. Take a stand and make yourself stand out
in a crowd dont sellout to the corporate media demon. --> </body> </html>
