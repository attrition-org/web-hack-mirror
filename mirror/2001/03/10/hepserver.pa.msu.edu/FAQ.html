<b><p>Q:  I do not have a PC to add to the Domain at this time but would
like to try out the system on one of the PCs that are added to the
Domain, if possible.<br>

<p>A: A PC on the Physics/Astronomy network does NOT have to be a member of the 
Domain in order to access the server, you will be prompted for your username and 
password however if you try to access from outside the Domain.<br>

<p>Q: Your account request form does not ask the node/machine name of the local
machine and its ip address.  Don't you need that information?<br>

<p>A: No, the IP address of your local machine is not needed but you will need to
have the network connection configured properly for optimal use of the server.
These settings will be checked when I come and help you connect for the first
time.<br>

<p>Q: Part of the reason for asking the above question:
I work from two NT machines one at the office and one at home.
Presummably setting up the office machine is no problem.  What about the home
machine?  It is connected to the internet via a cable ethernet connection; and
it has a MSU ip address.  Right now, it does not belong to any domain.  How
can I set it up to join the HepServer domain?<br>

<p>A: Connecting to the server from a home machine is a little
more complicated. In order to access the server from a remote (off campus)
machine I believe that you must be part of the PHYSICS-HEP workgroup. To do that
double click on the Network icon in the control panel then add PHYSICS-HEP
to the workgroup field. You may have to click the &quot;change&quot; button to do this.
Then click OK. You will be prompted to restart your machine. Once you have
rebooted and the network connection is established you should be able to
access resources on the server. Double click on the Network Neighborhood icon,
then the HEPSERVER icon. Depending on how your machine is configured you may be
prompted for your server username and password. From what I understand it
is not possible to log on directly to the server from home but you can use
shared resources. That means that you can not change your password but can
still read and write to server disks from home.

 If all else fails you can map a server drive by right clicking on the Network
Neighborhood, select &quot;Map Network Drive&quot; type: \\HEPSERVER\Users in the Path
field.<br>

<p>Q:How do I <a NAME="set permissions">set permissions on a folder?<br>

<p>A:Here is a brief explanation of the process, if you need further assistance
send Email to <a href="mailto:nila@msupa.msu.edu">Mike Nila</a> or phone 5-3523.
Right click on the folder of file that you wish to change permissions
on. Select &quot;Properties&quot; from the menu. Click on the &quot;Security&quot; tab, then the
&quot;Permissions&quot; button. You are presented with a dialog box that shows the current
permission settings. Change the settings by using the &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot; buttons.
Use the &quot;Help&quot; button for more information. You should always give yourself
&quot;Full Control.&quot; Be very careful when giving the &quot;Everyone&quot; group permissions. 
EVERYONE means EVERYONE in the whole world! There are not many times that this 
group should be given more than &quot;Read&quot; permission. Assigning &quot;Read&quot; actually gives 
read and execute permissions.
