<H3>Who can use the HEPSERVER?</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">All HEP Staff and Faculty members are welcome
to use shared resources on the server. There are certain requirements
that the computer you are connecting with must meet. PC's must
be running Windows 9x or NT and have a working network connection.
You also need to be part of the PHYSICS-HEP Domain. To see what
Domain you currently belong to, or to change domains use the Network
utility in your control panel. Computers running DOS (anybody
really doing this?) or Windows 3.x can also connect, but additional
software may have to be added to the system. Mac's must be running
system 7.1 or higher.</FONT></P>

<P>Mac usage is limited to file sharing at this time, however,
I hope to include other resources soon. For more infomation on
Mac's follow these links: <A HREF="http://hepserver.pa.msu.edu/Mac_connect.html">Connecting
a Mac</A> or <A HREF="mac_usage.html">Mac
Usage</A></P>
