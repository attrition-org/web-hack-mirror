<p>This page contains information for using the <b>Mac Users</b> directory
on the HEP server. If you need help connecting your Mac follow this link

<h2><center>Mac Files on the HEP Server</center></h1>

<p>Once you have connected your Mac to the server an icon that looks like
this will appear on your desktop. <img SRC="mac_icon.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"> Any documents
placed in this folder have public access. That means any domain (server)
user can modify these files. If a Mac users would like tighter security on
files they can create a folder inside the Mac Users area. When you create a 
folder you can set access privileges for it. By setting privileges, you can 
determine who can see and change the folder and the files in it. You do this 
by selecting the folder and choosing Sharing from the Finder's File menu on 
your Macintosh. The access privileges you set on folders in Macintosh-accessible 
volumes (the Mac Users folder) are translated to Windows NT-style permissions on 
the Server.</p>

<p>A personal "private" directory is also created for Mac users. To access this directory
connect to the server as a regisered user with the username and password provided and
select your user directory.



<p>If you're sharing files with MS-DOS users, it's a good idea to name files and folders using the 8.3 standard (eight characters, followed by a period and a three-character extension) used by MS-DOS-based computers--for example, CHAPTER1.DOC. That way, MS-DOS users of shared files can easily find the file on the Server.</p>
