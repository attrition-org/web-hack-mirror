<h5><a name="g1">FINE ARTS </a></h5>

<ul>
    <li>The Czech Republic ranks among the most attractive
        tourist destinations in all of Europe thanks to numerous
        artictic monuments which display a rich variety of
        artistic styles combined with high preservation
        standards. </li>
    <li>After the fall of the Great Moravian Empire (905), which
        was artistically influenced by Byzantium, Czech art
        developed within the scope of West European artistic
        styles, though these styles were often adapted in unique
        ways. </li>
    <li>Czech Gothic painting in particular developed its own
        distincive style (<i>anonymous Master of the Vyssi Brod
        Altar, Master Theodoricus etc.</i>). </li>
    <li>Also outstanding is the work of architect Petr Parler,
        especially the Gothic <a
        href="http://sunsite.ms.mff.cuni.cz/prague/sightseeing/chram_sv_vita.html">St.
        Vitus Cathedral </a>at Prague Castle and the decoration
        of the Old Town Bridge Tower of the famous Charles
        Bridge. </li>
    <li>The late Gothic Vladislav Hall at Prague Castle, a work
        by <i>Benedikt Reid</i>, is one of the most marvellous
        secular halls of late Gothic style in the world. </li>
    <li>During the Renaissance and the Manneristic Period
        numerous foreigners, mainly Italians, worked in Bohemia.
        The Emperor <a href="http://sco1.hrad.cz/sph/R_II.html">Rudolf
        II </a>(who reigned between 1576 and 1611), an ardent
        collector and patron of the arts, brought many
        outstanding works by European artists to Bohemia which
        today form the basis of various contemporary collections.
    </li>
    <li>The appearance of the Czech landscape was considerably
        enriched by Baroque architecture (especially by the
        buildings of <i>Christopher and Kilian Ignaz Diezenhoffer
        and Giovanni Santini</i>) </li>
    <li>In addition, Czech Baroque painting (<i>Petr Brandl, Jan
        Kupecky </i>etc.) as well as sculpture (<i>Ferdinand
        Maximilian Brokoff, Matthias Bernhard Braun</i>) reached
        a high standard. </li>
    <li>At the beginning of 20th century Czech Art Nouveau was
        among the world's finest (mainly in architecture and
        applied arts); the painter<a
        href="http://www.mucha.cz/mucha/default.asp"><i>Alfons
        Mucha </i></a>in particular made the style famous abroad.
    </li>
    <li>Cubistic architecture is completely unique in Prague and
        functionalist buildings are also of great artistic value.
        A number of remarkable Czech artists of the 20th century
        lived and worked at least partly abroad, for example the
        painters <i>Frantisek Kupka, Emil Filla, Toyen and Josef
        Sima</i>. </li>
    <li>Even contemporary Czech art, in spite of the difficulties
        in the communist era, retains a high standard (<i>Jan
        Zrzavy, Mikulas Medek, Jiri Tichy, Jiri Kolar</i>). </li>
    <li>The birth of photography as an original art form is
        connected with names such as <i>Frantisek Drtikol,
        Jaromir Funke, Jaroslav Rossler and Josef Sudek</i>. </li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="g2">MUSIC </a></h5>

<p>The Czech music scene came alive in the 19th century as
national awareness began to increase, fostering composers the two
great composers <i>Antonin Dvorak </i>and <i>Bedrich Smetana </i>whose
work is played all over the world to this day. In the early part
of this century the Czech composer <i>Leos Janacek </i>wrote
strikingly original music that has achieved increasing popularity
around the world in recent years. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The roots of Czech musical history are lodged in the
        distant 9th century. Over the course of the 11th century
        Gregorian chants predominated. They were complimented by
        traditional Czech sacred songs such as Saint Wenceslas. </li>
    <li>Between 1583 and 1612 during the reign of <a
        href="http://sco1.hrad.cz/sph/R_II.html">Rudolf II</a>,
        the Habsburg Imperial Orchestra - among the biggest
        ensembles in Europe - had its seat at Prague Castle. The
        Czech composer <i>J.D. Zelenka</i>, a contemporary of
        Bach's, was hailed as one of the leading composers of his
        age. </li>
    <li>The arrival of the musical classicism period at the end
        of the 18th century saw the establishment of several new
        municipal opera houses in the country including the famed
        F.A. Nostitz theatre (later renamed the Stavovske
        theatre). It was here that some of Mozart's most famous
        operas had their opening nights. </li>
    <li>A distinctive trait of the period was the emigration of
        Czech musicians fleeing low standards of living and
        religious oppression in their homeland. Czech musicians
        remained popular abroad though (<i>J. V. Stamitz </i>worked
        at Mannheim, the <i>Benda </i>family in Berlin and Gotha,
        <i>J. Myslivecek </i>in Italy, <i>A. Rejcha </i>in
        Paris). </li>
    <li>The establishment of a new period of Czech music is
        connected with <i>B. Smetana </i>(1824-1884), <i>A.
        Dvorak </i>(1841-1904) and <i>Z. Fibich </i>(1850-1900).
        In the period 1890-1930 the leading personalities were <i>L.
        Janacek, J. B. Foerster, O. Ostrcil, V. Novak and J. Suk</i>,
        and later <i>J. B. Martinu</i>. </li>
    <li>In the second half of the 20th century <i>M. Kabelar </i>and
        <i>P. Eben </i>achieved a worldwide reputation. </li>
    <li>The foundation of the Czech Philharmonic was of decisive
        importance for musical life. They performed for the first
        time in 1896 (among the conductors were <i>V. Talich, R.
        Kubelik, K. Ancerl, and V. Neumann</i>). </li>
    <li>Czech concert art was made famous above all by several
        internationally acclaimed violinists, pianists, chamber
        ensembles and singers. Among them are the violinist <i>F.Ondricek</i>,
        singers <i>F. Burian </i>and <i>J. Novotna</i>, and the
        pianist <i>R. Firkusny </i>chamber. In addition to the
        Czech Philharmonic, the Symphonic Orchestra of the City
        of Prague FOK is also well known. </li>
    <li>The highlight of Czech concert life is the annual musical
        festival <i>Prague Spring</i>, featuring performers from
        around the world. </li>
    <li>Despite political repression, jazz and rock‚n roll
        music started to develop at the end of the 1950s, mainly
        in clubs and alternative theatres. These were hot-beds of
        creativity from which many world-famous names arose, such
        as <i>J. Stivin and R. Dasek</i>. Many of them, such as <i>J.
        Mraz, J. Hammer and A. Vitous </i>established themselves
        as international stars living abroad. </li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="g3">LITERATURE </a></h5>

<p>After centuries of development, Czech literature began to
attract international attention over the course of this century.
Recently, the names of several Czech writers have joined the
ranks of the world's literary luminaries and their work has been
translated into dozens of languages. </p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most famous of Prague's literati was the
German-Jewish writer <i>Franz Kafka</i>. In a series of unique
novels and short stories Kafka mapped out the state of modern
society. The dilemmas his characters found themselves in came to
symbolize the absurdities of modern life, which people now
describe as Kafkaesque. </p>

<p>Kafka's works are echoed in the internationally renowned
novels of <i>Milan Kundera </i>which delve into the problematics
of personal identity in today's world. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Many great writers emerged out of the period between the
        two world wars. Among them, perhaps the most famous was <i>Karel
        Capek </i>a humanist who wrote a number of anti-military
        works. In one of them he invented the word ‚Robot'
        which became an international word (R.U.R.- Rossum's
        Universal Robots). He also founded the crucial Czech
        literary organization PEN Club. </li>
    <li>Other Czech writers, such as <i>V. Nezval, K. Biebl, K.
        Teige, J. Seifert </i>were on the cutting edge of the
        avant-garde of poetism and surrealism. In 1984 Seifert
        became the first Czech writer to be awarded the Nobel
        Prize for literature. </li>
    <li>Up to the end of World War II the Czech lands were also
        home to several German and Jewish writers living in
        Prague: <i>Rainer Maria Rilke, Franz Werfel and Max Brod.</i>
    </li>
    <li>After 1948, literature was materially and intellectually
        impoverished by the imposition of a centralized state
        ideology. Not until the 1960s as the communist regime
        eased did a new literary generation arise and efforts to
        renew contacts with Europe were revived. </li>
    <li>However, the short period of artistic freedom ended in
        August 1968 with the invasion of the armies of the Warsaw
        Pact. The majority of the most important authors of the
        generation continued their work abroad; or their samizdat
        works circulated during the following two decades only in
        typed copies. Among these were the internationally
        renowned authors: </li>
    <li>The emigre prose writers Milan Kundera, Arnost Lustig,
        Egon Hostovsky and Josef Skvorecky, and those who stayed
        home, Ludvik Vaculik, Ladislav Fuks, Bohumil Hrabal and
        Ivan Klima. </li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="g4">THEATER </a></h5>

<ul>
    <li>The theatre has played a crucial role in the history of
        the Czech nation. So much more fitting that today, <i>Vaclav
        Havel</i>, the country's most famous dissident playwright
        is also the president of the republic. Among his most
        famous absurdist plays, which have been translated and
        performed all over the world, are Temptation, Memorandum
        and The Garden Party. </li>
    <li>Havel, along with fellow playwrights like <i>Josef Topol</i>,
        were tapping into a long theatrical tradition that began
        in the 12th century. </li>
    <li>In 1862 the first permanent Czech theater Prozatimni
        divadlo (The Provisional Theater) was opened. The
        National Theater has stood as a strong symbol of national
        independence since it opened in 1881, thanks to public
        donations and collections. The first performance at the
        theatre was Smetana's Libuse, an opera based on the
        legendary founding of the city of Prague. Although it
        burned down afterwards it re-opened in 1883. </li>
    <li>Between 1927 and 1938 the Osvobozene divadlo (The
        Liberated Theater) served as a breeding ground for a new
        genre of satiric political commentary developed by the
        authors and actors <i>J. Voskovec and J. Werich.</i> </li>
    <li>After World War II regional theaters began to open. At
        the end of the 1950s theater life was revived with the
        creation of several small theaters: Divadlo Na Zabradli -
        Theater on the Balustrade, Semafor Theater, Divadlo za
        Branou - Theater Beyond the Gate (at present Divadlo za
        Branou II), and Cinoherni klub. </li>
    <li>Czech stage design (<i>F. Troster, F. Muzika, J. Capek,
        J. Svoboda </i>- the founder of Laterna Magica) enjoyed
        great success abroad as did ballet (<i>P. Smok</i>), mime
        (<i>L. Fialka, B. Hybner, B. Polivka</i>) and puppet
        theater (Spejbl a Hurvinek Theatre, Vychodoceske loutkove
        divadlo DRAK - East Bohemian Puppet Theater DRAK in
        Hradec Kralove). </li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="g5">F</a>ILM </h5>

<p>Czech filmmaking leaped into the international spotlight over
the past couple of decades thanks to the work of directors <i>Milos
Forman and Jiri Menzel</i>, whose films are played in moviehouses
all over the world. Forman won Oscar awards for his films One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus and Menzel secured one
for Ostre sledovane vlaky/Closely Watched Trains. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Film history in the Czech Republic goes back to 1898 when
        the first ones were produced by <i>J. Krizenecky</i>. The
        film era began to really take off in the country when
        permanent movie theatres started operating in 1907 and
        with the arrival of permanent film distributors in 1909. </li>
    <li>In the 1930s Czech writers and cinematographers began
        making headway in the production of exceptional artistic
        films, documentaries and the first sound newsreels. </li>
    <li>In 1945 Czechoslovak cinematography was nationalized.
        However its growth was slowed down after February 1948
        when communist leaders started to interfere in film
        production and pushed the production of propaganda
        films.At that time puppet films by <i>J. Trnka </i>and
        cartoons and feature films by <i>K. Zeman and J.
        Svankmajer </i>achieved world wide fame. </li>
    <li>In the 1960s productions by young artists formed the
        so-called Czech New Wave. Both Forman and Menzel were a
        part of this wave along with <i>J. Jires, V. Chytilova,
        J. Nemec, E. Schorm and F. Vlacil</i>. After the
        Soviet-led invasion in 1968 a series of films were locked
        away and prohibited. Among them J. Kadar‚s and E.
        Klos‚s Obchod na korze /The Shop on the Main Street/,
        which was awarded an Oscar in 1966, and J. Menzel‚s
        Ostre sledovane vlaky /Closely Watched Trains/, which
        received the same award the following year. </li>
    <li>The most important modern film festivals which take place
        in the Czech Republic are the International Film Festival
        in Karlovy Vary and the Children‚s Film Festival in
        Zlin. </li>
    <li>Every year the Czech Republic produces approximately 30
        feature films and 1,200 documentaries and cartoons. </li>
    <li>Recently, the state film industry went through economic
        transformation and privatization. A network of private
        film companies and distributors is now operating in the
        country. <br>
