face="Times New Roman CE"><br>
At the beginning of this century the territory of the Czech
Republic was one of the most economically developed parts of
Europe and was the most industrialized part of the former
Austro-Hungarian Empire.<strong> Between the two world wars, the
Czech lands were listed among the ten most developed states of
the world. </strong><br>
<br>
After the Second World War, however, the Czech state came under
the Soviet sphere of influence and for forty years was the victim
of communist experimentation. Market relations were deeply
repressed, market institutions were liquidated and industry,
land, and trade were completely nationalized and submitted to
central control. The whole country went through a long and
destructive economic period of stagnation and actual decline in
some areas. </font>The mass production put more stress on
quantity rather than quality. The central plan answered the
questions How much ? and What to produce ? and the natural
function of market (determination of price, quality and quantity)
was bypassed. The system was very ineffective and the products
were not competitive. Therefore the majority of foreign trade
could have been done only with other communistic countries.<br>
<br>
<font face="Times New Roman CE">Despite this stagnation, even
under the communists many companies maintained or built-up
relatively respectable reputations: </font></p>

opened the road to economic reversal and the reintroduction of a
market economy through <strong>economic transformation,</strong>
which drew upon five basic measures: <br>

- privatization programs <br>

    <li><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>The private
        sector has begun to prevail</strong> in the economy and
        its influence on general economic development is steadily
        increasing. Millions of Czechs participated in the unique
        coupon privatization scheme. The process enabled citizens
        to purchase inexpensive coupon booklets of privatization
        points which they could exchange for shares in companies.
        </font>Today the state owns only the strategic and huge
        companies which are slowly being privatized. </li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>The goods and
        labour market is quickly developing and capital market
        has been established.</strong> </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>The foreign
        currency exchange rate has been stabilized</strong> (for
        the past 8 years it has been maintained at approximately
        CZK 30-40 to USD 1, (CZK 18 to DEM l.) In 1994 the exchange
        rate was 1 USD to CZK 28.78 while in 1995 it decreased to
        CZK 26.14. After a long period of stabilization, it
        increased from May to December 1997 from roughly CZK 29
        to 32 to USD 1and from CZK 18.5 to CZK 19.5 to DEM 1
        (e.g. on May, 2000 it was 40.5 Kè to 1 USD and

        21,174 million USD (2,055 per capita.) The Czech
        government repaid all its loans to the International
        Monetary Fund in the summer of 1994 - two years ahead of
        time. </font></li>
    <li>The unemployment rate remains relatively low compared to

        of developed market economies in Czech exports and
        imports has been strengthened. In both exports and

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img src="blue_swirl32b0.gif"
width="15" height="13"> </b></font><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Gross Domestic Product </strong><br>
The noticeable decline in real gross domestic product (GDP)
during l991 slowed down and in 1993 the situation further
stabilized. GDP increased in the following years and, according
to government estimates, it is expected to rise further. From
1993 to 1996, GDP increased very quickly. In comparison with
1990, it has already reached 95%. In 1997, in the estimation from
December, dynamic growth decreased to 1.5%. </font>Currently
after the governmental packages in 1997 and strict monetary
policy of the CNB, the economy growth slowed down. For the first
time the real wages decreased, the growth of GDP January- April
1998 was -0.9%. The causes are mainly in the decrease of domestic
consumption, which was caused by the decreasing value of real
wages. The prime goal of the new government (formed after
elections in June 1998) is to start up sustainable and long-term
economic growth.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img src="blue_swirl32b0.gif"
width="15" height="13"> </b></font><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Industrial Production </strong><br>
The long-term decline of industrial production is a natural
process involving a decrease in the production of unnecessary
products and a reduction of the disproportionate amount of heavy
and light industry in gross domestic product. The loss of markets
in Slovakia after the split, and economic stagnation in Western
Europe are also playing a role. Of those large and medium-size
industrial enterprises already privatized by coupon
privatization, some have been harmed because new owners were slow
to take control of management. From the beginning of 1995,
industrial production began to increase and in 1997 reached 83%
of the level of 1990. </font>The newest number of industrial
production looks very positively, from January to May 1998 the
Industrial production grew by 7.1%. </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img src="blue_swirl32b0.gif"
width="15" height="13"> </b></font><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Consumer Prices </strong><br>
The complete liberalization of prices which began on January 1,
1991 led to an extreme but isolated rise in prices. The
introduction of value added tax (VAT) on 1.1.1993 brought another
</font>price shock<font face="Times New Roman CE">. Consumers
prices (inflation) are relatively stabile. After having fallen
below 10% of yearly inflation in 1995 until 1997, in 1998
inflation will reach more than 10% after the currency devaluation
and because of rent and energy prices liberalization. </font>Recently
the Central bank (CNB) has announced an inflation target which
the institution wants to reach (net inflation 5.5% - 6.5% in
1998). Therefore the bank introduced a strict monetary policy for
which it is criticized from many sides. The last indicators of
net inflation (6.5% June 1998) show that the CNB reaches its goal
quite successfully, therefore a slow decrease in interest rates
might come. </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img src="blue_swirl32b0.gif"
width="15" height="13"> </b></font><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Foreign trade </strong><br>
</font>The Czech Republic imported more than it exported, it is
presumably an essential and inevitable part of the transition
period. The market was completely unsaturated with foreign goods,
esp. goods from developed countries and the gap needed to be
filled. Another fact supporting this idea is the low level of
competitiveness of &quot;communistic goods&quot; and therefore
low demand from abroad. <br>
The trade balance deficit in the Czech Republic peaked in 1996 (<font
face="Times New Roman CE">5.8 billion USD</font>) and from than
on it gradually decreases, prediction for the year 1998 is 2.6
billion USD. <font face="Times New Roman CE">The territorial
structure of the Czech Republic's foreign trade turnover has
changed considerably since 1990. Trade with all post-Communist
states has decreased substantially while trade with the European
Union and European Free Trade Association countries has increased
significantly. Foreign trade capacity has been increasing
permanently, whereby since 1994 </font>increases in<font
face="Times New Roman CE"> imports gradually exceeded </font>increases
in<font face="Times New Roman CE"> exports. Foreign trade
turnover of industrial countries with a </font>developed<font
face="Times New Roman CE"> market economy is approx. 70%. Foreign
trade turnover of European countries with a transitive economy
including Commonwealth of Independent States (Russia) represents
a quarter only, whereby developing countries are represented by
5% only.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img src="blue_swirl32b0.gif"
width="15" height="13"> </b></font><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>State Budget </strong><br>
The state budget for l993 registered a slight surplus. Revenues
totaled CZK 358 billion and expenditure CZK 356.9 billion. The
government proposed a balanced state budget for 1994, which was
approved by Parliament. At the end of the first half of 1994, the
state budget registered a surplus of CZK 9.7 billion. The state
budget for 1996 had revenues of CZK 482.2 billion and expenditure
of CZK 484.3 billion </font>(deficit CZK 2.1billion)<font
face="Times New Roman CE">. </font>In<font
face="Times New Roman CE"> 1997</font>, the budget finished again
in slight deficit of CZK 15.7 billion. <font
face="Times New Roman CE">For 1998, a well balanced budget with
revenue</font>s <font face="Times New Roman CE">and expenses of
CZK 536.6 billion </font>was accepted<font
face="Times New Roman CE">.</font> In June 1998 the Social
Democratic Party formed the government and from their
proclamations the Czech Republic might experience slightly
deficit budget for the fiscal year 1999.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><img src="blue_swirl32b0.gif"
width="15" height="13"> </b></font><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Exchange Rate </strong><br>
In 1990 the Czechoslovak currency was depreciated three times
thus deflating the artificially high exchange rate of the crown.
Since May 1993 the Czech crown has been pegged to the two most
important world currencies - USD and DEM - fluctuating only to
the extent that the exchange rate between these two currencies
fluctuates. The rate of exchange was firming up from CZK 29 for
USD 1 in 1990 up to CZK 26 and 27 in 1995 and 1996 and the Czech
crown ranked among freely convertible currencies. In June 1997,
the State Bank declared a &quot;free floating rate&quot;. The
rate of the Czech crown sank and in 1997, it has been fluctuating
between CZK 32 and 35 to 1 USD and between CZK 18.5 and 19.5 to 1
DEM. </font>In spring 1998 the currency appreciated dramatically
and reached values of CZK 17.5 for DEM 1 and CZK 30.0 for USD 1.
This situation is mainly caused by the interest rate differential
between local and world interest rates. The differential attracts
short term capital and assures relatively risk free profits. The
Central bank keeps the interest rates high because of its
inflationary goals. <a href="http://www.CNB.cz/gg/e/cnb98.htm">(official

</font>The Czech government announced a <a href="incentives.html">7-point

the natural advantages of the country’s location even more
attractive to new investors and to bring the Czech Republic into
line with its competitors for mobile inward investment, namely
Poland, Hungary and leading western European countries. The Czech
Republic offers to investors stable political and economic
environment and low level of wages compared to standards in
western countries. Moreover the labour force is highly skilled
and easy to adopt new methods of working. </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">The capital market emerged in
1993. Crucial practical steps were taken for the development of
stocks and shares in the Czech Republic during 1994. These
processes led to the creation of the Stock Exchange of Securities
Praha, and the stock trading agency known as RM-System. Stock and
shares are traded on the Stock Exchange. Currently the </font><a

face="Times New Roman CE"> has </font>83 (April 1998) m<font
face="Times New Roman CE">embers who are entitled to trade </font>with
412 issues (1997 number)<font face="Times New Roman CE">. Other
interested parties have access to the market only through the
mediation of these members. </font>New institutions such as Stock
exchange commission are observing the correctness of trading on
the market.<font face="Times New Roman CE"><br>
</font>After the privatization the stock market had 1750 issues,
this amount was too large and there were many titles with low
liquidity, the market was very diluted and unorganized. In recent
years the shares undergo a selection and only the companies which
fulfill criteria set by the Prague Stock Exchange can stay on the
main market. <font face="Times New Roman CE">In the framework of
the automatic electronic securities market, the RM-System is used
mainly by minor investors who acquired their shares through
coupon privatization and who have difficulty gaining access to
the Stock Exchange. On the whole, trading is done within the
framework of the RM-S with </font>a<font
face="Times New Roman CE">pproximately l,l00 securities.</font> </p>
