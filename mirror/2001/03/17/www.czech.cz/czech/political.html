name="HISTORY"><font size="5">HISTORY</font></a></h4>

<p>After World War II, the political system in Czechoslovakia was
greatly affected by the introduction of a Soviet-style Communist
regime, as it was in the other countries of central and eastern
Europe. The system of power was distorted. In effect this
imbalance meant that the three branches of power necessary for
democratic development - executive, legislative and judicial -
were substituted by a unified Communist power. Its power was
based on the constitution and for forty years it ruled all layers
of social and political life throughout the country with the help
of oppressive institutions. After February 1948, the Communist
Party became the only autonomous political entity. It allowed a
few other parties to exist within the so-called National Front;
however, these parties held no real power and were created to
provide an outward image of Czechoslovakia as a democratic state.
</p>

<p>After the revolutionary events of November 1989 which brought
about the downfall of the Communist regime, the entire country
faced the uneasy task of resuming its pre-Communist traditions
and building a democratic political system. A wide diversity of
political parties were well-established even before the break-up
of Czechoslovakia on December 31, 1992. The constitution of the
Czech Republic, which became valid on the day of the birth of the
new state, explicitly defined civil rights, the relationship
between the executive and legislative branches of power, and the
independence of the judiciary. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hrad.cz"><b>The President</b></a> <br>
Elected for a term of five years by a joint session of both
chambers of Parliament, the President may serve a maximum of two
successive terms in office. The President is the Supreme
Commander of the Armed Forces. Presidential power is limited; the
most important is the right to veto any bill which has already
been passed by Parliament, with the exception of constitutional
bills. This power is void in times of constitutional or other
political crises. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.psp.cz"><b>Parliament</b></a> <br>
The Parliament consists of two chambers - the Chamber of Deputies
and the Senate. It passes all bills valid in the territory of the
Czech Republic and expresses approval of important international
treaties; i.e. those concerning human rights and basic liberties,
political treaties, and general economic treaties. It decides the
most important acts of state, such as declaring war or approving
the deployment of foreign armies on Czech soil. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.psp.cz"><b>Chamber of Deputies</b></a> <br>
The Chamber of Deputies is made up of 200 deputies who are
elected for a term of four years (the last elections took place
in June 1998). The President can dissolve the Chamber of Deputies
in cases outlined in the constitution. Political lobbies, ongoing
parliamentary commissions and committees operate in the
historical building which houses the chamber. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.senat.cz"><b>Senate</b></a> <br>
The Senate is made up of 81 senators elected for six-year terms.
Every two years one-third of the Senate&#146;s seats come up for
re-election. The Senate cannot be dissolved. </p>

<p>Parliamentary Activity: <br>
A resolution by a parliamentary chamber is passed by a clear
majority of deputies or senators present. A constitutional bill
or an international treaty must be passed by a 60% majority of
the total number of deputies and senators present. </p>

<p><b>The Legislative Process:</b> <br>
Bills are sent to the Chamber of Deputies. The right of
legislative initiative is possessed by a deputy, a group of
deputies, the Senate, the Cabinet or local or regional cabinet
representatives. <br>
A bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies is sent to the Senate
which has the power to veto it, send it back to the Chamber of
Deputies with amendments, or table the bill. </p>

<p><b>Elections to the Legislative Bodies:</b> <br>
Elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate take place by
secret ballot on the basis of general, equal and direct voting.
The Chamber of Deputies is elected on the basis of proportional
representation. Political parties must obtain five percent of the
popular vote in order to gain seats in the chamber. The Senate is
elected on the basis of majority vote. <br>
All citizens of the Czech Republic over 18 years of age have the
right to vote for representatives in both chambers of Parliament.
Candidates for the Chamber of Deputies must be over 21 years of
age, while candidates for the Senate must be over 40 years of
age. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.vlada.cz/index.eng.htm"><b>The Government</b></a>

Consists of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and
Ministers, and coordinates activities of the ministries and the
central bodies of the state administration and manages the state
administration throughout the territory of the state. The
Government has exclusive legislative initiative in terms of the
state budget. </p>

<p><b>The Supreme Audit Office</b> <br>
The Supreme Audit Office is an independent controlling agency
which audits the management of state property and the
implementation of the state budget. It audits the ways in which
the resources of the state budget of the Czech Republic are
created and used. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnb.cz/en/index.html"><b>The Czech
National Bank</b></a> <br>
This is the central state bank of the Czech Republic. <br>
Based on law, the main goal of the bank is to preserve the
stability and purchasing power of the currency, and while
pursuing this goal, the bank is not dependent on the cabinet of
the Czech Republic. The president and executives of the bank are
appointed by the Head of State.</p>

<p><strong>The Czech Republic is a parliamentary democracy</strong></p>

<p>In 1989, after overthrowing the one-party government,
Czechoslovak citizens found new freedom - the right to freely
form political parties and movements according to one's political
convictions. Very soon after the fall of the totalitarian regime,
a colorful variety of political parties was established and
provided the foundations for a more stable political climate. </p>

<p>In the 1992 elections the majority of votes gained the
coalition of ODS - KDS (33,4 %). In the Czech Republic a
governmental coalition is formed (ODS -KDS - ODA - KDU-CSL).
Prime Minister is Vaclav Klaus (ODS)</p>

<p>In the 1996 elections sixteen political parties and movements
participated. Six of them obtained 5% or more of the popular vote
in the Czech Republic. The three strongest government coalition
parties (ODS, KDU - CSL, ODA), obtained 99 mandates in the
Chamber of Deputies and 52 mandates in the Senate. The government
was center and right oriented and tried to finish the
transformation process of the Czech republic. Prime Minister is
Vaclav Klaus (ODS).</p>

<p><font color="#000000">In December 1997 the coalition parties </font>(ODS,
KDU - CSL, ODA) were forced to resign due to collapse of
coalition which was mainly caused by the long-term disagreements
within the coalition, several scandals with financing the parties
and also due to worsening of economic performance of the Czech
Republic. </p>

<p>In January<font color="#000000"> 1998 </font>the new temporary
government of Mr. To&#154;ovský was appointed. <font
color="#000000">The task was to prepare the country for the early
elections. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">In June 1998 the early elections were
held and the Czech Social Democratic Party gained the majority of
votes (32,3 %). After few weeks of negotiations among all the
parties finally CSSD formed a minority government following a
procedural agreement with the ODS (27,74). For the first time
after the year 1989 a left oriented party rules in the Czech
Republic. Prime minister is Milos Zeman (CSSD).</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) is a right-wing conservative
party founded in April 1991. ODS pushed through rapid economic
reforms in Czechoslovakia and than in the Czech Republic. ODS
promotes a liberal economy ruling without major state
interventions. In 1996 ODS became once again the leading part of
governmental coalition but the government didn&#146;t have
majority in the Deputy Chamber of Parliament. In the year 1997 a
campaign finance scandal caused that several top party officials
defected in January 1998 to form the Freedom Union. For the 1998
elections the party mounted an aggressive PR campaign to stop the
decreasing trend in voters support. The party wants strong ties
with Western Europe, supports NATO and European Union membership
as well as the development of stronger local and regional
government.<br>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
While the Communists have distanced themselves from the 1948-89
era, they continue to advocate a state-regulated economy and
higher taxes for the rich. Their platform also calls for free
education, free health care, a 35-hour work week and measures
against the &quot;Americanization&quot; of Czech culture (through
broadcasting regulations, for example). They want to review
controversial privatizations, stop privatization and reverse the
deregulation of rents and utility costs.<br>
The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia failed to transform itself
into a modern left-wing party of the kind which exists in
neighboring countries. It is the last of the former totalitarian
parties in Central Europe to retain the name
&#145;Communist.&#146; Splinter groups have broken off from the
party because of internal divisions, leading to the establishment
of several new parties. The Communist Party of Bohemia and
Moravia (KSCM) holds 24 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 2
seats in the Senate.<br>

Founded on December 26, 1989, the SPR-RSC is an extremely
nationalistic right-wing party similar to the German Republicans
and the French Republican Party. Party has a large support among
young skinhead groups. Their manifesto calls for radical
restrictions on state intervention in the economy and as well as
on foreign business in the Czech Republic; lowering taxes; a
declaration of neutrality and refusal to join NATO; no
negotiations with Germany on reparations for Sudeten Germans
expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War II; free education
and social benefits; a reintroduction of the death penalty;
restrictions on immigration; the cancellation of
&quot;illegitimate benefits&quot; for Gypsies and the absolute
prohibition on the production, distribution and use of drugs. In
the elections 1998 the party received only 3,9 % thus they have
no representatives in Chamber of Deputies. </p>

decreased in real terms since 1989. In March, support for the DZJ
rose above the 5 percent minimum necessary to gain seats in
Parliament. Though the market-oriented parties have dismissed the
DZJ as communists, they are unlikely to win over many DZJ
