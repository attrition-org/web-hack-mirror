<p><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Media <br>
</strong>Political freedom after the year 1989 resulted in an
enormous boom in all types of media, which had been censored for
forty years. At present organisations monitoring freedom of the
press rank the Czech Republic among those countries with the
highest standards of press freedom. Dozens of new periodicals and
broadcasting stations, and several TV channels emerged at both
national and regional level. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">The newly established market
has already experienced varying degrees of success. In 1996,
5,028 journals and magazines were being published in Czech
Republic. 10,224 book titles were published in the same year.
About 53,824,000 book titles have been loaned from public
libraries. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">The share of foreign investors
- mainly Swiss and German, is quite significant in the most
important newspapers. The Swiss syndicate Ringier owns one of the
most widely read tabloids - Blesk, the more sophisticated Lidové
noviny, and more than ten other main periodicals. The regional
press in Bohemia is controlled, with only a few exceptions, by
three subsidiary companies of Passauer Neue Presse, the German
publishing company.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Daily periodicals <br>
</strong>90 national and regional dailies </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">The following are the most
popular daily newspapers distributed throughout the Czech
Republic (average daily circulation is listed in parentheses). </font></p>

<p><a href="http://trafika.mediaserver.cz/mf/"><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Mladá Fronta Dnes</strong></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman CE"> (425,000) The largest independent
national daily newspaper. Formerly published under the communist

</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Blesk </strong>(300,000)
This independent, colour tabloid daily is published seven days a

of having high professional standards.<br>
</font></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vol.cz/NEWTONIT/noviny/zn/"><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Zemské noviny</strong></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong> </strong>(formerly Èeské a

(125,000) This economic daily paper features news on economic

</font></p>

<p><a href="http://trafika.mediaserver.cz/ln/"><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Lidové noviny</strong></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman CE"> (80,000) Famous as a dissident
newspaper published by the illegal samizdat press under the
communists, it is now an independent daily aimed at a
liberally-minded and university-educated readership.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Weekly Papers
and Monthly Periodicals <br>
</strong></font><font face="Times New Roman CE">Just as with
daily papers, the successors of magazines which existed before
1989 are among the nation's favourite periodicals. However,
several new magazines founded after 1990 are also popular. Here,
too, foreign capital has brought many changes - notably in
improvement in print quality and lay-out. At the same time, the
content of new magazines has started to approach international
standards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">The most widely read
periodicals are general interest weeklies such as Kvìty, </font><a
href="http://www.ringier.cz/reflex/"><font
face="Times New Roman CE">Reflex</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman CE">, </font><a

href="http://cech.cesnet.cz/locals/MS.html"><font
face="Times New Roman CE"> Mladý svìt.</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman CE"> In addition, a wide array of new
titles have emerged to fill the demands of special niche markets
ranging from magazines that cater to women to publications that
focus on sports. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">Two English weeklies are
published in Prague - The Prague Post and The Central European
Business Weekly. One glossy business magazine is published in
French and English - La Tribune De Prague<br>
In German is published <b>Prager Zeitung.</b> This weekly paper features news and analysis about economy, politics and culture in Czech Republic, Eastern Europe and European Union.<br>

</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Radio and
Television <br>
</strong></font><font face="Times New Roman CE">The Czech
Republic has a dual state and private broadcasting system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">At this time the only
operators recognised by law are the publicly owned institutions </font><a
href="http://www.radio.cz/"><font face="Times New Roman CE">Czech
Radio</font></a><font face="Times New Roman CE"> and </font><a
href="http://www.czech-tv.cz/"><font face="Times New Roman CE">Czech
Television</font></a><font face="Times New Roman CE">. They have
an arms-length relationship with the government and finance their
own activities. These institutions have a specific mission in
regard to upholding public interest and they are limited in
developing their own business, particularly as regards
advertising. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">The Council for Radio and
Television Broadcasting in the Czech Republic administers
licensing policy. The council is elected by parliament and is not
dependent on the government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">At present, over 70 licences
for radio broadcasting have been granted, and there are 150 radio
stations. The largest licensed radio stations operating in the
Czech Republic include Radio<strong> KISS 98 FM, Impuls, Radio Frekvence
1, </strong></font><a href="http://www.evropa2.cz/"><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Radio Evropa 2</strong></font></a><font

href="http://www.radio.cz/cesky_rozhlas/svevropa/index.html"><font
face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Radio Free Europe. </strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">52 television licenses have
been granted. There are two state television stations and two
private independent stations - Nova and Prima. State television
broadcasting covers the whole area of the Czech Republic. There
are 118 television broadcasting stations in the country.<br>
Nova was the first private television station in the former
Eastern bloc to receive a broadcasting license. It went on air
Feb. 4, 1994 and within six months had secured half the viewing
audience in the Czech Republic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Advertising <br>
</strong>Since 1989, advertising expenditure has increased
dramatically - from almost five million dollars in 1989 to more
than 212 million dollars in 1993. It is estimated that in 1994
total expenditure on advertising had increased to 250 million
dollars. <br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">After 1989, international
advertising agencies quickly became the largest in the country in
terms of turnover. Most of the successful Czech agencies merged
with foreign partners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>The five largest
agencies</strong> (in terms of turnover in 1996 in mil. USD) </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">1. Mark/BBDO 36.2 <br>
2. McCann-Ericson 35.4<br>

5. Young &amp; Rubicam 24.0<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman CE"><strong>Telecommunications
</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">Telecommunications in the
Czech Republic have not yet reached the standards of developed
countries. On the other hand, huge customer demand and ambitious
plans for the future make this one of the most promising areas
for development and investment. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman CE">Number of main
telephone participant lines (without branch lines): <br>
1980 - 1,108,000 <br>
1990 - 1,623,000 <br>
1996 - 2,816,000, </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman CE">(1,855,000 of this last figure
were home lines. Approximately 45% of households have their own
telephone. The number of mobile telephones now stands at some
204,000. 900 million USD has been invested from abroad into the
telephone network. By the end of the year, 577,000 households and
entrepreneurs asked for a new telephone line. <br>
