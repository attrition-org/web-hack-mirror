<hr>

<p>The most popular sports in the Czech Republic are football
(soccer), ice hockey, volley-ball, tennis and kickball (an
original Czech sport similar to volley-ball in which the players
kick the ball over a low net.) </p>

<p>The most famous Czech sports grouping is the mass
participation Sokol organisation. Although the main goal of Sokol
is to promote national health and sports, it played a key role in
the national resistance to the Austrian Empire, the Nazi
occupation and the Communist regime. Soon after it was founded in
1862, colourful gymnastics rallies were held regularly in Prague
until the German occupation in 1938. The Communist regime banned
the organisation after its 1948 rally, but Sokol continued to
exist abroad. In July 1994, Sokol staged a triumphant return with
a rally in Prague. </p>
