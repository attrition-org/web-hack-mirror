<p>Thanks to its long and rich history and the diversity of its
natural environment, the Czech Republic is a great attraction for
the millions of guests who visit it every year. <b>The jewel in
the Czech crown is Prague with its gorgeous and rich
architectural styles but the country is also dotted with numerous
historical city centers, castles and chateaux. </b>Outside the
urban areas, deep woods, rock formations and limestone caves are
among the many interesting sites the Czech Republic has to offer.
<br>
Since the Czech lands lie exactly on the border of Eastern and
Western Europe, the country has come under the influence of
several different cultures throughout the course of history. Each
of these influences indelibly marked the face of the country with
architectural or artistic monuments. This accounts for the <b>uniquely
rich cultural heritage of this relatively small country</b>. In
addition, the Czech lands are extraordinary in Europe due to the
fact that they are practically untouched by the large-scale
destruction of war. </p>

        unique atmosphere of the city, which has been called the <b>&quot;heart
        of Europe&quot; </b>for ages. Among the most fascinating

        historical parts of Prague - Hradcany (the Prague
        Castle), the Lesser Town (Mala Strana) and the Old Town
        (Stare Mesto). These areas, which virtually amount to
        small unique cities within the larger city have their own
        particular features. Hradcany, the large-scale,
        historically rich complex, has been the residence and
        symbol of Czech statehood for centuries. The grandiose
        Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral, dominates the Lesser Town
        roofs and offers a beautiful view of dozens of Old Town
        towers. Charles Bridge, the oldest stone bridge in
        Central Europe, connects the two historic sites of the
        city. Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and especially in the
        Old Town - Art Nouveau, cubism and modern styles from the

<p>The Czech Republic is located in the Central European Time
zone. In line with neighbouring countries it uses the so-called
summer time from the last Sunday in March until the last Saturday
in September ( summer time means a 1 hour shift of time ahead
from normal Central European Time). </p>

<p>The Czech cuisine is rich in meat, most usually served with
dumplings or potatoes. Among the most common meals are various
kinds of goulash, beef with special cream sauce ( svickova ) or
other sauces with various flavors (dill, tomato, etc.) The real
Czech specialty, dumplings filled with fruit, are not often
included on the menus of most restaurants. In the centers of big
cities, even the lower grade restaurants serve select meals from
international cuisine including fish and poultry meals. Venison
is popular, too. </p>

<p>Czech beer is one of the best in the world (Pilsen, Budvar and
Velkopopovicke beer are among the finest). Excellent wine is
produced in South Moravia and the Bohemian regions around
Zernoseky and Roudnice. A rather unique drink is the Czech herb
liqueur, Becherovka. In central Moravia, in the area around
Vizovice, plum brandy (slivovice) is very popular. It contains up
to 90% alcohol. </p>
