<p>The divide between the two principal mountain systems in
Europe - the Hercynian and Alpine-Himalayan - runs through Czech
territory. The country's topography is therefore quite varied:
plains (4.5% of the country), hills (50.1%) highlands (33.9%) and
mountains (11,6%). Altitude levels: lowland regions under 200 m
above sea level make up 4.95% of the country, regions 200 - 500 m
above sea level make up 74.1%, regions 600 - 1,000m above sea
level 19.3% and regions over 1,000 m above sea level 1.6%. </p>

<p>The Czech Republic is called the roof of Europe since its only
source of water is atmospheric rain and snowfall. All the rivers
which have their source in the area drain into neighboring
countries. <br>
<b>The Czech Republic has three river basins:</b> <br>
The Labe (Elbe) River Basin (drains into the North Sea) - 51,399
sq.km. Main rivers: Labe, Vltava <br>
The Odra (Oder) River Basin (drains into the Baltic) - 4,721
sq.km. Main rivers: Odra, Opava, Ostravice and Ol&#154;e <br>
The Dunaj (Danube) River Basin (drains into the Black Sea) -
22,744 sq. km. Main rivers: Morava, Dyje <br>
The river basins intersect at Kralický Sni3ník on the Polish
border. </p>

<p><b>Lakes and ponds</b> <br>
There are 455 natural lakes in the Czech Republic, 350 of which
are river lakes that have formed in the grasslands of larger
rivers. A characteristic feature of the Czech landscape is the
large number of artificial lakes created for fish-farming. They
number 21,800 in total and cover about 41,000 hectares. The
largest of them are Lake Rozmberk and Lake Bezdrev in southern
Bohemia. </p>

large and renowned spas have been founded around natural or

as well as in Mariánské Lázne, Franti&#154;kovy Lázne,
Podebrady, Luhacovice, Jáchymov, and many others which are
smaller but still therapeutically important. The warmest Czech
springs include the famous Thermal Spring in Karlovy Vary (72oC),
and springs in Teplice (42oC) and Janské Lázni (29.6oC). The
waters from former uranium mines in Jáchymov have the highest
radioactivity in the world (5,085 Mach units, .08 oz.Rn/gal.) </p>

Europe, which makes for pleasantly mild summers and winters with
only moderate amounts of precipitation. <br>
Lowland temperatures in July average 20oC, {Prague 19.5oC} and in

name="POPULATION"><strong>POPULATION </strong></a></p>

<p>According to a 1997 census, the Czech Republic has a
population of 10.3 million people, 5 million males and 5.3
million females. Three quarters of the population live in urban
areas. <br>
The population density is 131 inhabitants per sq. km, while the
total growth in population in the Czech Republic is 0.8 persons
per 1,000 inhabitants. </p>

<p><b>Population Growth</b> <br>
Until 1994, an outstanding feature of the Czech Republic was its
stable population growth, with the exception of the period of the
two world wars. Since 1994, however, the population has been
decreasing and is expected to have fallen to around 10 million by
2020. </p>

<p><b>Birth rate</b> <br>
After WW II, the number of births fell from over 200,000 a year
to less than 150,000 in 1970. In 1974 this figure had increased
to 195,000 but by 1996 had fallen gradually to 90,000. The number
of new-born babies per 1,000 inhabitants was 8.8 % in 1996. </p>

<p><b>Death rate</b> <br>
The number of deaths per 1,000 inhabitants gradually increased
from World War II until 1983 (13.0%). Since then it has decreased
and in 1996 it was only 10.9 %, thus corresponding to western
European levels. </p>

occurred, except for a relatively high number of Romany
new-arrivals from Slovakia. Although just 33,000 people declared
themselves as Romany in the 1991 census, there are estimated to

The degree of education completion at elementary, secondary and
university levels is very high in the Czech Republic compared to
world standards. All children in the Czech Republic must attend
elementary school up to the age of 15. Upon finishing elementary
school, 52% of children continue their education in vocational
schools and 48% move on to secondary schools. 7.2% of Czechs
complete a university education. </p>

<p>Over the period 1980-1991, there was an increase in the number
of people completing each level of education. The proportion of
people who only completed primary education dropped sharply
(index 76.8%), while the number of people with higher education
grew. The highest increase could be observed for university
education (index 148.1%), and for postgraduate education (index
139.0%). </p>

<p>According to the population census in 1991, 33% of the
population over 15 years of age had received a basic education,
while 30% had finished secondary professional education, 28% had
finished secondary universal or professional education and 7.2%
had finished university education with a minimum of four
years&#146; study. 1.8% of the population did not state any
education in the census or said they had not received any
education. </p>

<p>Between 1991 and 1996, 93,531 persons finished university
education, i.e. an average of under 19,000 persons per year. In
1997, 23.9 % of the population over 15 years of age had received
a primary (elementary) education, 34.1% had finished secondary
professional education, 29.2 % had graduated from secondary
universal or professional schools and 7.8% of the population over

not received any education. </p>

Central planning biased the structure of employment by placing a
grossly disproportionate emphasis on industry, to the detriment
of the service sector. Economic transformation is correcting this
imbalance, however, with employment rising in services and
declining in industry. In 1989 a relatively small percentage of
the population worked in agriculture and the number is still
dropping. </p>
