<p><b>Around the 4th century B.C. the present-day Czech Republic
was populated by Celts. </b>They were the first ethnic group to
arrive in the area, according to historical evidence. The Celtic
Boii tribe gave the country its Latin name - Boiohaemum
(Bohemia). They were pushed out by the German tribes (Marcomanni,
Quidi) before the beginning of our era. </p>

<p><b>At the end of 5th and the beginning of 6th century Slavs
settled in the territory of Bohemia and Moravia </b>during the
period known as the Migration of Peoples. The first half of the
7th century marks the first successful attempt to unite Slavonic
tribes. The so-called &quot;Samo's kingdom&quot; resisted the
pressure of the powerful Avar empire centered in the Hungarian
lowlands, and defended its territory against the forces of the
Frank attackers from the west, with partial success. </p>

<h5><a name="c2"><b>The Great Moravian Empire </b></a>(the last
two-thirds of the 9th century - destroyed by the Magyars in the
years 903-907) </h5>

<p>The culture of the Great Moravian Empire greatly influenced
the development of culture and religion among the Eastern and
Southern Slavs in the Middle Ages. In 863, the Byzantine
Christian missionaries Constantin and Methodius came to Moravia
to introduce Slavic liturgy there. Very soon, however, the
influence of the Roman Catholic Church expanded, proving to be
decisive in the course of the history of Bohemia and Moravia. </p>

<h4><a name="c3">The Premyslid Dynasty </a>(9th century - 1306) </h4>

<p>Bohemia became the center of an independent state-building
process. During the reign of the native Premyslid dynasty, <b>the
Czech state gradually grew in strength </b>and succeeded in
preserving its actual sovereignty despite formal vassal ties to
the Holy Roman Empire. </p>

<p>935 - death of Prince Wenceslas, the patron saint of Bohemia </p>

<p>973-976 - establishment of the Prague Bishopric </p>

<p>1085 - Vratislav became the first Bohemian prince to be
granted the right to use a royal title, as a reward for his
support of the Emperor Henry IV during the struggle with Pope
Gregory VII </p>

<p><b>1212 - Premysl Otakar I received The Golden Bull of Sicily,
a decree proclaiming Bohemia a kingdom and Bohemian princes
hereditary kings</b>, and also declaring the indivisibility of
the kingdom of Bohemia and regulating the relationship of the
realm to the Holy Roman Empire. Bohemia then became one of the
most important states within the framework of the Empire. </p>

<p>1253-1278 - the reign of the powerful king Premysl Otakar II
was characterized by a policy of expansion of power. This
expansionist tendency was continued during the reigns of the last
Premyslid kings as well. </p>

<p>1306 - the murder of Wenceslas III and the Premyslid dynasty
dies out in the spear - side. </p>

<h5><a name="c4">The Luxembourg Dynasty </a>(1310 - 1437) </h5>

<p>The reign of the dynasty began when John of Luxembourg
(1310-1346) was elected King of Bohemia in 1310. The Luxembourg
kings added new regions to their kingdom. This realm was named
The Crownlands of Bohemia, a term made official by a decree of
Charles IV in 1348. The official Crownlands were made up of the
kingdom of Bohemia and the so-called adjoining lands - the
margravate of Moravia, the Silesian principalities, Upper Lusatia
and, from 1368, Lower Lusatia too. </p>

<p><b>The kingdom of Bohemia reached its height of power and
prestige during the reign of Charles IV (1346-1378)</b>, the
second Luxembourg on the throne of Bohemia: In 1344, the Prague
Archbishopric was founded. He established Charles University in
1348 - it was the first university founded north of the Alps.
Charles IV was crowned Roman Emperor in Rome in 1355. </p>

<h5><a name="c5"></a>The Hussite Revolution (1419 - 1436) </h5>

<p>Several conditions led to the creation of the Hussite reform
movement. The first was the economic and political crisis during
the reign of Wenceslas IV (1378-1419), the successor of Charles
IV. This crisis was exacerbated by the problems in Europe of this
time (the Great Schism, criticism of the Church). The Hussite
movement was inspired by the ideas of Master Jan Hus, a preacher
who was burnt at the stake in 1415 at Constance. Despite his
death, his supporters successfully continued in their efforts to
reform the Church. </p>

<p>Heir to the crown of Bohemia, the Roman Emperor Sigismund,
tried to defeat the growing revolution with force, but <b>the
Hussites defeated his five consecutive crusades in the years
1420-1431</b>. Only the victory of 1434, when the moderates
defeated the radicals, opened the way for a temporary agreement
between Hussite Bohemia and Catholic Europe. This agreement, The
Compacts of Basle was proclaimed in 1436 and confirmed the
Hussite denomination, and would later be paralleled by the
Reformation of the 16th century. <b>The Hussite movement changed
the structure of society in many ways. It created religious
dualism for the first time in Christian Europe. </b>There was a
decline in the power and prosperity of the Church from which the
nobility and towns were able to profit. The Czech nation and
Czech culture came to the forefront of social life. In the years
of unrest, a Czech noble - George of Podebrady, a skillful
diplomat and a man of outstanding personality, became the leader
of Czech political life. He was elected King of Bohemia in 1458.
His diplomatic activities - notably his effort to establish a
peace confederation of the European sovereigns - even reached
beyond the horizon of central Europe. </p>

<h5><a name="c6">The Jagellon Dynasty</a> (1471-1526) </h5>

<p>1471-1516 - Vladislav Jagellon, a son of King Cazimir of
Poland, was elected King of Bohemia. </p>

<p>During the reigns of Vladislav and his son Louis, the power of
the Estates grew, however, royal power diminished. Various
conflicts also took place: a conflict between royal towns and
nobles, and religious struggles between the Hussite Church and
the minority Catholic Church which aimed to regain its former
power. </p>

<h5><a name="c7">The Habsburg Dynasty</a> (1526-1918) </h5>

<p>The Habsburgs of Austria succeeded to the throne of Bohemia
when the Jagellon line died out. <b>The Habsburg rule brought the
re-introduction of the Roman Catholic faith, centralization and
the construction of a multi-national empire. The Habsburgs
included the Crownlands of Bohemia in their monarchy, and they
remained a part of the Habsburg empire until 1918.</b> </p>

<p>When Rudolf II (1576-1611), during his reign, left Vienna for
Prague, Bohemian capital grew into an important center of
European culture. The Czech Estates forced Rudolf II to issue a
decree - so called &quot;Maiestatus&quot; - proclaiming freedom
of religious confession. The Emperors Matthias and Ferdinand
tried to limit this freedom and their efforts sparked a civil war
between the Estates and the Catholic Emperor. The Estates were
defeated in 1620 at the Battle of the White Mountain. The
following period of the Thirty Years' War brought political
disorder and economic devastation to Bohemia which had
far-reaching consequences on the future development of the
country. The people of Bohemia were forced to accept the Catholic
faith or to emigrate. The throne of Bohemia was made hereditary
in the Habsburg dynasty and the most important offices were
transferred permanently to Vienna. </p>

<p>In the period after the end of the Thirty Years' War high
Baroque culture became deeply rooted in Bohemia. Czech Baroque
influenced the architecture of Czech towns and villages for
several centuries. </p>

<p>A crisis of feudalism and the fiscal interests of the state
led to the Enlightment reforms of Maria Theresa and Joseph II in
the second half of the 18th century. The reforms brought some
positive results as Bohemia and the margravate of Moravia each
became an independent part of the Habsburg Monarchy. There were
some negative results however. The reforms contributed to the
centralization of power and to Germanization, which proved to be
a serious threat to the identity of the Slavic nationalities of
the empire. </p>

<h5><a name="c8">Foundation of the Modern Czech Nation</a> </h5>

<p>Although the Czech national revival movement aspired at first
only to a revival of the Czech language and culture, it soon
began to strive for political emancipation. In the revolutionary
year 1848, Czech politicians made the first coherent political
propositions aimed at rebuilding the empire into a federalist
state. <b>A desire for national emancipation was supported by the
quick industrialization of Bohemia, which made the country the
most developed land of the monarchy in the second half of the
19th century.</b> </p>

<h5><a name="c9">Independent State </a>(from 1918) </h5>

<p>In the years during World War I Czech politics took a turn
towards radicalism as a result of the activities abroad of T. G.
Masaryk and E. Benes, the future presidents. The defeat of the
Austria-Hungary cleared the way for the foundation of an
independent state of Czechs and Slovaks (28.10.1918). <b>The
Czechoslovak Republic became one of the ten most developed
countries of the world. </b>A period of twenty years of democracy
and prosperity was ended by the aggression of Hitler's Germany.
The conference in Munich and the following German occupation in
March 1939 brought the end of the independent Czech state. </p>

<p>After World War II, the restored republic became part of the
Soviet sphere of power. A period of &quot;limited&quot; democracy
was ended by a <b>Communist takeover in February 1948</b>. All
private property was expropriated and political and human rights
were supressed. An attempt to change and humanize Communist
totality and to weaken ties to the Soviet Union failed when the
Soviet Army invaded the country in August 1968. </p>

<p>The gradual decay of the Communist regime and the Soviet
empire, and the mass protests and demonstrations of the
Czechoslovak people culminated in the <b>overthrow of the
Communist regime in November 1989</b>. The changes were confirmed
by the election of Vaclav Havel as president of the republic. </p>

<p><b>On January 1, 1993, the Czechoslovak state was peacefully
divided and the independent Czech and Slovak Republics were
founded. </b>The Czechs are now completing the transformation of
the formerly centralized state system into a parliamentary
democracy and market economy. </p>
