<p>The Czech Republic is situated approximately in the
geographical centre of Europe and has an area of 78,866 sq. km.
It is a landlocked country 326 km from the Baltic and 322 km from
the Adriatic. It shares borders with Germany (810 km), Poland
(762 km), Austria (466 km) and Slovakia (265 km). The highest
point of elevation is the peak of Mt. Snezka (1,602 m above sea
level) and the lowest point of elevation is near Hoensko where
the River Labe leaves Czech territory (117 m above sea level). </p>

<b>TOPOGRAPHY</b> <br>
<a href="http://www.cesnet.cz/pub/czech-republic/cz-map.gif">Map
of the Czech Republic</a> </p>

<p>The divide between the two principal mountain systems in
Europe - the Hercynian and Alpine-Himalayan - runs through Czech
territory. The country's topography is therefore quite varied:
plains (4.5% of the country), hills (50.1%) highlands (33.9%) and
mountains (11,6%). Altitude levels: lowland regions under 200 m
above sea level make up 4.95% of the country, regions 200 - 500 m
above sea level make up 74.1%, regions 600 - 1,000m above sea
level 19.3% and regions over 1,000 m above sea level 1.6%. </p>

<p><b>Principal Mountain Ranges:</b> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.trutnov.vol.cz/krkonose/index.html"><b>Krkono&#154;e
(Giant Mountains</b><font size="2"><b>)</b></font></a> <br>
The Krkono&#154;e range stretches 40km into Bohemian territory,
creating a natural border between the Czech Republic and Poland,
and is the Czech Republic´s highest mountain range. The highest
peak is Mt. Snezka (1,602 m). Several other peaks exceed 1,500 m.
In order to preserve both wildlife and the environment, the
Krkono&#154;e was proclaimed a national park in 1963. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.oku-je.cz/"><b>Hrubý Jeseník (Ash
Mountains)</b></a> <br>
The Hrubý Jeseník is the second highest mountain range in the
Czech Republic, and its highest point is Praded Peak (1,491 m).
Located in northern Moravia, this range is similar in character
to the Krkono&#154;e and has been a protected region since 1969. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.retour.cz/index.htm"><b>&#138;umava
(Bohemian Forest)</b></a> <br>
The third highest mountain range in the Czech Republic, the
&#138;umava´s highest point is Plechý Peak (1,373 m). The
&#138;umava extends 125 km into south-western Bohemia from the
border and creates a natural boundary with Germany. Five
limestone lakes found here are of glacial origin. The Black Lake
is the largest (18.61 hectares). The &#138;umava has been a
protected region since 1962 and was declared a national park in
1991. This region is also protected on the German side where it
becomes The Bavarian Forest National Park. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cesnet.cz/pub/czech-republic/cz-map.gif"><b>LAKES
AND RIVERS</b></a> </p>

<p>The Czech Republic is called the roof of Europe since its only
source of water is atmospheric rain and snowfall. All the rivers
which have their source in the area drain into neighbouring
countries. <br>
<b>The Czech Republic has three river basins:</b> <br>
The Labe (Elbe) River Basin (drains into the North Sea) - 51,399
sq.km. Main rivers: Labe, Vltava <br>
The Odra (Oder) River Basin (drains into the Baltic) - 4,721
sq.km. Main rivers: Odra, Opava, Ostravice and Ol&#154;e <br>
The Dunaj (Danube) River Basin (drains into the Black Sea) -
22,744 sq. km. Main rivers: Morava, Dyje <br>
The river basins intersect at Kralický Sni3ník on the Polish
border. </p>

<p><b>Lakes and ponds</b> <br>
There are 455 natural lakes in the Czech Republic, 350 of which
are river lakes that have formed in the grasslands of larger
rivers. A characteristic feature of the Czech landscape is the
large number of artificial lakes created for fish-farming. They
number 21,800 in total and cover about 41,000 hectares. The
largest of them are Lake Rozmberk and Lake Bezdrev in southern
Bohemia. </p>

<p><a href="http://194.108.160.102/cztg/spc1.htm"><b>Mineral
Waters</b></a> <br>
The abundance and quality of mineral springs in the Czech
Republic makes the country a world leader in this area. Many
large and renowned spas have been founded around natural or
drilled mineral water springs, including the spa in Karlovy Vary,
as well as in Mariánské Lázne, Franti&#154;kovy Lázne,
Podebrady, Luhacovice, Jáchymov, and many others which are
smaller but still therapeutically important. The warmest Czech
springs include the famous Thermal Spring in Karlovy Vary (72oC),
and springs in Teplice (42oC) and Janské Lázni (29.6oC). The
waters from former uranium mines in Jáchymov have the highest
radioactivity in the world (5,085 Mach units, .08 oz.Rn/gal.) </p>

<p>CLIMATE </p>

<p>The Czech Republic lies in the temperate climate zone of
Europe, which makes for pleasantly mild summers and winters with
only moderate amounts of precipitation. <br>
Lowland temperatures in July average 20oC, {Prague 19.5oC} and in
mountainous areas 8-11oC. <br>
Lowland temperatures in January average -1 to -2oC, -5 to -7oC in
the mountains. </p>

<p>POPULATION </p>

<p>According to a 1997 census, the Czech Republic has a
population of 10.3 million people, 5 million males and 5.3
million females. Three quarters of the population live in urban
areas. <br>
The population density is 131 inhabitants per sq. km, while the
total growth in population in the Czech Republic is 0.8 persons
per 1,000 inhabitants. </p>

<p><b>Population Growth</b> <br>
Until 1994, an outstanding feature of the Czech Republic was its
stable population growth, with the exception of the period of the
two world wars. Since 1994, however, the population has been
decreasing and is expected to have fallen to around 10 million by
2020. </p>

<p><b>Birth rate</b> <br>
After WW II, the number of births fell from over 200,000 a year
to less than 150,000 in 1970. In 1974 this figure had increased
to 195,000 but by 1996 had fallen gradually to 90,000. The number
of new-born babies per 1,000 inhabitants was 8.8 % in 1996. </p>

<p><b>Death rate</b> <br>
The number of deaths per 1,000 inhabitants gradually increased
from World War II until 1983 (13.0%). Since then it has decreased
and in 1996 it was only 10.9 %, thus corresponding to western
European levels. </p>

<b>Ethnic Groups</b> <br>
The majority of the Czech Republic&#146;s inhabitants are of
Czech nationality. The situation in individual regions differs
however, according to whether these regions are considered Czech
or Moravian. The only region where a large number of people claim
Moravian nationality is in southern areas of Moravia. <br>

<p>The long-term development of the population's ethnic structure
indicates that between 1950 and 1991 no significant changes
occurred, except for a relatively high number of Romany
new-arrivals from Slovakia. Although just 33,000 people declared
themselves as Romany in the 1991 census, there are estimated to
be approximately 200,000 Romanies in the Czech Republic, i.e.
nearly 2% of the population. Many said they were Czech, but most
described themselves as Slovak. </p>

<p><b>Religion</b> <br>
After forty years of official suppression, a question concerning
religious faith was again included in the most recent census. The
results show that more than 50% of the population describe
themselves as atheist; in Northern Bohemia this group makes up
some three quarters of the population. </p>

<p><b>Education</b> <br>
The degree of education completion at elementary, secondary and
university levels is very high in the Czech Republic compared to
world standards. All children in the Czech Republic must attend
elementary school up to the age of 15. Upon finishing elementary
school, 52% of children continue their education in vocational
schools and 48% move on to secondary schools. 7.2% of Czechs
complete a university education. </p>

<p>Over the period 1980-1991, there was an increase in the number
of people completing each level of education. The proportion of
people who only completed primary education dropped sharply
(index 76.8%), while the number of people with higher education
grew. The highest increase could be observed for university
education (index 148.1%), and for postgraduate education (index
139.0%). </p>

<p>According to the population census in 1991, 33% of the
population over 15 years of age had received a basic education,
while 30% had finished secondary professional education, 28% had
finished secondary universal or professional education and 7.2%
had finished university education with a minimum of four
years&#146; study. 1.8% of the population did not state any
education in the census or said they had not received any
education. </p>

<p>Between 1991 and 1996, 93,531 persons finished university
education, i.e. an average of under 19,000 persons per year. In
1997, 23.9 % of the population over 15 years of age had received
a primary (elementary) education, 34.1% had finished secondary
professional education, 29.2 % had graduated from secondary
universal or professional schools and 7.8% of the population over
15 had completed university. 1.8% of the population over 15 had
not received any education. </p>

<p><b>Employment</b> <br>
Central planning biased the structure of employment by placing a
grossly disproportionate emphasis on industry, to the detriment
of the service sector. Economic transformation is correcting this
imbalance, however, with employment rising in services and
declining in industry. In 1989 a relatively small percentage of
the population worked in agriculture and the number is still
dropping. </p>

<p><b>Unemployment</b> <br>
The Czech Republic has a lower unemployment rate than any other
country in the former Eastern bloc. The number of job applicants
increased in 1991, gradually decreased in 1992, but slightly
increased again in 1993. The unemployment rate was 3.19% as of
December 31, 1994, a slight decrease compared to the rate for the
period ending December 31, 1991 (4.13%). </p>

<p>According to data from the 30th of August of 1995,
unemployment fell to 2.96%, continuing to fall until the middle
of 1996, when it began rising again. By the end of 1997 it had
reached 5%. </p>
