<center><big><h1><b>DOMINATED! </big></h1></b> <center><b>HOHOHO SCREW YOU ROUND EYE! <center> Uh oh Mr. Admin looks
like your server got hackerized! 0h well, you're lucky im a good little hacker and backed up your index.html, so you
can thank me with those mouth muscles later *wink*. <center><b>Look at it this way, we broke into your house, wrote
all over your walls with crayon, but at least we didn't steal or break anything :). That's some fucked up logic right
there sonny jim! <center>And Now reguarding the current state of defacing... <center>It is fucking over run by kids
who can only run ./unicode ./msadc2 and hacker the planet, or that portion running insecure nt servers. <center>We
here at hackweiser were reading some top secret .gov hacker files and we found some thing interesting in paragraph 9
setion 2 of the pink books, it reads... <center><h1><b>"THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED THAT ALL WINDOWS NT DEFACERS ARE
NOT HACKERS IN THE LEAST AND ARE SUBJECT TO 2 WEEKS OF ANAL SEX WITH REDNECKS AND GRIZZLEY BEARS IN THE WOODS WHILE
WEARING A PINK COWBOY HAT AND A 10 Lb. WEIGHT ON THERE FALICES!" <center>We read it, honest, and just incase you kids
are too stupid and brainwashed from the media a falice is a dinky dink. <center>I am tired of people walking around
looking the same everywhere you go, all bleach blonde hair and no matter how fat they'll be decked out in the latest
fashions from MtV. <center>That shows no originality and everyone following the media as a means of thought should be
shot in the anus with a cannon. <center><b>hackweiser signin' off after another bout of domination! <center>Evil
Angelica i noticed you call yourself the hacking whore, well goto defcon and we can see how big of a whore you really
are :). p.s. you are one funny girl! We love you...the kind of way an uncle loves you and tells you "now don't tell
mommy, we'll keep this our little secret *wink*".
