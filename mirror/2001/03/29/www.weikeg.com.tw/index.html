0wNeD by hackweiser and Warlord, you got owned, how does that
feel? Don't worry admin, your probably having some sort of neo-orgasm
or something, heh I did not delete anything, I renamed your original index to index2.html because I am
not malicious. Evil

you can last. (y'all know what I mean, heheh).</center>

this kid ladies and gentlemen, he's a 20 year old skript kiddie named Jon
Savage who goes around wu'ing the world and somehow thinks he's "l33t" by
doing so. He lives in the UK in a place called Whales, he's a college dropout,
and he still lives with his parents. Does this look like a bright person to
you? YOU DECIDE, ladies and gentlemen. It's Funny as hell, he should be a
comedian he's so pathetic.<p>Anyways, your box is not secure, I suggest you
fix it immediately, and that kernel version of yours is too old, it's also
locally vulnerable, you might wanna upgrade it, or better yet come on down
to the FreeBSD side, my favorite distro.<br><center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email me
