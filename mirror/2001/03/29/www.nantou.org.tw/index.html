<b>Dominated! <br><br>
We'll it looks like you buncha' dorks got your asses hackerized by
hackweiser & Warlord! <center><b>Welp Mr. K rad admin man, we aren't the type
of naughty lil' hackers to erase files and steal anything from your silly
lil' comp...but one of the kids that finds my little rootshell
might have a slightly different agenda ]:) ! <br><br>And what's up with all the
./wu kiddies who go around wu'ing the world and acting malicious, rooting,
defacing, and basically FUCKING UP servers from poor countries? Have you no
remorse? Have you no pity? It's kiddies like you who give the rest of us a bad
name. <b>Hackweiser was looking at all the current defacements and we
have seen that the "scene", if it still exists, has fallen into the hands of an
exorbitant amount of people who worship rfp and whoever the guy who found out
the first couple unicode bugs were...we hate you guy that found those bugs!
Around 90% of all of the defacements on mirrors now are just gay "echo
-h4ck3r3d3d b1 sum1 3fr337! >C:\inetpub\wwwwroot\buttfuck.html".  We
got some bad news kidd-0's..no matter how much you can defend yourself..
<h1>./UNICODE IS NOT HACKING, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS!! It's
picking on the weakest server on the market right now and then jerking off
with all your other windows friends and saying "god damn we can echo! maybe
some security firm will pick us up after seeing our cool windows defacements
gee golly gosh!". <b>Well kids sorry to break it to you but it just
won't happen like that. But you windows defacers do have a promising field in
security...say mall security, hall monitor, or the guy who walks around porn
theaters with a flash light and tries to catch of glimpse of an over-zealous
moron pounding the snot out of his "mr.peenie weenie". Learn some skill
ya buncha' retards! <br>Dominated by Hackweiser in y2k+1 muva' fuhkuz!
<br> Evil angelica, we love you, can we give you a donkey punch? Hey,
maybe you can get naked for us at defcon and we'll touch you like your uncle
always wanted to! </center>Hackweiser hearts Evil Angelica </H1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuck you'z to: gideon[zs] <-- ROFL, look at this kid ladies and
gentlemen, he's a 20 year old skript kiddie named Jon Savage who goes
around wu'ing the world and somehow thinks he's "l33t" by doing so. Does it feel cool to live with your
parents at the age of 20, huh jon? Does it feel cool when people make fun of you all the time cause you
ain't got shit? Your funny as hell, you should be a comedian your so pathetic.
