In 1925 a German immigrant, William H. Walter came to the United States and as many new citizens of that era, he set out to make his mark in a free world that the United States had to offer.  After developing and manufacturing an artificial marble known as Marbletex , he moved his operation from Chicago, Illinois to Lima, Ohio where it flourished.
<p>
As with many businesses,  his business fell on hard times during the depression, but Mr. Walter's entrapenueral spirit would not be daunted.  He had an idea which led to the development of a new process for the remedial treatment and waterproofing of masonry buildings.  This process was almost immediately accepted, and in 1936 the Trisco Waterproofing Company was formed.  The Trisco System , which this new process was called, was applied for and received patents, and by 1945 was a recognized standard for the treatment of school buildings in the State of Ohio.  The company grew in the 40's and 50's with offices in six major cities in three states and in 1956 was incorporated as Trisco System, Inc.
<p>
After a decade of hard times the Company was reorganized which served to be the beginning of a long and continued growth and development process.  Trisco expanded its work force and capabilities including the development and manufacturing of many of its own products.  It was the first company of its type to utilize chemicals to clean buildings in the midwest.
<p>
With the national recognition and demand for revitalizing older historic structures, building restoration truly became an industry in the 70's and 80's and Trisco was poised to become an active participant.  The Company expanded its capabilities and as the industry grew so did Trisco.
<p>
In the 80's and 90's the company experienced a rapid but controlled growth,  This growth was not only in the number of employees but in the ever increasing type of work that the company became proficient in performing.  The company was again reorganized as Trisco Systems, Inc. to meet the demands of the market, the demands of technology and the ever changing demands of modern day business.
<p>
Today, the Trisco family of businesses employs over 125 people and has expanded into all facets of exterior building and structure restoration, renovation and retrofit.  Trisco is recognized as an industry leader in the fields of masonry and concrete restoration, terra cotta restoration, exterior insulation finish system (EIFS) rehabilitation, sealant and specialized coating applications, waterproofing systems and structural building retrofitting. All of these capabilities are currently  offered throughout the midwest and eastern half of the United States.  With its many years of experience and knowledge Trisco also offers professional consulting and evaluation services.
<p>
Today the Company continues to grow and flourish still under the direction of the Walter family.  It is the commitment  to the industry and the eagerness to succeed that was demonstrated in the first generation that still drives Trisco Systems today.
