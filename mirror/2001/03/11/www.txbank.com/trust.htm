<BR>Living Trusts can be established to manage your assets, pay your bills,

deposit income to your personal checking account, keep your tax records,

pay your employees, plus many other work saving services.

<P>&nbsp;Testamentary Trusts allow the bank to administer your assets after

your death and for the benefit of your family in much the same way you

would. These trusts can be used to manage a large asset (such as a farm

or ranch) with multiple heirs on behalf of the family members who would

otherwise inheret the property. These trusts allow you to benefit your

spouse for his/her lifetime and then turn the remaining assets over to

another party, such as children or charity.

<P><A NAME="finance"></A><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Financial Services</FONT></I></B>

<BR>The Trust Department at Texas State Bank also provides investment services.

Our ability to combine cash from several different trusts allows us to

purchase $100,000 Certificates of Deposit to get better rates. We can buy

large blocks of common stocks and government bonds to get broker discounts.

Plus our record keeping services greatly simplify year end tax reporting

on your investments. We can independently manage your investments or you

can make direct purchases and sales.

<BR>The Trust Department at Texas State Bank can oversee the operation

of farm and ranch property as well as oil and gas production. We also manage

residential rental properties and business properties.

<BR>The Trust Department at Texas State Bank offers I.R.S. approved retirement

plan documents for use by employers. Profit Sharing 401(K) Plans and Money

Purchase Pension Plans are offered to provide you and your employees the

maximum potential advantages. As Trustee of your company's retirement plan,

we maintain possession of the funds, make investments, keep investment

records, and assist you in determining each employee's account balance.

Employee and government reporting, such as Forms 1099-R and 5500 C/R, are

coordinated with the company accountant to meet all necessary deadlines.

<P>&nbsp;<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Individual Retirement Accounts</FONT></I></B>

<BR>If you want your I.R.A. to invest in more than local Certificates of

Deposit, the Trust Department at Texas State Bank can set up a "Self Directed"

I.R.A. to invest in virtually anything you want which is allowed by law.

For example, we subscribe to a national computer network which allows us

to shop C.D. rates throughout the country and to generally find fully insured

C.D. rates much higher than in the local market. Our very reasonable fee

is almost always covered by improved earnings.

<P>&nbsp;<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Simplified Employee Pensions</FONT></I></B>

<BR>Like company sponsored plans, S.E.P.s cover eligible employees as well

as the owner of the business. The Trust Department can set up I.R.A. accounts

for each employee who receives a contribution from your S.E.P. and allow

each employee to direct his/her own investments and receive his/her own

trust reports.
