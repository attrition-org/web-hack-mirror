<b><i><font size=+3>History

<hr noshade size=1><img src="Images/star.gif"  align=TOP width="16" height="13"></font></i></b> Texas

Bank opened its doors on February 16, 1963 at 2201 Sherwood Way with nine

employees, 108 stockholders, and $500,000 in exchange assets and cash.

<p><img src="Images/star.gif"  align=TOP width="16" height="13"> The original founders of Texas Bank

believed that a homeowned bank could better serve West Texans in realizing

their visions for a prosperous future. The Bank was a valuable resource

during its early years, providing capital, services, and leadership to

the West Texas area.

<p><img src="Images/star.gif"  align=TOP width="16" height="13"> Assets increased six-fold during the

Bank's first decade of service. Additions to the Bank since it opened have

included a motorbank, and a four story 30,000 foot tower opened in 1979.

In 1997 plans were announced for a new branch site located in the southwest

part of the city.

leadership</a> has always governed Texas Bank as a stable, secure financial

source. Through the years capitalization has remained consistently strong.

This kind of conservative management really paid off in the 80's as the

booming oil industry experienced setbacks. The stability of Texas Bank

was sustained.

<p><img src="Images/star.gif"  align=TOP width="16" height="13"> Texas Bank has invested extensively

in computer technology to provide customers with the latest in state-of-the-art

banking services and products. The Bank has been the leader in introducing

new technologies including Anytime Banking--24 hour telephone access introduced

in 1994, Check Imaging Processing introduced in 1996, a local home page

on the World Wide Web, and Internet Banking Bill pay in 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><img src="Images/star.gif"  align=TOP width="16" height="13"> In 1996 Texas Bank became San Angelo's

<i>only</i>

 home-owned bank. Texas Bank is well positioned now and for the future to

compete with any regional or national bank.

early 1999.
