Hacked, cracked, and double-smacked! You have been 0wned by IP-Master! Now let me ask you a question. Are YOU going to trust a company that sells security software when they can't even secure their own web servers from hackers? I THINK NOT! How pitiful it is that a SECURITY COMPANY gets hacked. You need to fire your server administrator. He clearly knows nothing. And in case your boss is reading this Mister Admin, the patch for this exploit has been available for MORE that SEVEN MONTHS. Now THAT is pathetic. Now that I am finished publicly degrading you, have a nice day. And remember p4ntera lubs j00!
