in and out, like poppin a prom queens cherry and gettin
out before her parents come home with only a stank used 
condom as the evidence. anyways, logs were handled as i
am sure you can figure. how you guys got this far with-
out getting tagged i'll keep guessing at, but really, 
nt is shit...
mmkay? anway for help - install recent service packs, a
little user auditing wouldnt hurt. (passwords, rights,
ACL's etc) and check your running services. or just get
a better operating system. it would be the best way to 
go, anyway if ya got questions flames, etc, email me at 
mr_o@disinfo.net, peace im outtie.....

well allhahahallrrrighty then... a little poetic justice for ownme.com? me thinkums yes!
really though folks, it is a ponejammeh, its a metaphor for the current standards of a still so infantile expansion of modern communication. got a .com? .*? well, chances are you've been made <i>victim</i> at some time or another too... but correct me if i'm wrong but, doesnt it seem odd people put so much into so little? say i tag your site, what have you really lossed? did it have sentimental value? could you hold it in your hands and use it for realistic benefit? hmmm, maybe. but what i'm sayin is go with the motions, remember that all this is just a collection of electric pulses along with some duct tape and bailing wire with a few nuts and bolts in between. go outside and chill, go to a movie, go have a drink with your friends. its not the end of the world, its not like you can really say this can't happen because not even the people who started it can tell if anything is secure, so whats that tell you? anyway i dunno, a little incoherent ramble for your personal enjoyment. dont mix the skizmflop wit my lapadoo cuz that ain't my ponejammeh...
