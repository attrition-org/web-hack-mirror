    <p align="left">F-911 is a new concept in fastening systems. A program of strength and
    reliability, with full accountability.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>F-911 IS TOUGH</strong>.<br>
    In an industry of deteriorating standards, the F-911 fastener restores<img src="images/Bolts.jpg" alt="Bolts.jpg (7434 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="265"> confidence to fastener
    users by setting a new, higher level of strength. With a minimum 180,000 PSI, F-911 is 20%
    stronger than the best Grade 8 cap screw. Test results show that F-911 continually&nbsp;
    exceeds minimum torque requirements and stands up to severe stress. That's because F-911
    fasteners are meticulously engineered and manufactured only from the highest grade
    domestic alloy steels.</p>
    <p align="left">And F-911 can take the heat. <big><br>
    </big>To harden steel, it must undergo heat treating. But heat treating alone doesn't
    guarantee performance. That's because in the process a fastener can lose much of its
    pliability or &quot;ductility,&quot; actually making it brittle. <big><br>
    </big>Not so with F-911<big><br>
    </big>We utilize only the most modern metallurgical equipment and techniques. The result:
    A superior grade fastener of incredibly high tensile strength.</p>

    F-911 SAVES YOU MONEY. IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.</strong><p>Surely a fastener with such high
    standards must have a high price!<big><br>
    </big>Not so. <big><br>
    </big>F-911 is so widely used, that you'll find prices to be competitive with domestic
    Grade 8. In fact, many smart manufacturers have found that because of F-911's increased
    strength, they can specify fewer, smaller fasteners to get the job done. This can
    significantly reduce the package size and the overall weight of the end product, saving
    the additional shipping costs and assembly time required in Grade 8 or smaller
    applications.</p>
    <p>And extra strength means reduced fastener failure. And an increased margin of safety
    and reliability. So you save on downtime and costly repairs.</p>
    <p>And what about wear?<big><br>
    </big>A fastener that wears poorly must be replaced more often. With F-911's superior
    strength and extra head height, you'll&nbsp; save on maintenance costs.</td>

    You'll&nbsp; get solid, positive action when wrenching to the desired torque. This is what
    we mean by &quot;wrenchability.&quot;&nbsp; And if you have equipment that is subject to
    wear and abrasion, you'll appreciate that extra margin of metal at the head!</td>
