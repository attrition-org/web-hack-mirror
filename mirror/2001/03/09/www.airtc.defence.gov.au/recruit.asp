<A NAME="RECRUIT"><H2>What is the Air Training Corps?</H2>



The Air Force runs the Air Training Corps and, if you are a boy or girl aged between

 12.5 and 18, you can join and stay on as a cadet until you are 20.



Here is your chance to learn a lot about aircraft and flying. Many air cadets go on to

 join the Air Force or find a valuable, exciting career in civilian aviation.



The Air Training Corps will help you develop and could make getting a job easier for,

 no matter what you decide to do with your life. You will learn to lead others and be

 promoted within the Air Training Corps.  You will be able to do things for yourself

 and help your friends learn, too.



There is a Squadron in every state and in each Squadron there are local Flights which

 usually meet one evening a week during school terms.  Flight activities are supervised

 by instructors, officers as well as senior cadets.



So join now and we can help you reach for the sky.



<H2>Planeloads of Fun, Action and Adventure.</H2>



Of course, you learn a lot about aircraft and aviation, but there are a lot of other

 subjects too which we call electives. Sporting activities such as basketball, canoeing,

 orienteering as well as parachuting. Yes, some cadets even get to jump out of an aircraft!



Learn communication skills, how to navigate and survive in the bush, read maps and fire a

 rifle. Go to a camp at a RAAF Base during the school holidays...it's just like the real

 thing!



You can compete with other Flights to win annual trophies. You could try your hand at air

 traffic control. Plus, you might even be selected for a two or three week exchange program

 to places like Canada, Singapore or the U.S.A. in our International Air Cadet Exchange.



Like anything else, you'll start at the bottom as a cadet but there are plenty of chances

 for promotion and well teach you the skills you need to command other young cadets.



<H2>Spread Your Wings and Fly.</H2>



As a cadet, you will get the opportunity to fly as a passenger in Air Force aircraft during

 camps and visits to RAAF Bases. You can glide solo from as young as 15 and, before you know

 it, you could have that great Cadet Solo Flying Badge on your uniform.



One cadet said, "Gliding is an experience I would recommend to anyone who wishes to fly. It's

 fantastic. I felt safe, in control, and wished it went on longer. And the gliding camps are

 the greatest!"



If you are 16 and over, then powered flying may be for you. It is terrific fun, and when you

 fly a light aircraft solo your friends will really be envious. Once you get your Cadet Solo

 Flying Badge, you are on your way to a Private Pilot's Licence. And you thought learning to

 drive a car was the ultimate!



Gliding and powered flying training is available in most areas at reduced costs to cadets,

 and there are some flying scholarships. So the Air Training Corps could really have you up,

 up and away.



<H2>Today's Cadets are Tomorrow's Leaders.</H2>



Many Air Force officers and top people in civilian aviation started with the Air Training

 Corps. No matter what career you choose, what you have learn't in the Air Training Corps

 is going to help you get there.



You will learn to be confident, self sufficient and willing to 'have a go'. You will be able

 to take the initiative and show others how it's done. These are the things that will give

 you the edge.



The Air Training Corps can teach you these important skills to see you right through your

 life. You will be a leader, but you will also be part of a team. You will be independent,

 yet you will be able to take charge of situations. You will really enjoy the feeling of

 achieving what you set out to do.



<H2>Reaching For The Sky.</H2>



If you would like to join the Air Training Corps, you must be aged between 13 and 17, be

 an Australian citizen or a permanent resident, and be physically fit enough to take on

 activities such as marching, bushwalking and flying as a passenger.



Your uniform is free of charge, and so is basic training.  Most Flights have parent

 support groups to help raise funds, however you may need to pay a small contribution

 each term.



Being in the Air Training Corps needn't clash with your school work. It could even help.

 Also we know when exams are happening and we understand that they can make life a bit

 hard for you. So we know when to take it easy and when to challenge you.



So how about getting your Air Training Corps 'clearance' from your parents and taking

 off on an exciting new adventure, not just for the next couple of years but for the

 rest of your life.



To join, ask any Air Training Corps cadet to take you along to their Flight or simply

 go along yourself and ask to speak to the Flight Recruiting Officer. As well, be sure

 to ask to see the video about the Air Training Corps. You'll be very impressed!



For the address of your nearest Air Training Corps Flight, go to the Air Training Corps

 Home Page and locate the Squadron for your state. Each Squadron has provided a listing

 of all of their local Flights and their respective contact numbers.
