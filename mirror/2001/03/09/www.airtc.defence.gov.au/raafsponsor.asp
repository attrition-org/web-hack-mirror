<H1>Royal Australian Air Force Sponsorship</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

The AIRTC is essentially a community based youth organisation

which is primarily sponsored by the RAAF.    AIRTC policy and

higher level administration is handled by the Directorate of Reserves

- Air Force at Russell Offices in Canberra.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

AIRTC units receive the following direct support from the RAAF:

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>ACCOMMODATION AND RATIONS</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

When AIRTC cadets and staff are participating in a camp or course

at a RAAF Base, they are provided with free accommodation and

three meals a day.   When on camp, cadets will experience a similar

lifestyle to permanent Air Force personnel. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>FACILITIES</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

Most AIRTC Flights have their weekly parade at a building which

is provided by the RAAF.   These buildings may be shared with

Army Reserve units or a school.   Some Flights own their own buildings.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>UNIFORMS</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

the RAAF is committed to providing members of the AIRTC with a

ceremonial and a field uniform.   This uniform is essentially

the same as that worn by the RAAF.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>TRAVEL</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

Each year, the RAAF commits a significant sum of money to help

pay for the transport of cadets from their home towns to RAAF

Bases for camps and courses.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>SERVICE AIRCRAFT</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

When available, RAAF aircraft are used to give AIRTC cadets air

experience and familiarisation flights.   Sometimes, service aircraft

are used to transport cadets interstate to and from camps and

exercises.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>AVIATION FUEL</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

Most AIRTC Squadrons have a flying training program.   To help

keep the aircraft operating costs as low as possible, the RAAF

supplies the AIRTC with free aviation fuel for the aircraft. 

 Flying training is the AIRTC is approximately half that of commercial

schools.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>AMMUNITION</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

On some camps, cadets are taught how to safely handle and fire

a rifle.   When service rifles are used, the RAAF supplies the

ammunition. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>STAFF HONORARIUMS</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

Being an AIRTC instructor can sometimes be a drain on your time

and finances.   To help reduce this impact, the RAAF pays all

AIRTC instructors a modest honorarium.   This amount is fairly

small but increases as you are promoted within the corps.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>IN SUMMARY</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

Compared to other youth organisations, the AIRTC is excellent

value for money.   Cadets from all areas have the opportunity

to engage in a broad range of activities which are partly or fully

subsidised by the RAAF.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>OTHER SPONSORSHIP</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

The RAAF, like any other Government organisation does not have

a bottomless purse and the AIRTC must continue to seek sponsorship

and financial assistance from a broad range of community organisations.

  The AIRTC National and Regional Councils were created for this

purpose.
