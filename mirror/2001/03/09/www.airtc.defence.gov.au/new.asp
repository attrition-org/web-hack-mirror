Status Report on Server Recovery</H3>
Flight and Squadron HQ homepages have been uploaded and are operational, and the creation
 of user accounts has been completed.  Webmasters who wish to update their pages for their respective flight
 should connect to "ftp.airtc.defence.gov.au" on Port 20.<P>
 The Visitors Book is also up and running, however, the Newsgroup Server will be delayed by a couple of days
 as the licence codes don't work on the new server.  The National Online Events Database and Bulletin
 Board Server will be delayed until sometime this weekend or possibly early next week.<P>
 This represents most of the site having been recovered after the failure.  It has been a huge task rebuilding
 the site, mainly due to the fact that the opportunity was taken to upgrade much of the hardware and
 all of the server operating system, and web server software was updated to the latest versions.
<P>
 It would be appreciate from this point onwards, if you find any problems with the site, please send an email
 to the National Co-ordinator Internet, Wing Commander(AIRTC) Richard Northam at <A HREF="mailto:r-northam@adfa.edu.au">r-northam@adfa.edu.au</A>.
 I do expect that there will some things which have been missed or no longer work, hence it's important that this

 specific details of the problem.

Service Disruption Notice</H3>
The Air Training Corps Web Server suffered a main SCSI Hard Drive Controller failure around
 lunch time on Tuesday the 27th of July.  Thankfully the redundant controller and drive array
 has enabled the server to continue operating, although the failure has caused a number
 of subsystems to fail, including the scripting engine which controls such things as the Visitors
 Book. Accordingly, the server will be undergoing a major rebuild over the next 24 to 48 hours.
 During this time the site will be offline, or if it is online, it may shut down without warning
 or notice for an unspecified period of time. Prior to, and during the rebuild, various parts of
 the site may not work correctly.  Please do not email the National Co-ordinator Internet about
 these problems until this notice changes advising that all should be repaired.<P>
The Air Training Corps apologises for any inconvenience this failure may cause.
