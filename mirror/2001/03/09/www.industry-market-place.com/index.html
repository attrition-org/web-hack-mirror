<font size=4>Music... it should be free, no? Why do people buy
albums? Because they've heard the music before and they decided they liked
it so much, they'd buy it.<br><br> Why do I download mp3s? To be an
illegal shiz nit.. heh, naw, I download mp3s and if I like 'em, I buy duh
album =)<br><br>I baught the Dre album, eminem's 2 latest albums, Limp
Bizkit, Offspring (3 of 'em!), Bomfunk MCs... etc. But if I didn't have
them on mp3, i doubt I would have got 'em at all... Napster, thank
you.<br><br>So why should Napster be saved? Because it's elite, and shit
heads like Metallica think they're losing money on it.. heh, I bet they
really are suffering in their mansions, with an income of $5000 a day from
sitting on their candy ass'...<br><br>I urge you to <a
