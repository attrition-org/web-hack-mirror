This is so dissapointing.
</h2> 
<p> 
I leave the internet behind for 3 or 4 days to go on a climbing trip - and when I get back theres almost nothing on the defacement archives except windows. A lot of redefacements at that.

<p> 
GET A FUCKING CLUE.

If you skilless monkeys would start reading articles and facts about NT hacks youde realize you are part of a pathetic new generation of defacers that has absolutely no hacking skill at all. IM not saying im some security GENIOUS - but at least I can do most all operating systems.
<p> 
<p> 
Theres a few groups out there that do actually have a variety of skills that Ide like to thank for keeping the defacement archives interesting - Hackweiser .. my boys - Quit Crew - prime suspects - also JMB and Evil Angelica.
