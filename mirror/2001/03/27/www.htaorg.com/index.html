<P>"I only replaced index.html"</P>

<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It would appear that the k-r4d kiddies who deface web pages have
no concept of WHY their </P>

<P>shenanigans illicit such a violent response from the companies
they attack. This brief </P>

<P>article will list some of the behind the scenes events that occur
after the "harmless" </P>

<P>replacement of index.html by our oh-so-favorite political
activists. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1. The company is notified, usually by a customer, that their web
page has been changed. </P>

<P>The server admin, Web Master, or whomever is responsible for the
content is usually the </P>

<P>first person to be told of this event as the company probably
doesn't have an incident </P>

<P>response plan. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2. The admin shits a brick and tells his manager. The
administrator, now in fear for his </P>

<P>job, has to bite the bullet and tell his manager that the company
has been "hacked". He's </P>

<P>probably afraid that the attacker got in through his weak
password, or one of the boxes he </P>

<P>know he should have upgraded six months ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3. Upon hearing this, the manager shits a brick. The midlevel
manager now fears for HIS </P>

<P>job knowing that the brunt of upper management's wrath will fall
on his shoulders for not </P>

<P>securing the systems. The manager tries desperately to figure out
whom to tell in upper </P>

<P>management that will not fire him on the spot. He calls his
manager (usually a VP type) and </P>

<P>tells her the news.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4. Upon hearing this, she freaks out and shits a brick. The VP
calls Human Resources, </P>

<P>Legal, Security (if it exists), and the Director of Engineering or
some other high-level </P>

<P>geek type. The group collectively decides if the site should be
taken down or remain up. A </P>

<P>call is also made to the CEO or other chieftain to inform him of
the situation. After a </P>

<P>quick consultation with the in-house counsel, the decision to
contact or not contact law </P>

<P>enforcement is made. Usually, the upper level types are in
knee-jerk mode and want to </P>

<P>aggressively pursue the intruder "no matter what".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5. All this time, the overworked admin has been scouring his
systems looking for traces of </P>

<P>how the attacker got in. Despite the attacker's claims that "he
only replaced index.html" </P>

<P>the admin's manager wants EVERY system checked and any possible
means of entry sealed off. </P>

<P>The admin will now try to perform a comprehensive security audit
in an hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6. The upper level types contact the Marketing department to
figure out how to handle the </P>

<P>impact to the company's image. Never faced with this sort of
problem before, the Director </P>

<P>of Marketing frets and calls all her people in for "a brainstorm"
on how to handle the </P>

<P>situation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>7. The system is probably backed-up, taken down, and replaced with
a newer box or a </P>

<P>significant upgrade (introducing new bugs) is made to the system.
This takes the busy admin </P>

<P>the better part of a day. Normally, this could be accomplished in
a few hours, but with </P>

<P>visibility on the VP and above level, the admin makes sure he does
is perfectly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8. If law enforcement was called-in, they now spend time with the
administrators and lawyers </P>

<P>to figure out if they have a case (probably not, most of the
evidence was accidentally </P>

<P>destroyed by the admin in the first 4 hours after the
incident).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>9. Upper level types now decree that the systems will be secured
and that nothing like this </P>

<P>will ever happen again. It's likely that big name consultants are
brought in at $200+/hour </P>

<P>to assess the business and make recommendations to improve the
site's security. Since the </P>

<P>admin is already busy doing day-to-day tasks, the consulting firm
probably implements their </P>

<P>recommendations (at $200+/hour).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>10. After a few weeks, things return to normal. The company has
new ACLs, a new firewall, </P>

<P>and maybe some new policies. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now, looking at this, one can see the number of personnel involved
and the amount of time </P>

<P>invested in recovering from the "harmless" defacing of index.html.
I haven't even addressed </P>

<P>the additional problems posed when the admin's discover a
trojanized binary or unauthorized </P>

<P>access to source code or other company trade secrets. This is just
the simple stuff.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>"But the attacker said in his 'message' that he backed-up
index.html. All they had to do </P>

<P>was replace it with the original!" No you stupid fool, no. The
attacker has publicly </P>

<P>humiliated a corporation, has shown the world that the site's
security is inadequate, and </P>

<P>has caused significant personal turmoil for 5 or more people.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Furthermore, if I come home one day to find my front door open and
a note attached that </P>

<P>says "Hi. Broke into your place. Only moved your stuff around.
Didn't take anything. Love, </P>

<P>r0bb3r" am I supposed to believe that? Would you? If the company
affected is publicly </P>

<P>traded, they are legally _required_ to investigate and take
measures to ensure that a similar </P>

<P>incident doesn't occur. If they don't, their shareholders can sue
for negligence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now, I can't possibly justify the tens of millions in losses
claimed by companies in cases </P>

<P>like Mitnick or others - that's lunacy. However, reading the
above, I hope it becomes clear </P>

<P>that there is significant time and money spent to clean up these
"simple" attacks. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

to all us evil bastards who don't give a
