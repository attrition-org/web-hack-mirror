Depression runs throughout my soul.<p>
Eyes of straigh coal.<p>
Wondering of my place on this wicked world.<p>
Mabey with a girl, but non of my choice. <p>
For society doesnt respect people who choose the other way.<p>
Not to live another day, to feel betray.<p>
Dead inside, Seem to be the only way to stay alive.<p>
To strive to live life to the fullest extent.<p>
And to bare concent of those who seem to be greater.<p>
And wonder of who the creator of life might be.<p>
Possibly a greater vindicator. Only to see.<p>
For this is a shout for help. As if no one sees me.<p>
Just a mere though running through your brain.<p>
Only if someone could feel my pain.<p>
Experiance 25 seconds of my life. And not break down in trife.<p>
Thoughts of suidside bring me to the next day.<p>
Wondering if its worth it to even pray.<p>
Who am I praying to? Give me some clue.<p>
For now it seems worthless.<p>
Hells depression overwelms my soul.<p>
Falling deeper into the blackhole of no return.<p>
No one to turn too.<p>
No one to tell my problems.<p>
No one to cry on.<p>
Staying up till dawn with a morning yawn.<p>
For sleep is for the weak. I refuse to be beat.<p>
Who really would even care?<p>
No one is there.<p>
Waiting on me, wanting to see me. Wanting to be with me.<p>
Take my last breath.<p>
The smell of death.<p>
But no fear overwelms me.<p>
For I will rest eternaly.<p>
