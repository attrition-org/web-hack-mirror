oldest dispute</font></a></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><font size="2">The Kashmir
dispute is the oldest unresolved international conflict in the world today.
Pakistan considers Kashmir as its core political dispute with India. So does the
international community, except India. While Indian security forces are
practicing an unprecedented reign of terror in Occupied Kashmir being widely
reported world-wide; the Indian government, currently led by Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, is neither willing to negotiate the issue
multilaterally--through international mediation--nor is it ready to sort it out
with Pakistan through bilateral negotiations. India and Pakistan have already
fought two wars over Kashmir. The exchange of fire between their forces across
the Line of Control, which separates Azad Kashmir from Occupied Kashmir, is a
routine affair. Now that both India and Pakistan have acquired nuclear weapons
potential, the possibility of a third war between them over Kashmir, which may
involve the use of nuclear weapons, cannot be ruled out. The likely nuclear
disaster in South Asia, whose cause may be Kashmir, can be averted with an
intervention by the international community. Such an intervention is urgently
required to put an end to Indian atrocities in Occupied Kashmir and prepare the
ground for the implementation of UN resolutions, which call for the holding of a
plebiscite to determine the wishes of the Kashmiri people.&nbsp;</font><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><b>Cause of the
Kashmir dispute</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">India’s forcible occupation of the State
of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 is the main cause of the dispute. <small>India
claims to have 'signed' a controversial document, the Instrument of Accession,
on 26 October 1947 with the Maharaja of Kashmir, in which the Maharaja obtained
India's military help against popular insurgency. The people of Kashmir and
Pakistan do not accept the Indian claim. There are doubts about the very
existence of the Instrument of Accesion. The United Nations also does not
consider Indian claim as legally valid: it recognises Kashmir as a disputed
territory. Except India, the entire world community recognises Kashmir as a
disputed territory. The fact is that all the principles on the basis of which
the Indian subcontinent was partitioned by the British in 1947 justify Kashmir
becoming a part of Pakistan:&nbsp; the State had majority Muslim population, and
it not only enjoyed geographical proximity with Pakistan but also had essential
economic linkages with the territories constituting Pakistan.</small></font></p>
