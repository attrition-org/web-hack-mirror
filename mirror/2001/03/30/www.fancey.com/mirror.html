Slaves 
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh 
Heed 
To his every word, live in fear 
Faith 
Of the unknown one, the deliverer 
Wait 
Something must be done, four hundred years 

So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 

Now 
Let my people go, land of goshen 
Go 
I will be with thee, bush of fire 
Blood 
Running red and strong, down the nil 
Plague 
Darkness three days long, hail to fire 

So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 

Die by my hand 
I creep across the land
Killing first born man 
Die by my hand 
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
