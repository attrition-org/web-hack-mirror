<center>online shopping is flawed.

<br>so is your security.

<br>heh hoh.

<p>hackweiser up in this shit.

<p>a special message to my friend:</center>



<br>&nbsp;

<h4>

you are cool -- P4NTERA.</h4></center>



<center>

<p><br>not me, my friend is cool though.

<br>yey =D</center>



<p><font size=+1>now for some messages:</font>

<p><font size=+1><b>The new "HFD":</b> </font>sorry guys, but i noticed

you think your carrying on HFD's torch. Don't try, im sure the <u>actual</u>

HFD doesn't appreciate the bad crap you are giving them. Defacing no-name

NT sites doesn't get you much anyways. Stop trying to be something you

can never achieve.

<p><b>To all those "freedom hackers" (WFD, Hi-Tech hate etc):</b> Don't

you kids get it? Your not freeing anyone by defacing some no name sites,

your just annoying administrators and hackers everywhere. Even though I

personally don't have a problem with you WFD, you really should stop thinking

you are doing something good for the world. Hey we don't, we know we are

assholes and deserve to be shot (me anyways) but at least we can admit

it. cmon kids, grow up. NOW, TO THE NEW REFORMED HI-TECH HATE. well guys,

i dunno what it is, but old-school name stealing must be the hype nowadays.

I mean, we have that "hacking for dandies" crap, and now we have dumbass

brazilians running around trying to take a name from something they have

no clue about. Do you know what the old hi-tech hate was? Who it was? What

it did? fucking biters, get your own names you dumbfucks. And oh yeah,

come find us we don't fear you either.<b></b>

<p><b>and finally, to my most hated little kids who know less then my left

shoe, BL4F:</b>

<br>I have come to the conclusion that you boys are nothing but hypocrits,

liars and losers. You complain about people hacking different TLD's, yet

you go and deface .au and .de. You complain about people hacking with ./bind,

YET YOU HACK WITH IT. What makes you guys extreme losers is that 2/3's

of your defacements have been RE-DEFACEMENTS. I MEAN CMON FOR CHRISTS SAKE,

HOW LAME CAN YOU BE? You re-defaced our shit, then gforce's, then AmR's,

then ours and then ours some more. WOW GUYS, SUCH SKILL AND ALL. stupid

losers, only xessor re-hacks shit (hahaha). We challenged you to come forth

on a few of our last hacks, yet you fail to show up. Seeing as you have

less skill then my left shoe (which remains un-tied to this very moment),

the challenge remains. FIND US, AND YOU SHALL BE OWNED.&nbsp; KTHX KIDS

=)
