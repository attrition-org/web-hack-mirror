<center><big><h1>DOMINATED!</big></h1> <center><b>Yep another sites bites the dust and another admin bites the pillow!
<center><b>Yep its me again from hackweiser, I have noticed that some people don't like us on the mirrors and we are
very sad and we even cried a couple times about the nasty things you retarded ./cgi hacksers have been saying about us
<center> Especially you retards hacking windows boxes and saying that hackweiser did it...that's just sad kids.
<center><b>Yes hackweiser has defaced windows nt boxes before in the past but the last couple we did with nt have been
defaced with scripts written by members of hackweiser and the exploits are found by members as well...so eat shit!
<center>I am having trouble grasping the concept as to why people would redeface a windows site at all, you kow who
you are and you continue to do it. Cut that shit out it's gets annoying! <center><b>If a server has been defaced
before and you know it's fucking vulnerable then great, I'm really happy that you can attack something you already
know is weak and has been penetrated before. <center>I don't deface NT sites because i find it pointless since
everyone else on the mirrors seems to pick up a copy of unicode.pl or msadc2.pl and hack the planet, but recently i
have coded my own version of the unicode exploit that checks for 24 different strings of the unicode bug and i have
found some very big sites are vulnerable to the unreleased strings. <center><b>I am pondering whether to release this
exploit and let all of the kids use it and create even more problems for system administrators, I seriously doubt i
will release it into the hands of packetstorm or bugtraq, but I will release it to close friends and people i have
respect for. <center>On the other hand all you kids redefacing shit need to cut that out right now! It's not cool and
you get laughed at for redefacing boxes <center><b>If you would like to find your own sites it's incredibly easy with
resources such as mass scanners and sites like www.netcraft.com. <center>I know this site is a .co.kr and i am not
going to act like it is some incredible accomplishment but i am just going to use it to get my voice across to all of
you children out there. <center><h1>Hackweiser in the why two kay plus one squared!</h1>
<center>all you redefacers can eat my doodie with a shovel! Go die you buncha' fucks!
