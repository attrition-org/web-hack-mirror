How come Solaris isnt trendy yet?

Granted, the rpc exploits you can download arent exactly user freindly enough to just compile and start hacking mad solaris - but close enough. With some common sense and a little knowledge - I think solaris is one of the easier operating systems to root. Now im not going to answer all the emails ive been getting about teaching how to hack solaris - and what 0hday do i use - but ill say this. If you would just go to packetstorm and read up on RPC a little, do some experimenting - myself - hackweiser - and a couple other guys wouldnt be hogging all the solaris servers. Intelligent emails are welcome however.
