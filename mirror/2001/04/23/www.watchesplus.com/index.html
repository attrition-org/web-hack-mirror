        <p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="1">Big
        difference here.&nbsp; And remember, it was Israel that
        began the current crisis by having 1000 Israeli troops
        storm the streets of Jerusalem, shooting at everything
        and everyone in their way, on Sept. 29.&nbsp; Now Israel
        has totally closed the West Bank and Gaza, preventing
        food, medical supplies, and other humanitarian
        needs&nbsp; to reach the victims of Israel's inhumanity,
        and making life even more of a nightmare for the
        Palestinian people.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="1">Having
        Israeli soldiers shoot at Palestinian ambulances, fire
        missiles at kids, and enforce economic hardship on the
        Palestinians is not a good way of promoting peace
        m0sad.&nbsp; That only makes the Palestinian people more
        determined to get their freedom from you Israeli
        oppressors.&nbsp; The bombings happen because the people
        Israeli oppresses want change.&nbsp; They're sick of
        seeing their children being shot dead in cold blood by
        the sub-human Israeli soldiers. They're tired of being
        insulted and abused by the IDF in front of their
        children's eyes.&nbsp; They're fed up with Israeli
        soldiers routinely firing at their homes, farms,
        ambulances, etc.&nbsp; All the Palestinians want is their
        basic human rights...the right to live in the native land
        of Palestine they were born on, the right to be happy, to
        live life...the very rights Israeli scum deny them.
