<center>i thought it was extremely cute, defacing accelsgi.com in my name. i could do the same thing, and deface sites in kork/mafi0sa's name, but i'm not going to stoop to their level. in fact, this will be my last defacement. defacing is just too lame for me to continue with this little war. i would, however, like to end it on this note: you people don't realize how utterly pathetic you really are? you lie, you deface domains in my name, you can't even spell correctly. you beg me for code, kork, yet call me a lame clueless idiot. even people who hate me recognize the fact that i don't rely on public code, i write my own. unlike you, so this shout is to all of the "Quit Crew" fuck you, yo mama, yo daddy, everybody down with you and everybody who will be. i own all you little bitches. come get my dick stuck in your mouth just like mafi0sa did. lil' tricks.
