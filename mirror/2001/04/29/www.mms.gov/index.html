      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> SANYA (Hainan), April 26 (Xinhuanet) -- Some 1,000   
        people Thursday attended a memorial ceremony to mourn for Wang Wei, a   
        Chinese pilot died in a mid-air collision by a U.S. spy plane with Wang's   
        fighter jet on April 1.<br>  
        He was posthumously awarded with the title of &quot;Guardian of Territorial   
        Airspace and Waters.&quot; <br>  
        Navy officers and soldiers, Hainan Provincial leaders, officials from   
        Wang's hometown Huzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, and people of   
        all walks of life expressed their respect for Wang and grievance over   
        the pilot's death.<br>  
        Over the past 25 days and nights, Wang's relatives, friends and comrades-in-arms   
        have been hoping for his safe return.<br>  
        In his ten years' pilot career, Wang flied over 1,000 hours in some 2,000   
        flights and became a dauntless airman.<br>  
        During his mission of tracking and monitoring the U.S. reconnaissance   
        plane, Wang kept calm and firm to fulfill his task of safeguarding national   
        sovereignty and dignity.<br>  
        At 10:30 a.m. Thursday, Wang's relatives and comrades-in-arms and other   
        people embarked on a warship, holding his portrait, and steered to the   
        sea area off the Hainan Island, where his fighter jet was crashed by the   
        U.S. plane.<br>  
        To the funeral music, Wang's wife Ruan Guoqin offered up flowers Wang   
        himself planted during his lifetime. <br>  
        &quot;Wang Wei, you may rest in peace. I will take more care of our son   
        and educate him to become a useful person to serve the country, &quot;   
        Ruan said.<br>  
        Navy soldiers of Wang's unit expressed the will to follow Wang' s heroic   
        deeds to safeguard the country's airspace and waters. </font><br>
