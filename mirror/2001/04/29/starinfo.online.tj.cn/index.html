size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"> <p> Im at a loss. <p> <p> I read on www.securitynewsportal.com that  the FBI is looking for      poisonb0x and myself because they want to hand us over to China as a peace offering of sorts. I dont know is this is 
substanciated - but if it is.. Im stunned. I have never touched an American server. I have great pride in our country and       as sappy as it sounds - it made me proud to see our guys step up when China threatened us - and represent us in the global      security arena. Ive received an overwhelming amount of email supporting what im doing - so im going to keep doing it. FBI       - if youre really going to spend that much time and effort into busting someone standing up for your country - just email       me and ill save you the time. If this is untrue - then great - lets let this thing play out and see where we end up.  <p> <p>   <p> <p> puhrahfit@hushmail.com - pr0phet
