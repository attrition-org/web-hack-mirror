I'd like to share a revelation that I've had, during my time here. It
came to me when I tried to classify your species I realized that you're not
actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move
to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is
consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is
another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human
beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the
cure. </font></td></table>
