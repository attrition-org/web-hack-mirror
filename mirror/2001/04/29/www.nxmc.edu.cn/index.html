        Chinese guy. They were having a competition to see which one could walk
        his dog over the desert without needing a drink.
        <p>So the Englishman set off, but he only got half way.
        <p>Then the Scotsman set off, and he only got half way too.
        <p>But the Chinese guy managed to get all the way across the desert.
        <p>The Englishman and the Scotsman asked him how he could possibly do
        that without any water?
