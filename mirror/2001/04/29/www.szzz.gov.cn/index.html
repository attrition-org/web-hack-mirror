        &quot;Man,&quot; the American says. &quot;If I get another ham 'n'

        The next day, all three men get the same lunches, and they all three
        throw themselves in front of an oncoming train. At the funeral,
        everybody's crying.<br>
        &quot;This is all my fault!&quot; says the Italian's wife. &quot;If only
        I hadn't packed a slice of pizza that day.&quot;<br>

        &quot;Don't look at me,&quot; says the Chinese's wife. &quot;He packed
        his own lunch.&quot;</td>
