The aim of this work is to develop an expert system for automated analysis 
of protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR spectroscopy provides
an important technology for determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of 
biological molecules.  In order to interpret these data, the spectroscopist 
must correlate each peak in the spectrum with a specific atom in the protein 
sequence.  Once these "resonance assignments" are available, the intensities, 
splittings, and other spectral features of the NMR peaks can be interpreted to
provide structural information and a 3D image of the protein's structure.  
We have developed computer software capable of fully 
automated analysis of resonance assignments from NMR spectra.  This expert 
system, AUTOASSIGN, utilizes concepts from artificial intelligence to rapidly 
complete the analysis of resonance assignments. 
AUTOASSIGN is an expert system for automated analysis of resonance assignments
in protein NMR spectra. Proteins themselves are polymers of amino acids; there
are twenty naturally occurring types of amino acids which are put together in 
different sequences to make different proteins.  These chains then fold into 
unique 3D structures, which are the targets of structure determination and 
rational drug design.  Different NMR experiments generate spectra which 
contain different kinds of information.  Our laboratory is expert both in 
developing new NMR experiments which provide structural information for 
proteins, and in applying this technology to determine 3D structures of 
proteins. Typically, these spectra correlate NMR peaks in 2D plots or in 
3D or 4D volumes.  Such 3D or 4D data are difficult to analyze by humans, 
and can be more systematically analyzed by computer. <p>

AUTOASSIGN integrates an object-oriented knowledge base of amino acid 
structures with methods of constraint propagation from artificial 
intelligence.  The input to AUTOASSIGN is a set of 3D and 4D NMR spectra 
and the amino acid sequence of the protein (known from molecular biology 
methods).  The output is a list assigning each peak in these spectra to a 
specific atom in the protein's structure.  This mapping (or assignment 
process) allows further interpretation of the NMR data, which are used to 
generate 3D structures of the protein using other software.  <p>

The program has been developed and tested on literally hundreds of simulated 
NMR data sets, and on real data sets for five different proteins.  Each real 
NMR data set requires 1 - 2 weeks of NMR data collection.  The current 
version of AUTOASSIGN is highly robust and achieves complete and error-free 
analysis of real data for proteins containing 50 to 160 amino acids in 
10 - 30 min on a Sun Sparc2 workstation.  The next step of the work involves 
automation of the second stage of strucuture determination, namely the 
generation of distance constraints from multidimensional NMR spectra.  
These data can then be used to compute 3D structures of proteins using 
existing computer programs.  In this way the complete process of structure 
determination can be automated.<p>
