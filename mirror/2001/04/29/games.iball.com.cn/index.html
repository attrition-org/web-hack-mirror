 <center> Hackweiser > china <center> The media has taken a liking to this
whole predicament and it even seems as if the american papers are taking
pride that we have stepped up to combat america's reputation tooth and
nail. <center> We do feel sorry that your pilot died and quite frankly he
can burn in hell and none of this was supposed to happen, but since you
publically threatend then infrastructure of our digital front then we must
combat you on human instinct. <center> China has stepped up and we are
waiting to see if they can combat the force of the american hackers, which
we seriously doubt since you were hit on such a large scale. <center> IF
the attack on Labor day and on the date of the embassy bombing in bejing
do occur then you will see the forces that america posses. Hackweiser has
been holding back to an extent waiting for you to attack us, if you do you
will regret it.
 <center>now for the rumor that the fbi is hunting for the heads of
pr0phet and pb0x, well think about it fbi...sending China a couple
defacers isn't going to stop a cyber war that has already been supposidly
strategically planned, only distill the effects temporarily until it
erupts into a full blown war both on the digital and physical front.
<center>Seeing china threaten the united states in a realm where we dwell
supreme and then seeing the united states hackers fight back with such a
furious force shows that we are not a nationality to be threatened on the
digital warfront. <center>We got a good kick out of the boxes name you
silly azn's: <center>[I have no name!@game /root] <center>Hackweiser Asian
Domination y2k1! <center>You can contact hackweiser for this even at:
