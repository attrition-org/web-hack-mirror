<!--in and out, like poppin a prom queens cherry and gettinout before her parents come home with only a stank used condom as the evidence. anyways, logs were handled as iam sure you can figure. how you guys got this far with-out getting tagged i'll keep guessing at, but really, nt is shit...mmkay? anway for help - install recent service packs, alittle user auditing wouldnt hurt. (passwords, rights,ACL's etc) and check your running services. or just geta better operating system. it would be the best way to go, anyway if ya got questions flames, etc, email me at mr_o@disinfo.net, peace im outtie.....-->

<i>side notes</i><font color="#ff0000"><b>:</b></font> to the chinese hax0rizers. ok fella's it's like this...<br>
sure, your angry cuz you lost some pilot of yours. i could understand that, but understand our position...<br>
we're pissed off cuz your dumbass &quot;pilot&quot; was a moron and crashed into one of ours. i mean c'mon now guys, he was
in a supposedly highly maneuverable and agile &quot;fighter&quot; jet. our boys where in a fuckin flying dildo with  propeller engines. not agile at all. who's fault you think this really was? think about that one for a second. then you can either choose to be blinded by your pathetically justified patriotism for you ignorant pilot who basically killed himself, ooooor, you can, oh i dont know, <b>maybe come up with a fucking individual thought of <u>your own</u> and quit allowing that damn communist crap to take the better of you...</b><br>
<br> 
and to all the sympathesizers, believe it or not i can also feel you as well. for some reason or another you've come to dislike our great country for one reason or another. maybe spite over how conceided and gluttonous we are or perhaps just good 'ol jealousy it's the usual story. but just think, where would the world be without us? really take the time to ponder that one... here's a little test, look around your domiscile, take a step outside your door, take a walk around the block. now, when you get back, try to recall all the things that come from <b>our</b> influences... from the chevy corvette advertisement outside to the fuckin nike's on your feet that cousin wong stole from the factory he's employed at making them... when it all comes down to it, i mean we aren't #1 for nothing. started off with twelve colonies and been woopin ass since... i don't care what nationality you are, through history we've helped some time or another. and to think, disect this whole problem and all it comes down to is distance and politics... and that ain't no ponejammeh...<br>
<br>
p.s: <i>silveronfire</i>, your amusing like an infant using the potty chair for the first time. but i just wanted you to know yew can lick deez nuts because your pathetic. the lil counter thingy, gay... oh ya and a message from some of your fellow countrymen (my friends) &quot;seu fazer-nos o bad do olhar, para o bullshit você morons!&quot;<br>
