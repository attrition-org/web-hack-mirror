    <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>
    &quot; ARAB COMMUNICATION GROUP &quot; ( ACG )</b> was the first to foray into the
    demanding field of specialized industrial exhibitions, it was established in 1986 to
    organise the first printing and packaging trade show in Egypt <b>&quot; PrintPack 88
    &quot;</b>. <br>
    <br>
    Organising such a difficult and challenging exhibition ensured that the company started
    very strong. <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>The company's growth led to organise high profile international exhibitions
    including:</i> &quot; <font color="#000000">Plastex</font> 92 &quot;</b> (The
    Pan-Arab/African Plastic and Rubber Exhibition) and <b>&quot;ITCE 94 &quot;</b> (The
    Pan-Arab/African Exhibition for Textile, Embroidery &amp; Sewing Machinery, Accessories
    &amp; Finished Products ). <br>
    <br>
    The company's early success was attributed to a professional and enlightened management
    that was based on introducing and exceeding the highest international standards, paying
    attention to details meticulously, thoroughly studying the industry's needs and a clear
    vision for the future. <br>
    <br>
    <b>In 1995</b>, the company organised the biggest <em><strong>&quot; Vehicles, Buses,
    Motorcar Worshops, Automobile Spare Parts &amp; Accessories Exhibition &quot;</strong></em>
    in Egypt and the Arab World, namely <b>&quot; Automech 96 &quot;</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>In 1996</b>, having three international branches in <b>Singapore, Cyprus and England</b>
    as well as <b>15 trade representative offices</b> throughout the world, <b>ACG</b> became
    the biggest Arab Group for organising international exhibitions and conferences in Egypt
    and the Middle East.<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>November 4th, 1999</b></i> a partnership agreement was signed between <b>ACG</b> and
    the UK based <b>ITE</b> Group Plc. one of the biggest exhibition organising companies
    worldwide (ITE Group organises around <b>150 trade shows</b> per year ). <br>
    <br>
    This association crowned the company's success and firmly placed <i><b>ACG &amp; ITE as
    the leading exhibition organiser in Egypt and the Middle East. </b></i></font></p>
