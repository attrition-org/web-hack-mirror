<center>I borrowed this webpage to let Kork know she's not the only person
who can deface a domain. The original content can be found <a href="index.bak">here</a>.
I'm not going to rant, I only have 3 questions; a) you live three thousand
miles from me, you've never met me, you've never seen me in person, you've
never seen nakid pictures of me, so how do you know how big my dick
is? b) i'm clueless? the sar11 admin confirmed you rooted their box with a
./ exploit from packetstorm, you begged me for programming help yet i'm
clueless. why? c) you admittedly suck off horses. how can anyone who
orally pleasures a horse call me lame?!<br>bye, for now. -skrilla
