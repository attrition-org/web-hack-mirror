<center>Sit down you silly asians and let uncle hackweiser tell you a story...

<center> Once upon a time there was a plane, we'll call him Sammy the Spy Plane.  Now

Sammy liked to fly all over and use his high tech equipment to make sure no one was doing

anything naughty.  But one day Sammy was flying through international airspace and

accidentally hit his friend Garry the Gook Jet!  Sammy tumbled and tossed and crash

landed on an island belonging to China.  Gary was very upset that he was hit and Sammy

felt very sorry for it and he even said sorry, but Gary was insistant and he decided to

lock sammy away in a cage so he couldn't go home to visit all of his family and friends

in the United States.  Gary laughed at Sammy for being weak willed and this made the rest

of Sammy's family very angry.  So then Gary's family started to see that they have made a

mistake and delivered all of the cargo abboard Sammy back to his family.  His family

recieved all of the cargo except for one missing bag.  Well, where is this missing

bag?  You see boys and girls, Gary shot him!  Bad Gook jet, bad bad jet! but anyways boys

and girls, Sammy was still stuck on the island and Gary's family won't give Sammy back to

his family unless they come out into public and admit they are weak.  Well, no sir does

such a proud family ever compromise itself!  You see, instead of bargaining with Gary's

family, Sammy's mom and dad decided to ask their friend Mr. Nuclee R. Warhead for advice

and Mr. Warhead had the perfect idea! "Why don't we just blow the fuckers to hell?",

suggested Mr. Warhead. "What a splendid idea sir!", said Sammy's dad, who is a retarded

college frat boy.  So instead of bargaining Sammy's family decided to launch a precision

air strike against Garry's family and destroy their entire country and sparking world war

3! What fun!

<center>What a shame! Looks like were out of time kids :(.

<center> Well maybe next week we can see if evil Mr. China will let Sammy go home to his

family or maybe Sammy's family will blow China sky high!

<center>Until next time kiddie's, watch the skies.
