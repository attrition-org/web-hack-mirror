          anomalies.&nbsp; Note: A quicklook does not satisfy a unit's Command 
          Assessment of Readiness and Training (CART) requirements (see longlook 
          below).&nbsp; Unit personnel required for a quicklook are the Link 
          Management Team, Track Supervisor/TIC, ID Operator, AAWC Operator, 
          SSWC/SSSC Operator, SWC/AWIC, FWC, and AIC/ASTAC.&nbsp; An informal 
          debriefing is conducted upon completion of the test.
		 <BR><BR> 
<li><b><A name=longlook>Link-11 longlook:</A></b>&nbsp; A comprehensive (8 to 12 hour) link readiness analysis comprised of 
          hardware (snapshot) and extensive TADIL software verification 
          tests.&nbsp; This procedure tests and exercises every functional area 
          and feature of a platform's TDS program and associated equipment, as 
          well as crew datalink knowledge and proficiency.&nbsp; This test will 
          verify that the proper M-series messages are being translated 
          correctly in accordance with MILSTD-6011 OS-411 Series.&nbsp; For a 
          longlook, the unit&#8217;s entire TADIL team is required (see quicklook 
          above).&nbsp; It is imperative that the unit&#8217;s most experienced 
          operators are manning the consoles for the data recording phase.&nbsp; 
          This will enable a timely longlook test with smaller, cleaner, and 
          more accurate files for our analysts to validate.&nbsp; On the second 
          day of the longlook, units are encouraged to use this test as 
          comprehensive link team refresher training and a gauge of their 
          overall link readiness.<SPAN STYLE= "background-color:yellow">At comex, we 
          recommend all OCSOT or Condition III stations (dependent upon TDS 
          system) be manned and all weapon interfaces be online.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
          longlook is mandatory after a major TADIL program revision, prior to 
          CART II, or once per training cycle in accordance with FXP-3 
          (CCC-28-SF), Surface Force Training Manual (CNSP/CNSLINST 3502.2C), 
          and Aircraft Carrier Training and Readiness Manual (CNAP/CNALANT INST 
          3500.20).&nbsp; longlook testing is most strongly recommended for 
          ISIC/TG pre-deployment work-up and preparatory to Joint Task Force 
          Exercises (JTFEX) to minimize multi-force/unit interoperability 
          issues.&nbsp; Post longlook feedback in the form of an informal 
          debrief and a service summary report is provided to the tested unit 
          (normally within 3 to 5 weeks).&nbsp; Units are requested to 
          record/extract their system(s) data during the conduct of the longlook and 
          forward CND/C2P tapes to their respective software development agency 
          upon completion of testing.&nbsp; During the debrief, the unit 
          commander will have the opportunity to receive candid feedback, both 
          objective (hardware/software) and subjective 
          (personnel/training/procedural), on his unit&#8217;s TADIL readiness from a 
          fleet-seasoned, link-experienced and unbiased perspective.&nbsp; If 
          you desire the ability to effectively manage your unit&#8217;s tactical data 
          link, then a longlook is a must.&nbsp; Additionally, NCTSI is 
          available for follow-up assistance as required/requested.
          <BR><BR>
<li><b><A name=longlook16>Link-16 longlook:</A>&nbsp;</b> Link-16 longlook testing is similar to Link-11 
testing.&nbsp; NCTSI will verify that the unit under test can correctly process the basic 
system information needed to exchange data for link operation. This includes verification og JTIDS Unit (JU) track numbers,
Network Participation Group (NPG) number for PPLI and platform status, and that the unit can correctly 
          transmit and receive engagement and system status messages as well as 
          command messages.&nbsp; Although the Surface Force Training Manual does not yet mandate this test, it is highly 
		  recommended by all Link-16 (TADIL-J) units to ensure complete multi-TADIL interoperability.&nbsp; 
          This test will verify that the proper J-series messages are being translated correctly in accordance with MILSTD-6016 and 
		  OS-516 Series. 
		  <BR>
		  <b>NOTE:</b> When conducting JTIDS operations, the unit under test or the NCTSI detachment must obtain approval from the
		  Geographical Area Assignment Coordinator (GAAC).  Under normal area operating conditions, three working days are needed to
		  obtain deconfliction from the GAAC.

<li><b><A name=link4a>Link-4A</A> Operational/Diagnostic Test:&nbsp;</b> This test verifies readiness 
and identifies any Link 4A problems.&nbsp; Utilizing this resource eliminates the need for live 
          aircraft services which are expensive, limited in availability, and 
          inconsistent in duplicating problems.&nbsp; During this test, 
          <b>Detachments ONE, TWO, and FIVE </b>are able to 
          simulate up to 10 aircraft, generate reply messages in accordance with 
          parameters preselected by the operator (AIC), display specific 
          numerical data and discrete data reports received, and respond to 
          heading, altitude, and speed change commands received from the control 
          station. &nbsp; <b>Detachments ONE, TWO, and FIVE</b> do not validate your 
          system.&nbsp; Validation is conducted by SESEF Range during CSRR.
         <BR><BR>

          transmitter-receiver.&nbsp; This is a non-certification test designed 
          for operational testing and operator training/proficiency.&nbsp; 
          Although this test is not mandated, it is essential for optimum task 
          group link interoperability.<SPAN STYLE= "background-color:yellow">&nbsp; NOTE: 
          When requesting SATLINK-11 
          services, the requesting unit is responsible for timely submission of

<li><b><A name=stir>System TADIL Interoperability Report (STIR):</a>&nbsp;</b> is the only publication that describes in 
          detail the potential impact of current differences between Link 11 and 
          Link 16 message implementation (such as occur between Model 4 and 
          Model 5 platforms) and respective translations for the individual 
          units within a deploying task group.&nbsp; The STIR addresses selected 
          high interest Link-11/16 message sets (M/J/N) that support air, 
          surface, and sub-surface mission areas and identifies the capabilities 
          (unique link implementation) of each platform to transmit and receive 
          the Link-11/16 information most frequently used by operators.&nbsp; 
          The STIR provides the means for warfare commanders and operators to 
          determine how all task group platforms interact with each other via 
          the different data links.&nbsp; It also provides an understanding of 
          how Link-16 information, or lack thereof, could effect contact 
          identification and/or engagements.&nbsp; <b>Detachments ONE, TWO, and 
          FIVE</b> will assist task group commanders in resolving STIR
