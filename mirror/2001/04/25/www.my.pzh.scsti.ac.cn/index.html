I know that our President Mr Bush cant support or approve of my defacing. But I want for him to somehow know that he is supported with his decision to support taiwan by most all hackers I know. His firm stance and statement to do - whatever needed _ is the boldest Ive heard from a president in a long time. China - watch your asses. You got bad ass presidents and bad ass hackers after you - remember hiroshima?
