hi
<p> 
seems i have some explaining to do about why ive been bashing nt defacing lately.
<p> 
let me just address all the questions with one statement. - i do not think NT defacing in general is lame. what i think is lame is the way these groups have been popping up acting hardcore - when NT is their ONLY talent. WoH is the only one i respect because they only hit BIG shit. i still think unicode.pl requires far less talent to use then alot of other scripts used for linux / irix / and solaris - but i dont think ANY of what we do is hard. its just an opinion though.
