<center><h1> 0wned by Kork of the quit crew </h1></center>
mmmk now i dont deface often but i know something that i simply MUST share
with the rest of you and it might be a little distatefull so i have
decided to change the peoples names so that the poor guy dosent get too
embaressed<br>
right theres this guy lets call him <b>ruben, skrilla, unistd<br>
</b>now this guy has a 4 inch cock and its not even a whole inch in
diameter (thats smaller than most pencils) and he cant even get all 4
inches inside before he starts bursting off a load<br>but when he DOES
eventually get it in and decides to fuck you he hammers it in fast and
finishes in normally less than 30 seconds<br>
my parting comment to skrilla/unistd/ruben is that perhaps you should try
fucking something that would be a little tighter around that pencil of
yours like a big cat?<br>
any comments direct them to <a
href="mailto:kork@kisstimes.com">kork@kisstimes.com</a><br>
as for now lets get back to the matter at hand <br>
