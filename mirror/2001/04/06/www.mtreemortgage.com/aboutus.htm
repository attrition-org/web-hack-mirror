      <p>Money Tree Mortgage was established in 1996 by a group of mortgage banking 
        professionals, each with over 10 years experience in the lending industry. 
        Our purpose was to create an organization which not only focuses on our 
        customer's needs, but also on their experience before, during and after 
        their transaction. </p>
      <p>While most lenders focus on nothing other than advertising for their 
        next customer, our ultimate goal is to provide our clients with world 
        class service during their loan process, and relationship building, value 
        added information and communication after their transaction. By doing 
        this, we create an environment where our borrowers are so satisfied with 
        our service, that they refer their friends, family and co-workers to us 
        for their lending needs. </p>
