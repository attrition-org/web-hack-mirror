      <p>For salaried borrowers:</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>For self-employed borrowers: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Wingdings">v </font>Complete Federal tax returns for past 
          2 years (this must include all pages) Be sure to include all K1's (partnerships)

      <p>In either case if you own other residential real estate which you rent 
        you may need to present lease agreements and a lender always needs your 
        1040's for the past 2 years. </p>
      <p>If your tax returns are "on extension" you will need a copy of the request 
        for extension. </p>
      <p>If this is a purchase transaction you will need a fully executed copy 
        (signed by both parties) of the sales contract. </p>

      <p><b>What is prequalifying? </b></p>
      <p>Prequalifying is a process whereby a loan officer takes information about 
        you, either over the telephone or face-to-face and indicates how big a 
        loan of a particular type you will qualify for. The lender would then 
        give you a "prequalification letter" which is of considerable value in 
        dealing with a Realtor or a potential seller. Realtors and sellers are 
        interested in dealing with people whom they know to be able to get the 
        loan necessary to close the deal. Most lenders prefer to get the income 
        and asset information from you, get a loan application and prequalifying 
        credit report and then write the letter. <br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p><b>What is preapproval? </b></p>
      <p>Preapproval is a step beyond prequalifying. In a preapproval you are 
        actually approved for an amount and for a certain type of loan. The preapproval 
        is contingent you finding or making an offer on a property. </p>
      <p>With a preapproval you can close the loan faster and often will find 
        your offer more acceptable to the seller. Sometimes sellers are anxious 
        and will take somewhat less in price from someone who can close quickly.
