<!--
in and out, like poppin a prom queens cherry and gettin
out before her parents come home with only a stank used 
condom as the evidence. anyways, logs were handled as i
am sure you can figure. how you guys got this far with-
out getting tagged i'll keep guessing at, but really, 
nt is shit...
mmkay? anway for help - install recent service packs, a
little user auditing wouldnt hurt. (passwords, rights,
ACL's etc) and check your running services. or just get
a better operating system. it would be the best way to 
go, anyway if ya got questions flames, etc, email me at 
mr_o@disinfo.net, peace im outtie.....

admin: alrighty, welp. first, take a deep breath, then, exhale. continue as necessary until you muster up the power to grab the bottle of jack in your desk and grab a glass. now, pour a nice tall glass and down the entire thing. repeat as seen necessary. three, while performing steps one and two you should be on the phone making plans to go to the nudey bar within the hour. three, since skipping of steps is not allowed you should be feeling a little better now. ok, its like this.. nothing was harmed, though you may not see the benefits now take into consideration, hmmm. a simple moved index.html > fux0r_old? an some fux0red logs? ooor... some really wacky bastard formatting everything or something. anyway just remember we didnt attack you or your ego, just the sec of this thingy. anyway remember fux0r luvs yew and much alcohol will be consumed in your honor.
