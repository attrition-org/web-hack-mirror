<font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"> Some words for the media sites. <p> <p> Ever since the China air scandal happened -  
and this so called cyber war got started - There has been way too much emphasis on Chinas threat to attack our countries  
servers. Why is it everyone is focusing on that instead of the fact that poisonb0x - hackweiser - and myself have cracked
nearly 300 of Chinas sites. Not to mention all the ones that were comprimised not running sites. <p> <p> There have been a
few sites like www.securitywatch.com and www.washingtonpost.com that have reported on how badly Chinas servers were
getting taken over - but the moajority of the news sites like CNN and what not want to focus on Chinas threats. Hell
people - weve acted on ours - and quite convincingly I might add. Im not after praise - I just think the US should get the
credit it deserves for stepping up to this threat - and responding so well. <p> <p> Ive said before that I really dont    
hate China the country or Chinese people - but this whole thing with their crackers declaring war kind of aggrivated me   
into kind if saying - oh yeh? Call it pride. For all of you that email me and all of you that deface - I encourage you to
do what you can to respond to Chinas threats on us. Scan servers and share results - own sites yourself - share vuln -    
share code - whatever. It doesnt have to be bad only - Scan our servers and report vuln you find to our adminds and help  
them prepare. Its almost May 1 so I guess we will see who comes out ahead in this little game were calling a cyber
war. <p> <p> <p> <p> puhrahfit@hushmail.com - pr0phet
