<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A major proportion of Ireland's
and Europe's wealth-creating activity is Science - based. For this reason,
Governments and the industrial sectors invest heavily in the training and
education of young scientists, who are essential to economic development.
This is reflected very strongly in Ireland's ERDF projects - a high proportion
of which are scientifically based. There is an exciting future in Ireland
and in EU partner countries, for technicians and scientists, educated in
specialist fields, but more importantly, with the hands-on experience of
the sophisticated scientific equipment, used in modern laboratories. These
laboratories form an essential part of most modern industries and Government
Departments such as Environment, Marine and Agriculture, Food and Forestry.
Science courses at Sligo Regional Technical College provide this hands-on
training. In 1994, Sligo Regional Technical College invested heavily in
providing new, state-of-the-art laboratories, for training of students,
particularly in the areas of Applied Biology, Food Science, Analytical
Chemistry and Environmental Science. The School of Science is a dynamic
part of the College and provided the first Honours Degree in Environmental
Science in Ireland and also graduated the first PH D in the whole Regional
College system. In the Academic year 1993/94, the School of Science produced
26 graduates with Honours Degrees, 7 Post-Graduates Diplomas, 25 M Sc Degrees
by course work, 2 M Sc Degrees by Research and one PH D. The School of
Science has two departments Department of Applied Science Department of
Environmental Science A wide range of courses exist within the School,
at National Certificate, National Diploma, Honours Degree, and Post Graduate
levels. Students are recruited mainly from Leaving Certificate into National
Certificate courses in Applied Biology, Applied Chemistry and Food Science.
Recruitment to any of the above three Certificate courses is through a
common first year general science foundation course, with students indicating
their preferences at the end of the first year. This provides students,
who may not have taken all three science subjects to Leaving Certificate
with an opportunity to gain knowledge in each one. Entry to a particular
option in second year is subject to availability of places.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are two, long serving
National Diploma courses:- National Diploma in Science (Pollution Assessment
and Control) National Diploma in Science (Analytical Chemistry)&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Students may enter these
Diploma courses by one of two modes, from Leaving Certificate or by progression
from National Certificate courses.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The School of Science has
Honours Degree courses in Applied Chemistry and Applied Biology, run jointly
with Coventry University. Students wishing to attend these courses are
recruited from Leaving Certificate to the appropriate National Diploma
in Science, spend second year in Coventry University, third year in Sligo
RTC and fourth year in Coventry University. They obtain two qualifications,
a National Diploma (NCEA) and an Honours Degree (Coventry University).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The School of Science at
Sligo Regional Technical College has a very active Post-Graduate Section,
where suitably qualified students may register for Post-Graduate Diplomas
and Masters in Science based on course work. In addition, there are approximately
ten post graduate students involved in research at M Sc and Ph D level.
A new Diploma will commence in the academic year 1995/96 in the area of
Safety, Health and Industrial Hygiene subject to the agreement of the NCEA
and Department of Education. This is a critical and fast-growing area with
all facets of employment in Ireland. Students will be recruited, mainly
from Leaving Certificate, but progression may also take place from appropriate
Certificate courses.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The School of Science has
strong links with third level institution, within the European Union. There
are several ERASMUS and COMETT programmes involving both students and lecturer
exchanges with Coventry University (UK), Middlesex University (UK), Giessen
Fachhochschule (Germany), Bremen Fachhochschule (Germany), University of
Florence (Italy), University of Limoges (France) and others.&nbsp;</font></font>
