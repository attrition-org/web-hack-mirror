<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The School of Business and
Humanities has a long and successful tradition of high quality education
and is dedicated to the provision of full-time and part-time courses of
academic excellence and vocational relevance. It offers courses at degree,
diploma, certificate and professional level to cover 1100 full-time students.
The School's strong portfolio of courses which has a high national and
international profile covers areas such as Business Studies, Accountancy,
Computing, Office Information Systems, Marketing and Languages, European
Business, Art and Design and Applied Social Studies. All of these disciplines
contain the facility for students to transfer from Certificate to Diploma
and progression from Diploma to Degree is also available to students of
Accountancy, Languages and Marketing and European Business.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>While the School is justly
proud of its academic achievements over the years, it is also very conscious
of the necessity of preparing students for the real world of work. This
is in part accomplished by the inclusion of the curriculum of subjects
such as Computing, Languages, Enterprise, Organisational Behaviour, Projects
with field trips as well as mandatory periods of work placement on certain
courses in particular should enable students to better cope with the rapidly
changing work environment of the 1990's.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A significant feature of
the School of Business and Humanities is its strong commitment to the importance
of developing links with other institutions of learning in Europe. The
School has links with partner Colleges in France, Germany, Greece, Spain,
Portugal, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United
Kingdom. Under the ERASMUS Programme in excess of 60 students from partner
Colleges in the EU will spend a period of study, usually extending over
one academic year, attending courses in this School. The mingling of so
many foreign students with the Irish student population serves as an enriching
influence on the academic, cultural and social life of the College generally
and the School of Business and Humanities in particular. Reciprocal arrangements
under the ERASMUS Programme also facilitate our students to undertake periods
of study in Colleges in the EU and during this academic year over 50
Diploma students are undertaking courses in International Marketing, Tourism,
Computer Applications and Computing in France, Germany, Spain and Portugal.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The staff of the School of
Business and Humanities are ever conscious of the rapid changes taking
place in society and of the demands which these changes place upon them
as educators. In response to these changes, staff of the School are continually
updating their knowledge and skills thus ensuring that graduates are made
familiar with the most up-to-date theory and practice in their subject
areas. Equally, staff are also keenly aware of the necessity for a supportive
learning student environment where the development of the individual student
is closely monitored to ensure that each one receives that individual attention
and personal support which in turn should enable them to achieve maximum
potential now and in their future careers.&nbsp;</font></font>
