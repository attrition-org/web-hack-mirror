<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The School of Engineering
consists of two Departments, the Department of Civil Engineering and Construction
Studies and the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Electronics. There
are 650 wholetime equivalent students taking courses at Certificate, Diploma
and Degree level all validated by the National Council for Educational
Awards and there is also an involvement in the education of apprentices.
Areas of particular specialisation in the School are Quality Assurance,
Tool Design and Water Engineering.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the strongest features
of the course structure in the School is the facility for students to progress
from an initial Certificate programme to Degree level programmes. Examples
are as follows:&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>1. National Diploma holders
with Merit in either Science or Engineering are considered for admission
to the Bsc programmes within the School of Engineering.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>2. Students on the National
Certificate in Electronic or Mechanical Engineering following selection
on merit may avail of a joint study programme with the University of Coventry
leading to a BEng (Combined Engineering).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>3. Graduates from all Certificate
and Diploma programmes have successfully transferred to Degree Programme
in the past.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Advanced plans exist for
the widening of this process to allow easy access to new degree programmes
within the School. The School offers a particular welcome and encouragement
to girls as it feels that traditional attitudes militate against girls
even considering courses in Engineering. When girls have taken the programmes
available, they have been most successful, regularly topping the class.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Areas of research in the
School coincide with the specialisations in Quality, Tool Design and Water
Engineering. The most obvious example of this is the <a href="toolmaking_centre.html">National
Toolmaking Centre</a> which is located on the Campus and which houses the
Toolmaking Industry Research and Advisory Centre.&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;</td>
