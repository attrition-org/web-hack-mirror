<p>Ok, this has been bothering me for some time.  I don't understand why people always want to judge
others. If someone
wants to go around DoSing everyone online, so be it.  If one of those victims wants to retaliate, great.
Is it wrong?
Legally I suppose it is.  Morally, I don't see anything disturbing about it.  Just like <i>hacking</i> is
a touchy subject. You
got hackers, crackers, phreakers, script kiddies, packet kiddies, etc., and nobody seems to get along
with the others.
I say fuck it, who cares.  Call me anything you want, I know what I am.  Another thing, I've notice
nobody seems to
like the Windows defacements.  Why is that?  I've never hacked into a Windows box so I don't know how
hard it is.  I've
seem some pretty easy hacking tools out there.  Almost <i>point and click</i> easy.  For the most part I
dont' see how
the operating system has anything to do with the skill level of the attacker.  Everyone
does their own thing and lets just respect that, aight?</p><br>
