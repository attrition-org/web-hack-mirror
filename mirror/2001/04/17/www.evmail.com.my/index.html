    <BR>
  <P align=left><B>NOTES :</B><BR>
    Why we defaced?? Okey, now we tell you why. We have been tried to email most 
    of admin that their server was hacked by us<br>
    but most of'em ignore our email coz they think it just was a normal mail something 
    not too important.so, this is why. we dont <br>
    want to make a dumb thing. Just think about it. So, we think the BEST way 
    to make most of admin learn is to defaced their webpage. Remember when we 
    defaced a website it means we own your hard disk or your CPU. Sorry about 
    this! <br>
    &quot; NO FILE HARM &quot;<br>
    <BR>
  <P align=left><B>Patch :</B><BR>1. The simple way to protect your system from 
this bugs you just can install BSD OS<BR>2. IIS 4.0 
http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/critical/q269862/default.asp<BR>3.

<P align=left><B>Comment :</B><BR>We would like to say sorry for what we have 
done. But we have to because if we dont do this others people will do. <BR>And 
its more danger if forign intruders get into our (Malaysian) system. We know 
this illegal and we could put ourself <BR>into a *JAIL*. WE AGREE what our 
goverment try to build and create on our country MSC, CyberJaya and so 
on.<BR>Who knows we are fanatic about our 'IT Security'. </P>
<P align=left>We can go further on every step we try to reach. 'Malaysia Boleh'. 
Once again 'WE WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE'<BR>to all Malaysian. Let us know what we 
should do. Coz we just cant stop 'how fanatic we are' about IT Security. We just 
hope we have our good community just like other people. We dont have enuf money 
to make our own building or rakan muda, HQ or something like a center for us to 
say, come out with our knowledge. WE DONT HAVE ANY WHITE PAPERS, DEGREE, DIPLOMA 
and so on. Just look how poor my english is.<BR><BR>To all Malaysian once again 
*SORRY* for what we have done.</P>
<P align=left>PEACE!!!<BR></P>
