  <p align="left"><b>Comment :</b><br>
    We would like to say sorry for what we have done. But we have to because if 
    we dont do this others people will do. And its more danger <br>
    if forign intruders get into our (Malaysian) system. We know this illegal 
    and we could put ourself into a *JAIL*. WE AGREE what our goverment<br>
    try to build and create on our country MSC, CyberJaya and so on. Who knows 
    we are fanatic about our 'IT Security'. </p>
  <p align="left">We can go further on every step we try to reach. 'Malaysia Boleh'. 
    Once again 'WE WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE' to all Malaysian.<br>
    Let us know what we should do. Coz we just cant stop 'how fanatic we are' 
    about IT Security. We just hope we have our good community just like <br>
    other people. We dont have enuf money to make our own building or rakan muda, 
    HQ or something like a center for us to say, come out with our<br>
    knowledge. WE DONT HAVE ANY WHITE PAPERS, DEGREE, DIPLOMA and so on. Just 
    look how poor my english is.<br>
    <br>
    To all Malaysian once again *SORRY* for what we have done.</p>
  <p align="left">PEACE!!!<br>
