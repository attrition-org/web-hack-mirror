<p>Our school was opened on the 11th September <strong>1959</strong> with 113 students
with the school colours of Royal blue and orange. A globe of the world was adopted as the
school logo in <strong>1962</strong> to relate to our school name of&nbsp; &quot;<em>a
fair view of all things</em>&quot;. A new logo was introduced during the <strong>1980's.</strong></p>

<p>During <strong>1978</strong> three classrooms and a new library were added to
accomodate the increase in numbers.</p>

<p>In<strong> 1982</strong> the four factions were given a name representing a locality of
Collie.</p>

<p>Red - <strong><font color="#FF0000">Cardiff</font></strong> - originally an important
coal mining area that supported a big township. It became a virtual ghost town during the <strong>1960's</strong>.
It is situated about 13 km south east of Collie.</p>

<p>Blue - <font color="#0000A0"><strong>Ewington</strong> </font>- situated about 5 km's
north east of Collie, it was the site of open cut coal mining between <strong>1952 - 60</strong>.</p>

<p>Green - <font color="#2B803E"><strong>Cheetara</strong></font><font color="#3AAF55"> </font>-
a large housing estate at the northern end of town.</p>

<p>Gold -<font color="#EFDA16"><strong> Stockton</strong></font><font color="#D9CE02"> </font>-
a large mine about 10 km's east of the town. It was closed in the early <strong>1960's</strong>
and is now filled with water and used as a recreation area.</p>

<p>A new wing of classrooms with an activity area was opened in <strong>1992</strong>
along with a purpose built library and undercover area.</p>
