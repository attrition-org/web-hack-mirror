<font color=red>W</font>orld <font color=red>o</font>f <font color=red>H</font>ell rooting sites in the year 2001. Looking for new members, if you're interested, <a href="mailto:woh@yours.com">mail us asap</a>. We're looking for coders.. no script kiddies please =)<br><br>
<b>0wn3d.</b> In response to <a href="mailto:fejed@optushome.com.au?subject=you're a lamer! :)">a-lamer</a>'s email, subject <i>"try hitting something else but iis servers."</i> - This box is not NT m'kay? I can hit any fucking OS I like, unlike you. You seem to be a child who can't get his unicode.pl to work and so decides to flame people like me who can ./0wn IIS.. <b>and</b> Solaris <b>and</b> Linux. So, fuck you. Oh yeah, I'm a script kiddie too, <a href="adm1n.pl">can't code any Perl to save my life</a>, heh.<br>

<b><u>Updates</u></b>: I think this is bullshit, however... Apparantly the feds are after me and the rest of WoH. *gulp* I'm sooo scared (you'd think they'd be wasting their time trying to catch the <i>real</i> criminals, heh). Anyways, because of this, and due to the fact I have ./0wn3d just about every company possible, I'm out of the defacing scene. It's been great to be here, and I have met a lot of new friends and seen the work of some elite guys (pr0phet, Quit Crew etc, you all know who you are..). I'd like to say this, I am not one of those lame NT defacers like PoizonB0x etc, I simply chose to own a few <b>big domain</b> NT boxes for a change. It was a phase, got a problem with that? Bite me. Wanna own Epson.co.kr just like me? Well, <i>telnet www.epson.co.kr 2325</i> - Yes, I backdoored them. Shock horror. I leave it up to you. It's been a great month this, and I hope to see some wicked defacements in the future.<br><br>

Today is my birthday. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday dear "lame hax0r dude with no lifeeeeee," Happy birthday to me.<br><br>
You think my birthday and me quitting the scene on the same day have anything in common? Check my alldas interview... heh. L8rZ,<br><br>
Yours,<br>
