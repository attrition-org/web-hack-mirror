occupied Arab territories, including Palestine.<br>
Geneva 28 March 2001</strong></font></p>

<p>Statement under agenda item 8: Question of the violation of human rights In the
occupied Arab territories, including Palestine.</p>

<p>I have the honor to speak&nbsp; on behalf of the&nbsp; European Union. The central and
eastern European countries associated with the European Union - Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia - and the
associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey have expressed the wish to align themselves
with this statement. </p>

<p>Over the last twelve months, the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, has
deteriorated markedly. Confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians have had dramatic
implications on the situation regarding human rights and international humanitarian law in
the occupied Palestinian territories, including the territories administered by the
Palestinian Authority. The seriousness of the circumstances warranted the Commission on
Human Rights to hold a Special Se5sion on the Situation in Palestine in October 2000. The
situation has since remained critical. </p>

<p>The European Union has called repeatedly on the parties in the conflict to do their
outmost to bring an end to the violence The European Union has urged the parties to meet
in a constructive spirit to secure the urgent resumption of the dialogue. It is the firm
belief of the European Union that a sustainable solution can only be found through
peaceful negotiations. The European Union expresses its ho that Mr. Sharon as Prime
Minister together with President Arafat will maintain the momentum of the peace process
and the peace dialogue. The European Union is convinced that the progress made should form
the basis.., for future talks on the permanent status. The European Union reaffirms its
view that the basis of negotiations, and of a just and lasting peace, must be Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338 and other relevant United Nations resolutions. The
European Union reiterates the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war, the
right for every state in the area to live in security and to exist in secure
internationally recognized borders and the principle of land for peace. The European Union
expresses its grave concern at and strongly condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The European Union is through its High Representative involved in the works of the
international Javier Solana actively involved in the works of the international
fact-finding committee, chaired by US Senator Mitchell, which was established following
the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in October 2000. The EU is confident that the fact-finding
committee can contribute to restoring confidence in peace and help both parties to restart
dialogue and cooperation as the only way forward to halt violence and prevent blood-shed.
The European Union welcomes full cooperation by both parties with the committee, urges
this to continue and looks forward to its report. </p>

<p>Human rights are universal, and apply throughout the world, irrespective of country,
culture or specific situation. They apply to everyone, without distinction. Respect for
human rights constitutes the foundation for all sustainable and peaceful democratic
systems and is an effective conflict-prevention measure and the basis of a fruitful and
peaceful relation between peoples- Israel, which is a party to key human rights
instruments, and the Palestinian Authority have committed themselves to respecting human
rights and fundamental freedoms and the European Union calls upon them to live up to this
commitment. The European Union recognizes that both parties have legitimate security
concerns but these must be addressed with respect for human rights and within the
framework of the role of law. </p>

<p>The European Union reaffirms once more its position that the fourth Geneva Convention
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is fully applicable to the
Palestinian occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, and constitutes binding
international humanitarian law </p>

<p>&nbsp;The European Union welcomes the fact that the High Commissioner visited the
region in November. It shares concerns expressed by the High Commissioner in her balanced
report, which it has taken duly into account in its deliberations. </p>

<p>The European Union welcomes the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of
human rights in the occupied territories. The European Union continues to believe&nbsp;
that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur should be brought in line with other
&nbsp;special mechanisms created by the Commission on Human Rights, notably to make it
subject to regular renewal by the Commission. Nevertheless, the European Union regrets the
failure of the Israeli Government to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur, as well as
other relevant thematic rapporteurs and it calls on Israel to do so. </p>

<p>Although the European Union did not support the resolution adopted at the Special
Session on Palestine last October, which established the Human Rights Inquiry Commission,
it has followed developments in relation to the Commission closely and has taken account
of its analysis and findings.</p>

<p>The European Union condemns the disproportionate and indiscriminate recourse to force
which cannot but aggravate the situation, increase an already high death toll -which
includes many children - and make peace an even more distant perspective. The European
Union urges Israel to make every effort to ensure that its security forces observe
international standards regarding the use of force.</p>

<p>The European Union strongly deplores the practice of extra-judicial killings of certain
Palestinians carried out by the Israeli Security Forces. Extra-judicial killings are not
only illegal and a violation of human rights norms but also damaging for the relationship
between the parties and are therefore obstacles to peace. The European Union reiterates
its call on the Israeli authorities to immediately halt the declared practice.
Extra-judicial executions are unacceptable for any legal state system, which claims to
have as its basis the rule of law. </p>

<p>The closures of and within the Palestinian territories has had disproportionate and
detrimental effects on the lives of many Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem. These closures have disrupted basic public services for the Palestinians
and infringed on their right to freedom of movement and access to holy places. In some
instances they have led to the loss of life. While understanding the Israeli security
concerns the European Union calls upon the Israeli Government to immediately put an end to
the practice of closures and restates that collective punishments are prohibited under
international law. The European Union considers </p>

<p>&nbsp; that the closures contribute together with other factors to the unrest and
violence that have been prevailing in the zone for several months. The closures have also
seriously hampered humanitarian aid workers providing assistance to the Palestinian
people. A total closure of the occupied territories constitutes a clear breach of
international humanitarian law. The European Union reiterates that it is the duty of the
Israeli Government to safeguard the food and medical supplies of the population in the
occupied Arab territories. One of the basic humanitarian principles is that of free access
of humanitarian goods and personnel. As long as the speedy and safe delivery of
humanitarian assistance is not guaranteed, that principle is violated. In accordance with
international law, Israel must allow and facilitate access for humanitarian personnel and
goods to the Palestinian territories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The closures have further led to serious economic, social and administrative
effects on the Palestinian people and undermine an already fragile economy. All economic
indicators have sharply decreased, reducing the Palestinian economy by half. Unemployment
has risen and one third of the Palestinian population is currently living under conditions
considered to be below the poverty line. This situation also jeopardizes efforts of
cooperation deployed by the international community to guarantee the viability of the
Palestinian Authority and the future Palestinian State and consequently the prospects of
the peace process. As previously reported by Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations
Coordinator for the middle East Peace Process and the Secretary-General's Personal
Representative to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestine Authority, the
Palestinian Authority suffers a fiscal crisis, soon not being able to pay its salaries
which might cause the collapse of key Palestinian institutions and lead to chaos and
anarchy. The European Union is deeply alarmed by these reports and the seriousness of the
economic and social situation and calls upon Israel to end immediately with the
withholding of due revenue payments to the Palestinian Authority </p>

<p>&nbsp;The European Union is deeply troubled by the negative impact the confrontations
are having on children. Children and youth on both sides have been direct victims of
violence resulting in deaths and injuries as well as long term psychological
impacts.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The violence has also had grave consequences for children affected by the practice of
closures, in particular those who are poor. The closures infringe their right to movement,
health and education. The European Union urges all parties to ensure that children have
access to health care and education.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The European Union is also troubled by what appears to be a discrepancy in Israeli
case-law as well as cases of the discriminatory application of laws to Israeli and
Palestinians. The European Union reiterates the need for all democratic legal systems to
adhere to the human right and fundamental legal principle of all persons' equality before
the law. The European Union calls upon the Israeli Government to repeal all discriminatory
taws and ensure the equal and non-discriminatory enforcement of the law by the Israeli
administration and courts </p>

<p>Furthermore&nbsp; the European Union continues to strongly oppose Israeli settlement
activities in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem, such as the construction
of new settlements and the expansion of already existing ones, the expropriation of land,
the biased administration of water resources, the construction of roads, and house
demolitions, all of which violate human rights and international humanitarian law, besides
being major obstacles to peace. The European union calls upon the Israeli Security Forces
to ensure the protection of the population in the occupied territories, including
preventing, investigating and prosecuting acts of violence committed by Israeli
settlers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;The European Union welcomed the release of persons kept under so-called
administrative detention last spring. The European Union however remains concerned over
the large number of persons, including children, who have been detained during the past
months, and the continued detention of some detainees without any criminal charges having
been brought against them. The European Union condemns the continued imprisonment of
several Lebanese citizens, who were arrested in the then occupied area and transferred to
Israel. This is a violation of the fourth Geneva Convention. The European Union urges the
Israeli Government to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the two
Lebanese citizens still being kept without charge. </p>

<p>The human rights situation under the Palestinian Authority continues to be a matter of
concern for the European Union. Reports of torture and deaths in custody, impunity, cases
of detention without trial, the arbitrary arrest of, for example, political prisoners and
the misuse of the State Security Courts are especially worrisome. The European Union calls
upon The Palestinian Authority to actively combat such activities, to bring those
responsible to justice and to ensure respect for the rule of law.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In this respect, it is worth mentioning the training program run by the European Union
and its Member States since 1997 to help the Palestinian Authority develop its expertise
in preventing and countering terrorist acts in accordance with international law and with
respect for agreed international standards on human rights and freedoms </p>

<p>&nbsp;The European Union remains particularly concerned over executions following death
sentences pronounced at sun1mary trials with apparent disrespect for the human rights of
the accused. It has called on the Palestinian Authority not to carry out death sentences.
The European Union remains concerned about the summary trials proceeding such sentences.
It strongly appeals to the Palestinian Authority to reinstate moratorium on the death
penalty and ensure that all trials follow due process of law and international minimum
safeguards </p>

<p>The right to freedom of expression and assembly is the foundation of any democratic
political system. The European Union is troubled by the Palestinian Authority imprisoning
persons exercising these rights without trial. It urges the Palestinian Authority to
immediately release all political prisoners detained after peaceful exercise of their
civil and political rights. Other important features of a viable democratic political
system are good governance and free and fair elections. Sustainable democracies are based
on transparent and accountable institutions and respect and promotion of human rights.
They are characterized by inclusive and consultative political process aiming at the
realization of equal rights and value of all citizens. The European Union also emphasizes
the role of the media to ensure an accurate reporting of local events. </p>

<p>&nbsp;The European Union continues to be firmly committed to assisting the Palestinian
Authority in strengthening public institutions in service of democracy based on respect
for human rights and fundamental freedoms, good governance and rule of law.</p>

<p>In the period between 1994 and 2000,&nbsp; the European Union contributed a total of
almost 3 billion EURO to the Palestinian people in the fields of education, human rights,
health, institution building, water, infrastructure, and environment. In 2000,&nbsp; the
European Union and its Member States contributed some 160 million EURO to UNRWA, including
emergency aid (of 15 million EURO) provided&nbsp; in December 2000. We also supply funds
to Palestinian, Israeli and joint Palestinian non-governmental organizations engaged in
promoting understanding and equality of rights through&nbsp; human rights and civil rights
education projects.</p>

<p>Given the recent economic crises in the Palestinian territories, cased in part by the
Israeli punitive measures,&nbsp; the European Union has provided the Palestinian Authority
with cash facilities, which helped ease the economic effects of Israel's decision not to
transfer VAT revenues. During the autumn of last year,&nbsp; the European Union paid 27.5
million EURO to that end. In December it extended this cash facility and set aside another
90 million EURO, of which 30 million EURO was paid in January 2001. The Union assumes that
further support will be needed in this regard and would welcome joint efforts by donors,
particularly regarding direct budget support.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The European Union also wants to draw the attention to the need to respect and
safeguard the human rights of persons living in the Syrian Golan Heights and expresses its
support for a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria.</p>
