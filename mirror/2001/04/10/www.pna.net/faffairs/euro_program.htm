programme of assistance to the West Bank&nbsp; and Gaza Strip </font></strong></p>

<p align="left">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; 1.1 The Mandate </p>

<p align="left">The mandate &#150; Evaluation of the European Community&#146;s Programme
of Assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip</p>

<p align="left">The general objective of the evaluation is to improve the impact and
efficiency of the programme of assistance to the Palestinians. The specific objective is
to emphasise strong and weak points in the implementation of projects under B7-420 and to
establish the relevance of the intervention strategy.</p>

<p align="left">The study is divided into two general levels :</p>

<p align="left">* Strategic analysis&nbsp;: the study should take into account the
political situation and obstacles faced in the implementation of the programme.</p>

<p align="left">* Operational analysis with evaluation of concrete projects in four
sectors&nbsp;: Private sector, Infrastructure and Construction, Education and Institution
Building.</p>

<p align="left">The evaluation team was composed of four members&nbsp;: a senior economist
(team leader), an architect, an education specialist and a junior economist. </p>

<p align="left">The mission was carried out in two steps: (1) July 1998, a week-long desk
study in Brussels and the completion of the Inception Report, (2) the field evaluation
from 20th August to the end of September 1998. </p>

<h3 align="left">1.2 Aid Strategy and Needs</h3>

<p align="left">For the last few years, the economic and social situation of the
Palestinian territories has been declining.</p>

<p align="left">* During the period 1992-96 the real GNP per capita has decreased by over
38.8 %.</p>

<p align="left">* Exports have fallen from US$ 1,295 million in 1992 to US$ 631 million in
1996 (a 51 % decrease( 1) ) mainly due to the reduction in labour exports. The number of
Palestinians working in Israel has dropped from 83,000 in 1993 (about 21% of the
Palestinian workforce) to 25,000 in 1996.</p>

<p align="left">* The Palestinian workforce was estimated in 1996 to be at 548,000 or 20 %
of the population. Unemployment rates range from 17 to 34 % and are highly affected by
closures.</p>

<p align="left">* The deteriorating level of investments in Palestinian territories,
especially in the industrial sector, severely limits the number of jobs available. As
substantial numbers of graduates enter the labour force every year, this results in high
levels of disguised employment and under-employment.</p>

<p align="left">* From 1996 to 1997, there were substantial variations in real daily wage
declines, with workers sustaining losses of 15.7 % in Gaza, 9.6 % in the West Bank and
those working in Israel 4.4 %. Real daily wages in Israel were, on average, 81.9 % above
those in the West Bank and 124 % higher than those in the Gaza Strip.<br>
</p>

<p align="left">International assistance to the Palestinian people has been a supportive
and necessary component during the transitional period 1993-1997. </p>

<p align="left">The aim of this assistance is to support the Palestinian Authority and to
finance the building of the economy and society in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

    <p>The Palestinian Authority faces many challenges and obstacles that hinder development
    and progress in the Palestinian Territories. These obstacles and challenges have a
    damaging impact on the economy by stifling private investment. </p>
    <p>* High incidence of border closures: the total number of days of imposed closure during
    the last 4 years was 342 days in the Gaza strip and 291 days in the West Bank; 1996 had
    the highest recorded number of days of closure to date. The total economic losses due to
    the closures for the period 1993-96 are estimated at about US$ 2.8 billion which is close
    to the GNP for a whole year and is also close to double the amount of aid received from
    donor countries within that period; losses can reach US$ 8-10 million per day.</p>
    <p>* Safe-passage for the free movement of Palestinians and goods between the West Bank
    and Gaza Strip has still to be implemented.</p>
    <p>* Airport and seaport allowing Palestinians to operate: construction of an airport( 4 4
    / Palestinian Airport was opened in December 1998) and a seaport has still to be allowed.</p>
    <p>* Restrictions on imports and exports: The limitations on the movements of goods to and
    from Palestinian Territories and those under Palestinian control create a significant
    burden on the Palestinian economy.</p>
    <p>* Increase in unemployment, deteriorated state of infrastructure, lack of natural
    resources and limits of new administration. </p>
    <p><br>
    The national priorities for development as indicated in the Palestinian Development Plan
    1998-2000 (December 1997) are the following:</p>
    <p>* Infrastructure Development</p>
    <p>* Institution Capacity-Building</p>
    <p>* Social and Human Resource Development</p>
    <p>* Economic Sector Development : private sector growth, agriculture, tourism, and
    facilitation and provision of soft loans for the private sector.</p>
    <p>The main objectives followed by the EU financed projects correspond entirely to the
    needs for economic development of the Palestinian territories and to government decisions.</p>
    <p>EU financing is very important, not only in absolute but also in relative terms. The
    scope of the EU&#146;s economic effort is particularly striking when we examine the
    comparison between the Total Budget Aid 1991-1995 calculated per capita and the economic
    assistance provided to other regions of the world in the area of the Lomé Conventions and
    Mediterranean( 5) :</p>

    The European assistance programme comprises 39 projects for the years 1994 to 1997.
    Amongst these projects four branches are significantly covered :</p>
    <p>* Construction and infrastructure projects</p>
    <p>* Assistance to the education sector</p>
    <p>* Private sector financing</p>
    <p>* Institutional building</p>
    <p>However, the evaluation underlines that the positive assessment regarding the overall
    relevance of the projects is purely subjective. If we consider the economic evolution
    between 1994 and 1998 (main economic indicators, GNP per capita, employment, exports
    &#133; evolved negatively) we could conclude that the financing did not influence the
    Palestinian economic situation. Unfortunately, financing (although the banks can provide
    it) cannot be the only solution to promote economic development.</p>
    <p>The main real obstacle to this development results from the lack of a safe-passage for
    the free movement of Palestinians and goods. We are in a situation of an abuse of
    prevailing economic standing. Since the West Bank and Gaza Strip enjoy no direct transport
    and communication with the world at large, other than through Israel or subject to Israeli
    control, the consequence is an enormous structural dependence of the Palestinian economy
    on Israel and vulnerability to Israeli Policy.</p>
    <p>Indeed, whatever the importance, the amount and the nature of financing, it is
    uncertain whether this will ensure effective economic development as long as the
    Palestinian economy remains under Israeli control.</p>

<h3 align="center">1.3 The European Assistance Programme</h3>

<p align="center">General remarks on the evaluation of this programme </p>

<p align="left">* The present situation of the Palestinian Territories is complex: it is a
transitory situation from a state of war and revolution, under long and varied foreign
rule, towards a state of peace and the rule of law. Since this evaluation took place
during this transitory situation, it was considered necessary to carry out a brief
sectoral analysis of the main environmental factors.</p>

<p align="left">* It should be noted that the operations to be evaluated are of a quite
varied nature: the financial contributions in the area of construction and infrastructure
and in the education sector are in fact budget supports. Using a banking expression, we
could call this short-term financing. Financial support to the private sector should be
considered as a loan because the final beneficiaries will have to reimburse the sum. We
could call this medium-term financing which is put in place in anticipation of the
creation of a development bank that will be able to raise its own funds. As regards
financial support for institution building, particularly so if we include the coming into
existence of a democracy we would like to call this very long-term financing.</p>

<p align="left">* The evaluation indicators are different for the various sectors. In the
case of the private sector, the evaluation should be based on precise data and on the
tendencies over time of each of these indicators. In contrast, the evaluation criteria for
institution building are bound to be more of a qualitative nature and subject to personal
judgements, which does not imply a lower quality of the criteria. Concerning the other two
sectors, evaluation indicators relate mostly to implementation results.</p>

<p align="center">* As a result, the assessments and conclusions presented are based on
sectoral analysis, that are presented in more detail in Chapter 4. The latter contains
also a larger number of sector-specific recommendations. <br>
</p>
</div><div align="center">

<h3 align="center">1.3.1 THE PRIVATE SECTOR</h3>

<p align="center">Status of the programme</p>

<p align="left">Until 1967, 32 branches of banks were operating in the West Bank and 6 in
the Gaza Strip. Afterwards, all the banks were closed by Israeli Military Orders. For 20
years, agencies from the four Israeli banks set up a kind of banking system for
Palestinians but those agencies had to close because of the Intifada and the boycott
launched by Palestinian people. </p>

<p align="left">During the period from 1967 up to 1991, credit agencies, and in particular
development institutions were developed. These were usually non-profit companies such as
NGOs, whose aim was to provide loans at low rates for local development projects. Foreign
donors, Arab and western countries, associations of the Palestinian Diaspora and, in
particular, the European Union financed these institutions. </p>

<p align="left">The European Union is the main donor of three credit agencies : ADCC, EDG
and TDC. Within the framework of this financial and technical assistance, these three
credit agencies were merged in 1996 to form the Palestinian Development Fund. The PDF has
a light and decentralised organisational structure with 42 employees. Financing decisions
are taken locally and reasonably rapidly.</p>

<p align="left">From 1987 to date, European Union financing reached US$ 34 million ( 6) .
One of the PDF&#146;s main objectives is the improvement of the portfolio in order to
reach its ultimate objective which is the creation of the first Palestinian development
bank, the Palestinian Banking Corporation.</p>

<p align="left">Evaluation.</p>

<p align="left">The results since 1987 demonstrate a striking improvement of performances:
</p>

<p align="left">* This financing has permitted investment in 2,095 companies. The
financing represents a total amount of US$ 50 million of credits for total investment
amount of US$ 162 million.</p>

<p align="left">* This also represents the creation of 2,600 jobs in companies whose total
employment is now 7,900.</p>

<p align="left">* Mainly medium sized companies, whose average market value is US$ 24,000
and who employ an average of 3.8 persons, were financed.</p>

<p align="left">* The credit recovery rate has risen from 66% to 95%.</p>

<p align="left">* The investment leverage effect has risen from 55% to 78%.</p>

<p align="left">* The employment leverage effect has risen from 1.1 to 2.8 for the same
unit costs.</p>

<p align="left">The improvement of the portfolio puts PDF in the position of reaching the
ultimate objective which, is the creation of a development bank. However, aspects of the
technical, legal and economic situation have to be considered:</p>

<p align="left">* The average duration of granted credits is still 2.74 years, this is
well below the period needed to support an investment.</p>

<p align="left">* PDF lacks liquid assets. In September 1998, PDF granted US$ 6 million in
credits, which it was unable to finance. With the monthly recovery of credits totalling
US$ 600,000, the customers would have waited ten months. It is, therefore, impossible for
PDF to move ahead, either through increasing its portfolio or prolonging the credits.</p>

<p align="left">* PDF lacks a Studies Department (economic feasibility, sectoral and
overall economic situation studies).</p>

<p align="left">* PDF has requested Development Bank status from the Palestinian Monetary
Authority. This should be approved quite rapidly and the PDF will become the Palestinian
Banking Corporation (PBC).</p>

<p align="left">*PBC&#146;s capital will increase from US$ 67,000 to US$ 27 million, by
incorporating the EU&#146;s financing. This capital will be owned by Euro-Palestinian
Foundation Limited, a Cyprus offshore charity set up for the benefit of the Palestinian
people. A board of appointed trustees comprising 5 Palestinians and 3 non-Palestinians
will manage this charity. All this should happen before the end of 1998.</p>

<p align="left">Recommendations. </p>

<p align="left">The ascertained evolution of this financing constitutes a model case which
could be recommended in identical circumstances and reproduced in the following three
large steps:</p>

<p align="left">* From 1987 to 1996, NGOs were financed. At the time there was no other
solution. Taking into account the prevailing political context, this financing was risky
and the credit recovery rate was only 66%. No bank would have taken these risks and it is
fortunate that the EU did this in the shape of a revolving fund.</p>

<p align="left">* 1996 to 1998 marked a stabilisation phase. The set-up of the PDF &#150;
which, lacking other possibilities adopted a business company status &#150; permitted the
adjustment of the portfolio and the structuring of a financing company.</p>

<p align="left">* This operation is now entering its third phase which is the setting up
of a Development Bank. This further step stands a good chance of success, especially if
the recommended action is taken.</p>

<p align="left">Considering the different particular phases faced by this project and in
comparison with other financing projects to the private sector we have studied, we may
conclude that the appropriateness, the relevance, the efficiency, the effectiveness and
the impact of the project has been optimum and it is possible to forecast its
sustainability with legitimate optimism.</p>

<h3 align="left">1.3.2 INFRASTRUCTURE &amp; CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p align="left">Status of the programme</p>

<p align="left">The construction and infrastructure projects form approximately 40 % of
the total amount of aid financed by the EU from 1994 to 1998. The projects under
evaluation through the present exercise cover a significant range of infrastructure
categories for as much as 85 % of the total amount allocated for the sector.</p>

<p align="left">The state of implementation of the evaluated projects is as follows:</p>

<p align="left">* The Municipal Support Programme (MSP) 1 &amp; 2 (25,000,000 ECU)</p>

<p align="left">The programme started in 1995 with a 10 million ECU budget, to which a
second phase of 15 million ECU was added. The implementing agency awarded more than 30
contracts for various works in seven selected towns. The programme will come to an end in
December 1998, as initially planned.</p>

<p align="left">* The Municipal Support Programme (MSP) 3 (20,000,000 ECU)</p>

<p align="left">Started in 1996 with a tentative list of the projects and an
identification mission, at the moment of the evaluation, in September &#145;98, the FA was
ready for signature.</p>

<p align="left">MSP 3 is following a similar approach to MSP 1 &amp; 2 and is therefore
likely to show the same strengthens and weaknesses.</p>

<p align="left">* The Ministry of Education Programme (14,000,000 ECU)</p>

<p align="left">Started in 1996 with the signature of the financial agreement, a first
package of 7 out of 22 planned schools was launched in June 1998.</p>

<p align="left">The construction work in progress is at more or less 30%.</p>

<p align="left">* The Temporary Seat Building (5,000,000 ECU)</p>

<p align="left">The project started in 1995 as a part of the MSP 1&amp;2, with a budget of
500.000 ECU.</p>

<p align="left">In September 1998 the financial agreement was ready for signature
providing a 5 million ECU budget and a draft architectural design.</p>

<p align="left">* The Gaza Solid Waste (7,085,000 ECU)</p>

<p align="left">The project started in 1993 with the identification and formulation of the
project by the European consultant. In 1995 the financial agreement between the EC and the
Mayor of the Gaza City Municipality was signed.</p>

<p align="left">In September 1998 the programme was completed within the contractual
period of time.</p>

<p align="left">Evaluation</p>

<p align="left">In 1995, the EU assistance for the sector started from the Project
Identification Report (PIR) which stated that aid should concentrate on municipal roads,
water supply, municipal buildings and possible solid waste and be implemented through the
municipalities and by the use of local contractors.</p>

<p align="left">Projects have achieved to provide the beneficiary population with some of
those identified infrastructures, as well as additional infrastructures not included in
the original list drawn up by the PIR.</p>

<p align="left">The evaluation mission stresses basic concerns that directly affected the
effectiveness of the projects:</p>

<p align="left">* The consultant had to carry out additional project identification,
detail design and works management to perform the expected high expenditure capacity.</p>

<p align="left">* Higher tribute should have been paid to the training component.</p>

<p align="left">* Time consuming payment procedures brought unexpected negative results to
the weak local economy.</p>

<p align="left">* Co-ordination between European Member States, the EC and other major
donors seems to be too limited.</p>

<p align="left">The specific context compelling immediate action is reported to be among
the causes of the lack of territorial and urban planning, therefore affecting the general
coherence between the real needs of the target populations and the infrastructure projects
carried out.</p>

<p align="left">The timing and the procedures of the works affecting the efficiency of the
implementation are tightly linked to the free circulation of persons and goods, which are
outside the control of both the donor and the recipient.</p>

<p align="left">Recommendations</p>

<p align="left">A preparatory interdisciplinary identification &amp; planning exercise
should be considered as essential to the suitability of the aid.</p>

<p align="left">EC-Headquarters should foster a clear division and autonomy of the roles,
whilst tight co-ordination and reciprocal control should permanently be carried out and
should agree on precise procedures both in the beneficiary country and in Europe, and make
clear rules well known to all the main actors.</p>

<p align="left">A specific support to donor co-ordination should be incorporated into the
programme, with the view of creating synergies for co-operation and co-ordination. </p>

<p align="left">Training and education to public works management and to environmentally
friendly design and actions ought to be given major consideration. </p>

<p align="left">The final design of each and other infrastructure should favourably look
at the concept of the new durable energetic balance for the life expectancy of it. </p>

<p align="left">The EU, whilst taking the decision to finance such visible projects, ought
to provide an example of top quality of a wisely appropriate application of clean
technology, promoting the vanguard of new environmentally friendly technology.</p>

1.3.3 EDUCATION</h3>

<p align="left">Status of the Programme.</p>

<p align="left">Education is the largest sector run by the Palestinian Authority and
caters to the educational and employment needs of an estimated 35% of the total
population. The EU support for Palestinian self-determination, formally elaborated in 1980
and reiterated on many subsequent occasions, has been expressed inter alia through the
provision of assistance to the education sector at all levels, but primarily to the
tertian education sector, to which it has been the sole donor.</p>

<p align="left">The higher education sector is composed of 8 universities which grant a
Bachelors degree or above; and 16 community colleges which offer 2 year diploma courses,
largely in commercial or technical fields.</p>

<p align="left">The universities are young institutions, all of them having been
established since the 1970s, and tend to have strong regional identities. Several of them
retain close associations with their original founding family. In the 1995/96 academic
year, 37,094 students registered. Approximately 42.8% of these were female. The ratio of
students to teachers ranges from 10 to 49 students.</p>

<p align="left">From 1978 to 1994 this sector was managed by the Council for Higher
Education (CHE). In 1994 with the establishment of the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education, the management of the Community Colleges was transferred to the Ministry&#146;s
Directorate of Technical Education and Community Colleges. In mid-1996 the entire sector
came under the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE).</p>

<p align="left">Universities are financed from three main sources: tuition fees; funds
which come to them through the MOHE and miscellaneous donations and contributions. Until
the Gulf War, 1990/91, approximately 75% of the financing came from the Gulf States, and
less than 10% from student fees. During the Intifada, as no student fees were paid, the
universities depended totally on PLO subsidies.</p>

<p align="left">Evaluation</p>

<p align="left">In 1993 the EC agreed to support, on an exceptional basis, recurrent costs
of the tertiary education sector. Prior to the Gulf War (1990/91) funds were available
from the Arab States, especially Kuwait, through the PLO, for the operating costs of the
Higher Education Sector. EC assistance was provided on the understanding that these costs
would in future be inscribed in the national budget, and that reforms would take place
progressively within the sector. The period 1994-1998 has seen progressive diminution of
funding for this purpose, both in terms of total allocations, and numbers of institutions
supported. The allocation of 4 MECU in 1998 for this purpose represents the final
allocation for recurrent costs to universities. This time period has also witnessed
parallel efforts to enhance not only cost-efficiency and tighter financial planning in
this sector, but also to encourage rationalisation of tertiary education overall. Whilst
this assistance is understood as an exceptional response to an emergency situation, its
importance in maintaining an important element in the fabric of Palestinian society cannot
be over-estimated. The EC also provided assistance to recurrent costs for basic and
secondary education in 1996/97; for school construction, libraries and laboratory
equipment for universities.<br>
</p>

<p align="left">Prior to the Gulf War in 1991 the West Bank and Gaza Strip experienced
steady economic growth. The Gulf War resulted in prolonged border closure and expulsion of
Palestinians from the Gulf States with consequent decline in remittances. This war also
resulted in the loss of grants from Arab States through the PLO, including grants for
Higher Education which amounted to US$150 million in 1989. The EC agreed, on an
exceptional basis, to support the running costs and employee salaries of institutions
dependent on the CHE for one year in order to allow these institutions to continue routine
academic activities, to prevent further strikes, and to allow Palestinians to establish a
sound educational administration dealing with respect to running costs on an annual rather
monthly basis.<br>
</p>

<p align="left">In 1993 the EU agreed to provide 15 MECU to finance salaries to
universities and some community colleges for 1994 through the CHE. Without this support it
appears that the sector would have collapsed.</p>

<p align="left">In early 1995 member states agreed that this support should continue at a
similar level, on condition that the recommendations of the EC-financed EFFECT report
would inform and guide future activities.</p>

<p align="left">Recommendations</p>

<p align="left">In mid 1995 the CHE was advised that EC support for the recurrent costs of
tertiary education would be reduced progressively from 15 MECU in 1995 to zero in 1999. At
the same time the Commission would consider providing investments during that period to
other activities such as libraries &amp; equipment for laboratories.</p>

<p align="left">Whilst it is certainly evident that the larger political and economic
environment has not materially improved, and therefore that the premise of budgetary
self-sufficiency which was a condition for this assistance has not materialised, there are
many indications that the tertiary education sector is being taken more seriously by the
PA and that some reforms have been implemented. In the Budget for 1998 which is pending
approval, US$ 9 million has been allocated for recurrent costs of the tertiary education
sector (as noted earlier the EC has committed 4 MECU for continued salary support in
1998). In principle this allocation of US$ 9 million will also be inscribed in future
Budgets of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p align="left">In terms of internal reform of this sector, which was also a condition of
continuing assistance, it seems that considerable progress has been made although much
needs to be done. The achievements can be summarised as follows:</p>

<p align="left">* a unified fee structure has been developed for implementation by all
universities</p>

<p align="left">* a unified salary scale has also been developed and adopted by
universities</p>

<p align="left">* a Law of Higher Education has been drafted by the MOHE and is pending
signature by President Arafat</p>

<p align="left"><br>
This law inter alia would help the MOHE to eliminate duplication between universities and
to maximise programmes with societal relevance by providing financial support to only
those universities/programmes it approves and accredits: some universities have
experimented with providing loans to needy students, instead of grants. It should be noted
that tuition fees were raised in 1997 and it could be argued that they could be raised
further for the less needy students.</p>

<p align="left">It is recommended, therefore, that the EC should, as soon as possible,
consider giving a positive response to the request from the MOHE (see Letter and proposal
Ref: MHE/901/4/2360 of 25/5/98 from Minister of Higher Education to EC Delegation
Jerusalem) to support the development of an Action Plan for the Assessment of Academic
Programmes, which grew out of the recommendations of the Rationalisation Plan supported by
the EC in 1997.</p>

<p align="left">The objective of this exercise would be to generate a series of
recommendations on specific rationalisation measures, e.g. consolidation of/or
cancellation of existing programmes and the establishment of new programmes; the
cost-effectiveness, relevance, scientific quality and viability of existing programmes; to
develop this evaluative capacity within institutions, and within the MOHE whose
co-ordinating function must be strengthened.</p>

<p align="left">It is recommended that support to recurrent costs of the Higher Education
System beyond 1998 be considered only after the Analysis recommended above has been
completed. Without pre-empting the findings of this report it is envisaged that any future
EC assistance to this sector would be conditional on:</p>

<p align="left">(a) the P.A. initially providing matching funds, which would be increased
as the EC assistance phased out progressively on a specific time-scale.</p>

<p align="left">(b) assistance being provided only to accredited programmes of
demonstrable quality and societal relevance.</p>

<p align="left">(c ) that the MOHE be strengthened inter alia by the filling of vacant
posts to play a strong co-ordinating and quality control role vis-a-vis institutions of
Higher Education.<br>

<h3 align="left">1.3.4 INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING</h3>

<p align="left">Status of the programme.</p>

<p align="left">Four projects are on-going, but three of them have not been implemented
(the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Institutional Capacity Building &#150; Ministry
of Finances &#150; and Râmallâh Radio). The fourth one (Technical Assistance on Customs
Administration) has not started yet.</p>

<p align="left">The Palestinian Legislative ( 3 MECU). For Phase I (1 MECU), the work done
by the consulting firm( 7) has not been appreciated. The predicted period ranges from
April 1998 to October 1999 with an amount of ECU 2 million. This Phase II will be carried
out by another consulting firm. To date, nothing has started except the approval of the
Terms of Reference by the parties.</p>

<p align="left">To date, the financial department of the European Commission is holding up
the contract with the new consulting firm. The European involvement is lacking when
compared with other donors. Due to the delays, the PLC was forced to turn to other donors
in order to protect the progress they have so far made towards the establishment of the
Council as an effective legislative body. This means that the US took over this central
relationship with the PLC. Presently, the project seems worthless and it would be urgent
to re-examine the programme shortly. This EU part of the project has reached a point of
collapse.</p>

<p align="left">The Institution Capacity Building (Ministry of Finances, 2 MECU). The
project consisted of the provision of technical assistance and administrative equipment
for the Ministries of Education, Housing, Health, Trade &amp; Economy, Post and
Telecommunications and Transport. The goal of the project was to enhance the
administrative capacities of the beneficiary institutions in order to provide the
Palestinian population with better administrative services. The supply of equipment had to
be made through local and international tender, grouping all equipment for the different
ministries. For this purpose the European Community selected an International Procurement
Consultant to supervise and monitor the tender process in 1996 and the implementation of
the entire programme.</p>

<p align="left">To date, the procurement of equipment has not commenced, while the
technical assistance project was entirely implemented for ECU 470,000. Regarding the
equipment programme, problems of timing and procedure have arisen and have until now
impeded the implementation of the programme.</p>

<p align="left">Râmallâh Radio (1.5 MECU). Some significant problems occurred, which
delayed the implementation of the project: The PBC is totally controlled by the
Palestinian Authority and there is a misunderstanding between PBC of the West Bank and PBC
of Gaza. The result that, due to its dependence on the PA, PBC is not allowed to enter the
private sector with its activities. According to the European Delegation, it is not worth
financing a corporation which practices censorship. That is against the European policy
regarding the freedom of expression and media and the support to such activity supposes
first that the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation is effectively independent.</p>

<p align="left">Evaluation. </p>

<p align="left">Though they correspond to the priority need to establish a sound legal and
regulatory framework, these three projects are currently frozen due to the different
problems of implementation and procedures. We can affirm that there has been no
effectiveness or impact, and occasionally a negative image of the EU action has been
reflected. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the EU should not follow its support to the
institution building.</p>

<p align="left">Indeed, these project ideas often emerged when the new Palestinian
Administration was created. The identified needs:</p>

<p align="left">* Have often not been the subject of a precise requirement expressed by
the Palestinian Authority but in some cases it was the donor who more or less made the
first move.</p>

<p align="left">* These needs, which over the years became more defined, have obviously
changed while the projects were in progress, which created some delays.</p>

<p align="left">* The Palestinian administrations under establishment were sometimes
unable to submit to procedural requirements of donors which appear complicated.</p>

<p align="left">* The result is that the overall assistance looks like a disparate and
scattered programme with intricate procedures.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
Recommendations. </p>

<p align="left">Today, after four years of experience, the needs seem to be better and
more accurately identified by the Palestinian Administration. Subsequently, we recommend
that:</p>

<p align="left"><br>
* Despite the difficulties, the commitments be respected and the projects under execution
implemented, even if the Terms of References and/or the initial objectives have to be
modified or re-defined and if the procedures have to be simplified.</p>

<p align="left">* New priorities be defined in co-ordination with the Palestinian
Administration, now capable of better defining their needs.</p>

<p align="left">* The new objectives should be targeted in accordance with priorities and
not spread among too many projects.</p>

<p align="left">* A certain number of significant principles, which have been defined by
the Palestinians, should be expressed through the projects:</p>

<p align="left">* Support to democracy be given. Indeed, we are faced with a transition
from a war society to a civil society. This particularly concerns the separation of powers
between the Legislative and the Executive.</p>

<p align="left">* Assistance be givento the definition of objectives and means to be
initiated by the Palestinians themselves.</p>

<p align="left">These entire actions may require more important means. Of course, these
should be led in co-ordination with other donors. These principles define three
significant fields of action, some of which are already registered within the current
projects but require either a new definition or a reinforcement of means. It regards:</p>

<p align="left">* Support to the Palestinian Legislative Council</p>

<p align="left">* Support to the Customs Administration</p>

<p align="left">* Support to the Ministry of Planning and International Co-operation<br>
</p>

<p align="left">In addition, we think that action should be taken in two areas, in order
to encourage the ongoing Institution Building:</p>

<p align="left">* Support to professional organisations and in particular to sectoral
professional associations. This concerns creating an economic power base which, if its
representativeness and its means allow it to function efficiently, could be the basis of
economic democracy. This could be an additional and powerful means to make things evolve.
We recommend an identification mission in order to determine the needs and the means to
promote this important field.</p>

<p align="left">* In the important field of institution building, the co-ordination
between the donors has to be perfect and action has to be taken jointly.</p>

<p align="left">There should not be any competition between donors in this important
domain, especially since this field is vast and the limits never reached. The donors
supplement each other more than they compete. This means putting together resources,
know-how and different cultural sensitivities.</p>
