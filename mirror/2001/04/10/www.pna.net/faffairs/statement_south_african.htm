<p><font color="#B80000"><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT ON SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL TEAM TO ASSIST
PALESTINIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>
</strong></font><br>
South Africa has consistently voiced its deep concern about the worsening humanitarian
situation in Palestine as a result of the ongoing violence and closure on Palestinian
towns and villages imposed by Israel. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 393
Palestinians have been killed since the outbreak of the violence on 29 September 2000 and
some 21,000 injured, stretching the meagre resources of the Ministry of Health to
capacity. Of the injured, thousands will suffer permanent disabilities.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Responding to an urgent need by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the South African
Islamic Medical Association has dispatched a team of medical practitioners who will arrive
in Palestine on 12 January, to work in Palestinian hospitals, as guests of the Palestinian
Ministry of Health. They will work alongside Palestinian doctors, performing surgery and
providing medical care to the sick and injured.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
The South African Government has previously made a donation to&nbsp; the Palestinian Red
Crescent Society, for the purchase of emergency medical supplies and gives its full
support to this praiseworthy initiative in people-to-people co-operation.&nbsp; <br>

ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS&nbsp; ON <br>
BEHALF OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, <br>
RAMALLAH&nbsp; <br>
