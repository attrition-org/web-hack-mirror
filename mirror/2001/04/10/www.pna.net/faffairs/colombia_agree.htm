<p>We reiterate the continued validity of the fundamental rights of all peoples to
self-determination exercise of which, in the case of peoples under colonial or alien

situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms We
strongly condemn ongoing brutal Suppression of the legitimate aspirations for
self-determination of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation in
various regions of the world</p>

<p>We reaffirm the Inalienable right of peoples or non-self-governing territories to
self-determination and independence in accordance with United Nations General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 regardless of the territory's size, geographical
location, population and limited natural resources. We renew our commitment to hasten the
complete elimination or colonialism, and support the effective implementation of the
&nbsp; Plan of Action of the Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. In this regard, we
propose the declaration of a new Decade for the elimination of Colonialism to commence in
2001. We reaffirm in this context that the principle of self-determination with respect to
the remaining territories within the framework of the Program or Action Should be
implemented . In accordance with the wishes of the people consistent with United Nations
&nbsp; General Assembly resolutions and the Charter or the United Nations. </p>

<p>In the context of the implementation of UNGA resolution 1514 (XV), we reiterate &nbsp;
that any attempt aim at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the I
territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles
of&nbsp; the Charter of the United Nations. We also reaffirm the right of all people that
have been Subjected to colonialism to receive full compensation for the human and material
losses they suffered as e result of colonialism foreign occupation and I alien domination </p>

General Assembly resolutions and the return or cultural property to their countries of
origin. They also affirmed the right of the Non-Aligned Countries to preserve their
cultures and protect their national heritage. which are the basis of the cultural identity
of these Countries. </p>

inter alia, requested the US Government, to order the halt of its armed forces military
drills and maneuvers of Vieques. Island and to withdraw from the occupied territory of

resolutions of the 10 Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly. We further

power such as its illegal decision of 14 December 1981 that purports to alter the legal
physical and demographic status of the occupied Syrian Golan and its institutional
structure as well as the Israeli measures to apply Its jurisdiction and administration
there, are null and void. We also reaffirm that all such measures and actions constitute a
flagrant&nbsp; violation of international taw. international conventions. the Charter and
decisions of the United Nations particularly Security Council resolution 497 (1981) the
Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the protection of civilians in time of war,

Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and withdraw fully from the occupied Syrian Golan,
to the lines of 4 June 1967, in implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 and
338. and that Israel adheres to the Madrid terms of reference based on the principle of
land for peace, which are in their entirety considered to be a primary and basic element
in the negotiation process that should be adhered to including the immediate commencement
of the demarcation of the 4 June, 1967 1ine. </p>

<p><big>Lebanon</big></p>

<p>while expressing our deep concern over the continued Israeli aggression&nbsp; against
Lebanon and the ensuing illegal detainment of Lebanese nationals loss of civilian lives

immediately, completely and unconditionally (from South Lebanon and the Western Bekaa to
the Internationally recognized boundaries in compliance with Security Council resolutions
425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and to fully and strictly respect the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and Political independence of Lebanon. We also maintain. that any conditions

legal and political structure and are hence unacceptable. </p>

<p>of the commitments and pledges made in accordance with the terms of reference of the
Madrid Conference and the ensuing negotiations. We reiterate the need to fully respect and
adhere to the September 2000 deadline set for the achievement of the final Settlement. In
this Context We believe that the United Nations Millennium 5Jrnmit should serve as a
additional and natural deadline In which Palestine should participate 89 a UN Member
State. We express our grave concern over the current state of affairs in the peace
process, particularly the recent disruption of this process on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks. In this regard, We consider the attempts by the Israeli, Government to change the
terms of reference of the peace process and create a new reality on the ground, as well as
its failure to give priority to the core questions. to be an obstacle On the way of

Conference end the principle of land for peace and Israeli full implementation of all
agreements, undertakings, and commitments reached by the concerned parties on all tracks
during the peace talks. We also affirm that the failure by the Israeli Government to
respond Positively would require the Non-Aligned Movement Members to take further
appropriate measures.<big> </big></p>
