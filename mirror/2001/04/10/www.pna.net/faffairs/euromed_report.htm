<p ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#B80000">COMMON STRATEGY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION<br>
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION</font></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the European Council at Santa Maria da Feira (Portugal) on 19-20 June
2000, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union adopted the following Common
Strategy on the Mediterranean Region:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, in particular Article 13
thereof,</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">HAS ADOPTED THIS COMMON STRATEGY:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">PART I</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">VISION OF THE EU FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The Mediterranean region is of strategic importance to the EU. A
prosperous, democratic, stable and secure region, with an open perspective towards Europe,
is in the best interests of the EU and Europe as a whole.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The Mediterranean region continues to be faced with political,
economic, judicial, ecological and social challenges. If these complex and diverse
challenges are to be overcome, the EU and the Mediterranean Partners must work together
with a common vision, sensitivity and mutual respect.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The EU's Mediterranean policy is guided by the principle of
partnership, a partnership which should be actively supported by both sides. The EU will
work with its Mediterranean Partners to: develop good neighbourly relations; improve
prosperity; eliminate poverty; promote and protect all human rights and fundamental
freedoms, democracy, good governance and the rule of law; promote cultural and religious
tolerance; and develop cooperation with civil society, including NGOs. It will do so by
supporting the efforts of the Mediterranean Partners to attain the goals set out by the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, by using its bilateral relations to pursue theses
objectives, and by contributing to the creation of a peaceful environment in the Middle
East.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. This Common Strategy builds on the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
established by the Barcelona Declaration and its subsequent acquis, the Berlin Declaration
and the European&nbsp;Union's long-standing policy towards the Mediterranean with its
bilateral and regional components.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. The EU is convinced that the successful conclusion of the Middle
East Peace Process on all its tracks, and the resolution of other conflicts in the region,
are important prerequisites for peace and stability in the Mediterranean. Given its
interests in the region and its close and long-standing ties with its constituent
countries, the Union aspires to play its full part in bringing about stability and
development in the Middle East. The cooperation that has already been initiated in the
framework of the Barcelona Process is a determining factor in laying the foundations for
after peace has been achieved. The Union will therefore support the efforts of the parties
to implement the peace agreements. In this regard the adoption of the Euro-Mediterranean
Charter for Peace and Stability, an objective which predates the adoption of this
strategy, should be a deciding factor in the post-conflict process in the Mediterranean. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Bearing in mind the vital importance of the Mediterranean region to
the EU, and with a view to further strengthening its Mediterranean dimension, the European
Council adopts this Common Strategy. It covers all the EU's relations with all its
partners in the Barcelona&nbsp;Process, and with Libya. But it does not include the EU's
bilateral relations with those Mediterranean countries which are candidates for EU
membership, since those relations are covered by the Accession Process. While the European
Union will continue to play its full role in the Middle East Peace Process according to
its acquis including the Berlin&nbsp;Declaration, this Common Strategy will cover the EU's
contribution to the consolidation of peace in the Middle East once a comprehensive peace
settlement has been achieved.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">PART II</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">OBJECTIVES</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. The European Union has the following goals in its policy towards the
Mediterranean region:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to make significant and measurable progress towards achieving the objectives of the
    Barcelona Declaration and its subsequent acquis, i.e.:</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- to establish a common area of peace and stability through a political
and security partnership,<br>
- to create an area of shared prosperity through an economic and financial partnership,<br>
- to establish a partnership in social, cultural and human affairs: developing human
resources, promoting understanding between cultures and exchanges between civil societies;</p>

<ul>
  <li>to promote the core values embraced by the EU and its Member States &#150; including
    human rights, democracy, good governance, transparency and the rule of law;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>to encourage and assist Mediterranean partners with the process of achieving free trade
    with the EU and among themselves in the terms of the Barcelona Declaration, economic
    transition and attracting increased investment to the region;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>to strengthen cooperation in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, as outlined by the
    Tampere European Council;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>to pursue, in order to fight intolerance, racism and xenophobia, the dialogue between
    cultures and civilisations.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8. As far as security matters are concerned, the EU intends to make use
of the evolving common European policy on security and defence to consider how to
strengthen, together with its Mediterranean Partners, cooperative security in the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9. The Union has already played an active role in the past in the
efforts to establish a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East and to
bring about stability and development in the region. It regards the cooperation that has
already been initiated in the framework of the Barcelona Process as a determining factor
in providing a foundation on which to build once peace has been achieved. Within the
framework of this common strategy, and taking its paragraph 6 into account, the European
Union sets itself as objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to promote conditions which will help the parties implement agreements concluded among
    themselves;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>to develop the basis for normal good-neighbourly relations and encourage the parties to
    engage in regional cooperation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>to contribute to the consolidation of peace in the region, including economic
    integration and mutual understanding between civil societies.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10. To increase the effectiveness, impact and visibility of EU actions
and initiatives in the region, the following general objectives will be pursued:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to enhance coordination, coherence and complementarity and ensure synergies between the
    different existing regional and subregional activities, instruments and interventions of
    the EU and its Member States;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>to ensure complementarity of the EU's Mediterranean policy with EU policies concerning
    other partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">PART III</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">AREAS OF ACTION AND SPECIFIC INITIATIVES</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11. The EU will, together with its Mediterranean Partners, undertake a
comprehensive review of the Barcelona Process with the aim of reinvigorating the Process
and making it more action-orientated and results-driven.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12. The European Union will endeavour to pursue the following specific
initiatives, without precluding possible new initiatives, which could, where appropriate,
take account of the specific situations and needs of the countries, regions or sub-regions
concerned. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Political and security</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13. The EU will strengthen the political and security-related dialogue
with its Mediterranean partners at all levels: bilaterally with individual Mediterranean
partners; in the Barcelona&nbsp;framework, including the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for
Peace and Stability after its entry into force; and in other multilateral contexts to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify common ground on security issues aiming at establishing a common area of peace
    and stability;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>elaborate partnership-building measures, notably by promoting regular consultations and
    exchanges of information with its Mediterranean Partners; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>provide timely and appropriate information on initiatives that could be of concern to
    other Mediterranean Partners;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>reinforce cooperation against global challenges to security, such as terrorism,
    organised crime and drug trafficking;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>cooperate on possible arrangements for conflict prevention, crisis management and
    post-conflict rehabilitation including the encouragement of the peaceful settlement of
    conflicts and disputes, including by judicial means;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>explore possibilities to address problems of anti-personnel landmines in the
    Mediterranean region through cooperation in mine action, including mine clearance, mine
    awareness and victim assistance, with a view to promoting the objectives of the Ottawa
    Convention;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>promote the signature and ratification by Mediterranean Partners of all
    non-proliferation instruments, including the NPT, CWC, BWC and CTBT;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>pursue a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of
    mass-destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems.</li>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this context, the EU will take into account further developments of
the Common European&nbsp;Security and Defence Policy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Democracy, Human Rights and the Rule of law</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14. In the framework of the Barcelona Process and in its bilateral
relations with Mediterranean&nbsp;Partners, the EU will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actively promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law, in
    particular through political dialogue and support for judicial reform, institution
    building, and freedom of expression, notably through the strengthening of the independent
    media;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>support and encourage efforts to promote good governance;</li>

    through human rights training, monitoring, advocacy and awareness-raising; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>in the context of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, urge
    accession to international human rights instruments including full implementation of
    civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights without distinction as to race,
    sex, language or religion;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>take measures to persuade all Mediterranean Partners to abolish the death penalty in
    accordance with agreed EU guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peace in the Middle East</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15. The EU will, taking paragraph 6 of this Common Strategy into
account,</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide its expertise, submit ideas and make available its good offices and assistance
    to the core parties of the Peace Process in order to facilitate the conclusion of peace
    agreements and help prepare the &quot;post peace era&quot; in the Middle East;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>actively promote progress on the multilateral track of the Peace Process drawing also on
    synergies with the Barcelona Process. With regard to central issues such as water and
    refugees, the EU will offer its expertise whenever requested;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>in the context of a comprehensive settlement, and upon request by the core parties, give
    consideration to the participation of Member States in the implementation of security
    arrangements on the ground ;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>contribute to the international commitment needed to implement and consolidate peace in
    the Middle East, notably through support to regional economic cooperation and integration
    and the expansion of trade flows;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>work towards strengthening stability in the Middle East by means of cooperative security
    through its contributions to the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for

<ul>
  <li>make every effort to speed up the conclusion and implementation of the remaining
    Association Agreements;</li>

    within a framework leading to wider regional cooperation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>encourage and support efforts by Mediterranean Partners to increase South-South trade,

    rules of origin;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assist Mediterranean Partners in strengthening their capacity to formulate appropriate
    trade policies and to participate actively in trade negotiations, in particular with
    regard to the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area and future
    negotiations in the WTO;</li>

    economic transition, sound fiscal and monetary policies and structural reform;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the Commission will ensure that other resources from the Community budget available to
    benefit the Mediterranean partners are used coherently. Improved coordination will be
    sought with other relevant EU programmes (Fifth R&amp;D Framework Programme confirming the
    international role of Community research with partners, SYNERGY, LIFE, INTERREG III).</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">19. The EU will promote better integrated water strategies and water

</ul>

<ul>

    practices, transfer of know how and capacity-building.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Justice and Home Affairs</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">22. Building on the acquis of the Barcelona Process and further to the

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>study the simplification and acceleration of visa issue procedures;</li>

<ul>
  <li>enter into dialogues with a view to setting up modern and effective border control
    systems, offering inter alia access to training programmes and exchanges of officials;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>work with Mediterranean Partners to address the question of migration, taking into full
    consideration the economic, social and cultural realities faced by Partner countries. Such
    an approach would require combating poverty, improving living conditions and job
    opportunities, preventing conflicts, consolidating democratic states and ensuring respect
    for Human Rights;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>develop a common approach to ensure the integration into society of Mediterranean
    partners&#146; nationals who have been lawfully resident in a Member State for a certain

  <li>exchange information and statistics with the Mediterranean partners on migration flows.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">23. The EU will develop further its cooperation with Mediterranean

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>offering collaboration with Mediterranean Partners to develop the necessary legal,

the UN&#146;s international conventions on terrorism, and to follow the principle that the
fight against terrorism must be firmly based on the principles of International Law and
the respect for Human Rights.</p>
