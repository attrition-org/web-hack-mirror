<p align="justify">The South African Government greatly appreciates and fully supports the
efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan aimed at defusing the
current grave and Volatile situation in the Middle East.</p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government believes that, if unchecked, the current
initiative of the United Nations Secretary General once again underlies the centrality of
the United Nations specially United Nations Secretary Council, as custodian of global
peace and security.</p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government believes that, if unchecked, the current
volatile and grave situation in the Middle East represents dire threat not just to peace
and security in the Middle East, but also t international peace and security in general.</p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government once again expresses its support for the
other initiatives currently underway in the Middle East to help defuse the grave
situation, whilst it still believes that all initiatives should have the effect of
underscoring the centrality of the United Nations in the maintenance of world peace and
security, including in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government continues to belive steadfastly that the
United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 1322 remain the international
legitimate basis for the establishment of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.</p>

<p align="justify">Once again the South African Government calls for the speedy
establishment of the international mechanisms of inquiry into the tragic events since 28
September 2000.</p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government calls on all the security forces,
including armed militias in the region, and in particular the Israeli Defense Force, to
act with responsibility and restraint so as not to further provoke and inflame the already
extremely volatile situation.</p>

<p align="justify">In particular the South African Government calls upon the Government of
Israel to put an end to the violence emanating from some of the extremist elements of the
Jewish settler community directed at both the Arab Israeli community and the Palestinians </p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government once again calls on the leaders in the
Middle East to avoid, in the interest of peace and security, taking actions and making
statements that only worsen the already grave and volatile situation in the Middle East.</p>

<p align="justify">The South African Government calls on all the parties in the Middle
East to redouble their efforts to create the necessary conditions for the resumption of
the Middle East Peace Process aimed in particular at the robust and speedy resolution of
the Final Status issues.</p>
