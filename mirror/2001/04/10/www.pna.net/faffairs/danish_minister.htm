<p>Yasser Abed Rabbo, Minister of Culture and Information expressed appreciation of the
statement made by Danish Foreign Minister Mogens Lyketoft, position published in
(Berlingkse Tidende) newspaper, in which he called on the EU to impose economic sanctions
against Israel because of its settlement policy.</p>

<p>Abed Rabbo pointed out that lykteoft statement is the normal stance that congruous with
the international law, and that stance must be adopted by EU and all the world
governments, in order to make the Israeli government understand that it can not continue
with its aggresson against the Palestinian people. </p>

<p>Danish Foreign Minster strongly criticized the settlements activity, which the new
government have started recently, and considered it a flagrant violation of the fourth
Geneva Convention, which would raise the tensions in the region.</p>

<p>It is worth menting, that Danish Foreign Minister, made similar comments last month in
an interview with Denmark&#146;s T.V chanel.2, in which he criticized the Israeli new
policy of expanding settlements in the occupied territories. Lyketoft also accused Sharon
and his followers of making it very difficult for Palestinian to create their own state. <br>
