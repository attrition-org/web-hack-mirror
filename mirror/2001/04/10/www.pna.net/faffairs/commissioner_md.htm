The Rt Hon Chris Patten <br>
Commissioner for External Relations <br>
SPEECH/01/43<br>
Contribution to a debate on the situation in the Middle East <br>
European Parliament <br>
Brussels, 31st January 2001<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for this opportunity to report to the House on the situation in the Middle
East.<br>
Matters are ­ once again - in a state of flux. As you know, the Palestinians and the
Israelis have just concluded in Taba, Egypt their latest round of negotiations on the four
key issues: <br>
territorial boundaries, security, Jerusalem and refugees.<br>
We understand that there was some limited progress on territory and security. Given the
circumstances and time constraints, both parties have announced that it was impossible to
reach an understanding on all issues. There will not be any further talks before the
Israeli elections on 6 February. We must, in any case, continue to support efforts to find
a peaceful solution for the conflict. This includes preserving the acquis from previous
peace talks, including Taba.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><br>
Israel is now going into an election: I am sufficiently experienced in these matters to
know that it would not be wise for me to speculate on the post election scenario before
the people of Israel have made their democratic will clear.But, like Hon Members, we are
all seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides. There has already been a
high number of victims caused by an excessive use of force and we are deeply worried about
the extra-judicial killings perpetrated by Israeli security forces; not only does this
undermine the prospects of achieving a negotiated settlement, it is also unacceptable for
a democratic nation to resort to such means, in grave violation of human rights and the
rule of law.<br>
But let me be equally clear: we are also deeply concerned by the killing of Israeli
civilians by Palestinians, and by the recent executions of Palestinians; this too is
unacceptable, especially so given the PA's earlier commitment to a moratorium on the death
penalty.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><br>
We remain concerned too at the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza. The
remaining closure by Israel is having devastating effects on the Palestinian economy, and
therefore on political stability. It is even affecting the import of humanitarian aid to
the Palestinian territories: for example, the Palestinian Authority has notified the
Commission's Representative in Jerusalem that the official inauguration (originally
foreseen for mid-January) of the Gaza Hospital has had to be postponed - until further
notice; the situation has deteriorated further and staff and patients are prevented now
from reaching the hospital. Likewise, equipment and supplies such as oxygen, medicines and
fuel cannot not reach the hospital, and further building work has had to be suspended. In
its preliminary implementation report following the December emergency appeal, UNRWA also
raises concern about serious difficulties in the delivery of food, construction material,
medical items and other essential supplies. The security of staff engaged in humanitarian
assistance has been severely compromised.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><br>
I regret that the situation has continued to deteriorate. We have, however, continued to
make our position absolutely crystal clear. We have demanded that the remaining closures
on the Palestinian economy should be lifted. We have asked for Israel to end immediately
the withholding of revenue payments due to the Palestinian Authority.<br>
<br>
And we have reacted promptly to the crisis by addressing both the humanitarian situation
and the precarious budgetary situation of the PA. In December the Commission provided Eur
15 m in emergency aid, Eur 14.5 m alone to UNRWA in response to its emergency appeal. In
addition, we disbursed a Eur 27.5 m Special Cash Facility in the belief that it was in the
interest of both sides not to undermine the Palestinian Authority's ability to pay
salaries. In the same spirit, the Commission set up the new Cash Facility of Eur 90 m. I
have disbursed a first tranche of Eur 30 million to the PA last week.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><br>
But we need to look at the likely situation for the rest of this year. As our resources
are limited we need to examine carefully how to proceed further. If we continue drawing
monthly payments from the Special Cash Facility, in order to meet the current
administrative needs of the Palestinian Authority, including payment of civil servants'
salaries, education, health and other public services, funds will run out soon. The PA is
now facing an ongoing fall in revenue and a rising deficit. They will need to adjust their
policies. Instead of just bailing out month to month we need to look at how to help over
the longer term.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><br>
Indeed, the EU and the wider international community have an interest in preserving the
economic and institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority, which we have helped to
create and fund. If the Palestinian Authority collapsed. It would be a severe blow to
prospects for peace in the region, Israeli security would be threatened and our efforts to
promote co- operation and stability in the Middle East will be undermined. That is why
both the Palestinian Authority and the international community at large must look beyond
the immediate crisis and considering how to deal with a steadily widening gap in
Palestinian finances.<br>
