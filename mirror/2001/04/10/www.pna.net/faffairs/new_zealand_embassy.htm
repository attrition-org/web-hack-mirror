Statement on Israeli Palestinian Crisis<br>
Goff on Israeli /Palestinian crisis</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">Foreign Minister Phil Goff today joined other representative of the
International community in appealing to Israelis and Palestinians to step back from the
brink of warfare that would be disastrous not only for their countries, but for their
whole region.</p>

<p align="left">&#147;The situation Israel and Palestine is deteriorating dangerously.
Each horrific act beamed instantly on television screens to both sides and round the
world, fuels deeper hatred and adds to a downward spiral of violence and revenge.</p>

<p align="left">&#147; The killing and mutilation of at least two captive Israeli soldiers
by a Palestinian mob and the retaliation by Israel with helicopter gunships attacking
targets near Mr. Arafat&#146;s offices, has taken the crisis to new levels.</p>

<p align="left">&#147;Today in the Middle the situation is the most serious it has been in
decade. It threatens to spill over into more acts of terrorism worldwide.</p>

<p align="left">&#147; New Zealand supports strongly the efforts of the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan&#146;s to call for Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak to engage
with each other and to do everything possible to restore calm.</p>

<p align="left">&#147;The futures of the Israelis and Palestinians are bound together.
This is an argument neither side can win by violence.&#148;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;The only last victory will be one brought about at the negotiating
table.&#148;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;New Zealand, of course, can be little on its own. But we can and
will lend our weight through the United Nations to the calls for peace.&#148;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;New Zealand is also giving $100,000 to the &#147;United Nations
Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine in the calls for peace.&#148;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;We continue to have a peacekeeping presence in the area, with 26
armed peacekeepers in Sinai and other 7 unarmed peacekeepers with the United Nations in
Israel and Syria.&#148;</p>
