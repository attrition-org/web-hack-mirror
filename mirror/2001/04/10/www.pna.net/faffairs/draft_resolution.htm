&quot;International Legitimacy&quot; as well as international Covenants and conventions
which consider all Israeli arrangements, legislative, administrative and colonial
settlement measures aiming at altering the legal demographic, architectural, cultural and
heritage-related status of the Holy City as null and void and contrary to the resolutions

exhorts them not to move their diplomatic missions to the city of Al-Quds. The resolution

lest it may be construed as an implicit, a de facto recognition of the fait accompli
imposed by Israel which claims that the City of Al-Quds is its capital. The states are
also requested to declare their rejection of the recommendation passed by the U.S. House
of Representatives and the American statements in favor of the recognition of Al-Quds as
the capital of Israel and of moving the American Embassy therein. The Summit CALLS for
severing relations with any State that would move its embassy to Al-Quds before the
proclamation of the Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital and the
achievement of just and overall pence in the area; </p>

<p>Calls for legal proceedings to challenge the soundness of the law passed by the
American House of Representatives on recognizing AI-Quds as the capital of Israel and
moving the American Embassy to it, on the ground that this law gives preference to a
religious group over another which is contrary to the constitution of the United States of
America based on equality among communities. Moreover, the land on which the would-be
embassy is to be built in the occupied City of Al-Quds is a stolen land originally
belonging to an Islamic &quot;waqf&quot; [Muslim trust-fund]; </p>

<p>Urges all states, institutions and international bodies to abide by the international
resolutions on the City of Al-Quds for its being part of the Palestinian and other Arab
territories occupied in 1967 and not to take pan in any meeting or activity made to serve
Israel's designs to consecrate its occupation of and annexing the Holy City; </p>

<p>Exhorts the international community, especially the two states co-sponsors of the peace
conference. to bring pressure to bear on Israel not to effect any geographic or
demographic alteration in the Holy City of Al-Quds, to refrain from any action or measure
of a nature as to affect the outcome of the negotiations on the definitive status of the
City, to honor the relevant international resolutions and decisions, to lift the siege of
the City of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, to ensure the liberty of worship therein along with the
religious shrines of all monotheistic religions, to stop the demolition of homes and the
withdrawal of the national identity cards of the Palestinian citizens as well as the
emptying of City of Al-Quds Al-Sharif from its Arab nationals. The summit also appeals to
the international community and the Security Council to carry out the Council's decisions
on the protection of the status of Al-Quds, including the implementation mechanisms of its
resolutions 1073 (1996) and 1322 (2000)7 by, inter alia, taking appropriate decisions and
measures in this respect, in accordance with the U.N. Charter, given the fact that what
Israel did in Al-Quds is considered a violation of international covenants, a threat to
international peace and and security and an act of aggression;</p>

<p>Strongly condemns the decisions of the Israeli &quot;Supreme Court&quot; on the city of
Al-Quds Al-Sharif, especially the one issued on July 25, 1996, granting Jews the
permission to pray in the praying area of the blessed Mosque of Al-Aqsa and the one dated
September 23, 1993, proclaiming Al-Aqsa Mosque as part of the area covered by the
&quot;State of Israel&quot; . The&nbsp; Conference considers such measures as deliberate
provocation acts opening the way to extremist Jewish organizations to pursue their
constant violations of the sanctity of the Holy Mosque of Al-Aqsa, establish a presence of
their in its praying areas and continue the looting of religious, historic and cultural
relics in the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the rest of the occupied Palestinian
territories;</p>

<p>Strongly condemns Israel for giving orders to close the Palestinian institutions in
Al-Quds Al-Sharif and preventing them from freely conducting their activities. It
considers such arbitrary coercive measures as a continuous violation of the accords signed
between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel within the framework of the
peace process and a flagrant violation, as well, of international conventions and
covenants, particularly the 4th Geneva Convention of 1949, and an infraction of the very
principles and foW1dntions on which the peace process was built in Madrid; </p>

<p>Pays a glowing tribute to the laudable efforts exerted by the late King Al-Hassan II to
set up the Bait Maal Al-Quds Al-Sharif Agency and define its objectives as being the
protection of the Holy City and its Palestinian owners. The Conference similarly expresses
its gratitude to His late Majesty's successor His Majesty King Mohamed VI who, surrounding
it with his sympathy and care, placed at its disposal generous means that made it possible
for it to embark in1mediately on its activities under the best possible circumstances; </p>

<p>Thanks the Member States of Al-Quds Committee took the initiative of making donations
in favor of the Agency. which was yet another reason why it managed to tackle without
delay the execution of its housing renovation and education projects. The summit calls
Upon all Member States to support the Agency and facilitate its mission with a view to
mustering all its potentialities and using all the financial capabilities to contribute
towards the achievement of its projects in Al-Quds A1-Sharif; </p>

<p>Lays stress on pursuing the work and coordination with international and regional
organizations for the implementation of the international resolutions and decisions
adopted by the United Nations and its specialized agencies, especially the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and coordination as well with
the League of Arab States as well as the holding of conferences aimed at shedding light
and acquainting people with the issue of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and expounding the dangers
lying in wait for it; </p>

<p>l4- Invites the Vatican, the Eastern Churches and other churches and Christian
religious orders to take action for resisting the judajzation of the City of Al-Quds
Al-Sharif, keen as they are to respect the spiritual dimension of all the religions as a
safeguard to peaceful coexistence amongst them, and in observance of Security Council
resolution 242 of November 22, 1967, urging Israel to evacuate all the occupied
territories it invaded in 1967, including the City of A-Quds, along with the rest of the
Security Council resolutions, especially 

<ul>
  <li>No. 465 of March 1, 1980, confirming the illegality of the building of Israeli
    colonialist settlements in this part and stressing that they ought to be dismantled and
    removed;</li>
  <li>No. 476 dated June 30, 1980, emphasizing that all measures which altered the features of
    the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and its geographic demographic and historic status &quot;are
    null and void&quot; and must be reversed according to the relevant Security Council
    resolutions and decisions;</li>
  <li>No. 478 dated&nbsp; August 20, 1980, deciding not to recognize the so-called
    &quot;Fundamenta1 Law&quot; and other such Israeli acts designed, as a that decision, to
    alter the features and Status of Al-Quds. It urged the states which established diplomatic
    missions in Al-Quds to remove them from the Holy City . It also called for support to help
    the inhabitants of Al-Quds Al-Shari' resist the judajzation measures and their uprooting
    from their own City; </li>
</ul>

<p>Welcomes the basic agreement signed between the PLO and the Vatican, February 15, 2000,
which agreement considers any unilateral decisions or actions, such as altering the
distinctive character of Al-Quds and its legal status as rejected both morally and
legally. It underlines necessity for joint Islamic. Christian action to preserve the City
of Al-Quds and its religious, historic, civilization-related and cultura1 character: </p>

<p>Reiterates the resolutions and decisions of the previous Islamic conferences affirming
support for the City of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and fostering of the steadfastness of its
children and calling for support as well to be extended to Bait Maal Al-Quds Al-Sharif and
Al-Quds Fund; </p>

<p>Charges the Secretary-General to follow-up the implementation of the present resolution
and report thereon to the tenth (10th ) session of the Islamic Summit Conference. </p>
