Islamic Summit Conference on Al-Aqsa Intifada- Palestinian Independence Intifada</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kings, Presidents and Emirs of the States of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) held a special session in Doha, on 12 November, 2000t in the framework of
the proceedings of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference, to express their solidarity with
the blessed Al-Aqsa Intifada of the Palestinian people against the barbaric Israeli
aggression, and to consider its serious consequences. </p>

<p>The leaders were unanimous that the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference is held in
extremely serious circumstances m the history of our Islamic Ummah due to the difficult
and tragic conditions as well as brutal crime prevailing in the Palestinian territories
and the Islamic and Christian holy sites, resulting from the war launched by Israel
against the Palestinian people, using its American made military machine: aircraft. tanks,
rockets naval boats and internationally prohibited ammunitions. This onslaught has led to
the martyrdom of more than two hundred and the injury of&nbsp; thousand unarmed
Palestinian citizens. Israel continues to lay siege to all Palestinian cities and
villages, isolating them from the outside world. as was the case with Bethlehem, Bait Jala
Bait Sahour, Ramallah, A1-Beer AI-Khalil, Nablus and Gaza which was shelled by helicopters
and tanks. Th.e blocade against citizens, goods and supplies has been tightened;
Palestinian infrastructure, institutions, centers, institutes, university buildings,
places of worship and houses have been destroyed. </p>

<p>This Wantonly, dastardly and premeditated Israeli aggression comes within the framework
of the Israeli policy aimed at imposing a fait accompli and judaizing.i2ing the Holy City,
represented by the illegitimate Israeli measures and practices, including the criminal
attempt to bum down Al Aqsa Mosque, opening tunnels underneath in order to destroy it and
the stoning by the Likud party leader Ariel Sharon of the blessed Qudsi precinct with the
connivance and protection of the Israeli government and forces, which provoked the rage of
Muslims and Christians and believers world over. </p>

<p>Such an overt aggression is a blatant violation of the Palestinian people and . their
human rights and a flagrant breach of all the internatinal covenants, conventions and the
International Humanitarian Law, especially the 4t1 Geneva Convention of 1949t while
destroying the peace-building efforts in the area. It will have serious consequences for
the middle East and world secretly and peace, thus necessitating inviting the USA to
assume a just. honest and humanitarian stance vis-a.vis the Israeli bloody aggression
against the Palestinian people and to shoulder its responsibilities </p>

<p>The leaders condemn the large- scale, systematic and substantial violations of human
rights committed by the Israeli occupation authorities, in particular acts of mass murder
and communal punishments, such as the demolition of houses and closure of the; Palestinian
territories. These are actions that constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity and
gross breach of the International Humanitarian Law, as well as a flagrant and serious
violation of the right of the Palestinian people to life. </p>

<p>The leaders condemn the aggressive and systematic policy of the Israeli occupation
authorities to confiscate lands build and expand Israeli settlements on them, especially
in the city of Al-Quds, , build roads. and all other settlement activites, as all of this
is considered a stark violation of the UN resolutions and the International Humanitarian
Law in particular, the Geneva Convention of 1949. They consider such Israeli actions as
null and void, and with no legal effect whatsoever. and must be dismantled according to
Security Council resolution 465. </p>

<p>The leaders condemn the Israeli policy of persistently violating the international
legitimacy and the peace process as it is inconceivable to proceed forward with a
political process based on the principle of land for peace while Israel is strengthening
its settlement activities. </p>

<p>While they pay tribute to the legitimate Intifada of the Palestinian people against the
Israeli occupation. the leaders affirm their support and assistance to this blessed
uprising hail the memory of the martyrs, pray for their pure souls. and wish the injured a
speedy reovery. The leaders emphasize their f'1nn adherence to the parameters approved by
the Charter of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the OIC adopted resolutions.
They are committed to exerting all efforts to achieve this goal. They affronted their
resolve to continue utilizing Arab and Islamic potentials to serve the causes of their
Ummah and deploy all capabilities to liberate the occupied Arab territories and support
the struggle of e Palestinian people in order to restore their land. return the refugees
and establish their state on their national soil with AI-Quds as its capital, and also to
safeguard Islamic and Christian holy places in Palestine. </p>

<p>The leaders express their support to the resolutions of the Arab Extraordinary: Summit
Conference. held in Cairo on 21-22 October 2000, especially its resolution on setting up
two funds for the sake of preserving the Arab and Islamic identity of Al-Quds to preclude
its obliteration and curtailing Palestinian sovereignty over the City. and enabling the
Palestinian people to offset their huge material losses and get rid of dependency on the
Israeli economy, as well as supporting the families of the Palestinian martyrs as well as
establishing the means for taking care of their children and attending to their education
in addition to rehabilitating the injured people. They invite the OIC Member States to
contribute towards financing both funds.</p>

<p>The leaders emphasize the necessity of extending financial support to Bait Mal Al-Quds
Al-Sharif Agency, and Al-Quds Fund and its Waqf, in order to enable them to perform thier
tasks of safegurdaring the Arab -Islamic identity of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and strengthening
the steadfastness of its people. They call on the OIC member State, the public and private
Islamic financial and economic institutions, businessmen and individuals to extend
generous donations to support Bil Mal Al-Quds Al-Sharif Agency, Al-Quds Fund&nbsp; and its
Waqf, to enable them to implement their approved projects in support of the steadfastness
of the Palestinian people in the Holy City . </p>

<p>The leaders call for taking measures to facilitate importation or Palestinian
commodities after ensuring the certificate of origin issued by the Palestinian Chamber of
Commerce. They also call for exemption or these commodities from tarrifs and lifting of
barriers. </p>

<p>The Summit requests the OIC Member States witch have already established. or started to
take steps to establish relations with Israel in the framework of the Peace Process to
sever these relations including the closing or missions and offices. cutting economic ties
and stopping all forms or normalization until Israel fully and genuinely implements UN
resolutions on the cause of Palestine and Al.Quds AL-Sharif, and the Arab-Israeli
conflict. and until just and comprehensive peace is established in the region.</p>

<p>The leaders call for commitment to apply the provisions of Islamic boycott of Israel.</p>

<p>They request world&nbsp; states to a abide by UN Security Council resolution 478 (
1980)calling for the non-transfer of their diplomatic missions to the city of Al-Quds.
They expresses condemnation and rejection of the decisions adopted by the US Congress as
well as statements on recognition of AI-Quds as the capital of Israel. and the transfer of
the US Embassy to the holy city. This is considered as a blatant violation of the UN
Security Council resolution 478(1980) and an open provocation to the sentiments of
Muslims, Christians and believers an over the world. It calls for severance of relations
with any state that transfers its Embassy to Al-Quds or recognize the latter as the
capital of Israel. </p>

<p>They emphasize d1e importance of continuing to focus the mass media on developments and
the confrontations of the Intifada heroes in the Palestinian territories. They emphasize
the importance of holding meetings with scholars. experts and specialists to promote
awareness of the Islamic people and information about the fact and developments of the
Palestinian issues. </p>

international mass media in order to raise world conscience and mobilize international
support and sympathy with the legitimate national Struggle of the Palestinian people. </p>

<p>Also stress the need to work for safeguarding the rights of Palestinian citizens killed
or wounded through Israeli repressive practices. by making Israel liable for appropriate
compensation&nbsp; for damage sustained by them their families and property as a result of
these practices. </p>

<p>The leaders reaffirm the unflagging Islamic position on the cause of AI-Quds and its
importance for the Islamic world in particular the provisions of the recommendations
adopted by the 181h Session of the AI-Quds Committee. held in Agadir Kingdom of Morocco on
28 August 2000. This position asserts its Support for the position of the State of
Palestine asserting its sovereignty over East Jerusalem as the capital of the independent
State of Palestine including the holy Shrines of Al-Quds and all the Islamic and Christian
holy places which form an integral pan of the Palestinian territories occupied since June

all other UN members to do the same. </p>

their homes and property and compensations for the damages sustained as a result of

<p>The leaders firmly reject any deviation from. prevarication or circumvention of the
peace process and its principles and any offers or proposals that are not based on
international legality. They also affirm their full solidarity with the Palestinian
position in confirming attempts to dictate unjust, conditional and unacceptable
settlements&nbsp; </p>
