extra-judicial killings</b><br>

<!--							<b>Author:</b> G?ran Persson<br><br>	-->The European Union deplores the practice of so-called &quot;eliminations&quot; or
extra-judicial killings of Palestinians carried out by Israeli security forces. On 21
January 2001 a demarche reflecting this concern was made to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
The existence of such a policy was later confirmed by the Israeli side. On 13 February a
new extra-judicial killing was carried out in Gaza. </p>

<p>The European Union reiterates its strongly held opinion that Israel's policy in this
regard is unacceptable and contrary to the rule of law. The European Union urges Israel to
cease this practice and thus respect international law. </p>

<p>The European Union believes that extra-judicial killings are an obstacle to peace and
could provoke further violence. </p>

<p>The European Union reiterates its deep concern about the chain of violent events during
the last months and holds that it is the responsibility of the Israeli as well as of the
Palestinian authorities to do their utmost to prevent actions resulting in new victims.<br>
