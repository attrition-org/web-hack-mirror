Session of the EURO- MEDITERRANEAN Parliamentary Forum <br>
(Brussels, 8 and 9 February 2001) </strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="3">&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>The 2<sup>nd</sup> session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum was held in
    Brussels on 8 and 9 February 2001 and was attended by parliamentarians representing the
    parliaments of the Mediterranean countries participating in the Barcelona process, the
    national parliaments of the Member States of the European Union and the European
    Parliament;</li>
  <li>The participating members first welcome the fact that this second session is being held
    at a time when the need for dialogue and cooperation in every area of the partnership is
    greater than ever, because of the various conflicts and crises affecting the process
    initiated at Barcelona in 1995;</li>
  <li>The participants agree that the Euro-Mediterranean Forum will meet annually and will
    constitute a genuine forum for exchanges of views between parliamentarians of the European
    Union and of the Mediterranean countries, with a view to giving fresh impetus to, and
    developing, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. This is why they decide to set up a
    permanent body consisting of Members of the European Parliament, of the national
    parliaments of the Member States and of the parliaments of the Mediterranean partner
    countries to enable work to continue between sessions.</li>
  <li>The participants in the Forum regret that the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean
    partnership has not satisfactorily fulfilled all the expectations aroused when it was
    launched in Barcelona in 1995;</li>
  <li>The discussions at the Forum concern the three aspects of the partnership; the need to
    make progress with them in a dynamic, balanced and complementary manner was again
    stressed;</li>
  <li>Much of the discussion at the second session of the Forum also concerns the initiatives
    and documents presented last year by the various European institutions and, in particular,
    the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean adopted by the European Council at Feira on 19
    June 2000, the Commission&#146;s communication, &#145;Reinvigorating the Barcelona
    process&#146; and the conclusions of the 4<sup>th</sup> Conference of Euro-Mediterranean
    Foreign Ministers held in Marseilles on 15 and 16 November 2000;</li>
  <li>The contributions presented by the various Mediterranean partners and the
    recommendations and positions adopted by the various parliaments have also been amply
    presented and taken into account, including the Final Declaration of the 1<sup>st</sup>
    session of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum held on 27 and 28 October 1998 in Brussels;</li>
  <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second session of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, </p>
  <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A. The need for a new vision of the future for the
  Euro-Mediterranean region</p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Is in favour of establishing a comprehensive partnership based on the approach adopted
    in the Barcelona Declaration, taking account, in every case, of the mutual interests of
    the parties and setting out a genuine strategic perspective for the whole of the region;</li>
  <li>Reminds the States which are partners in the Barcelona Process of the need to establish
    an external policy for the region which accords it the importance it deserves and which
    takes account of its geopolitical significance and of the ties created by geography and by
    a long shared history;</li>
  <li>On the eve of the enlargement of the European Union, points out the need for Europe to
    turn to the countries of the southern Mediterranean and to strengthen their mutual
    cooperation in the context of the partnership;</li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B. The new common strategy of the European Union for the region</p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Notes the adoption at Feira on 19 June 2000 of the new common strategy for the
    Mediterranean region, but regrets that the partner States were not much more closely
    involved in drafting this common strategy;</li>
  <li>Considers that the new strategy must lead to the establishment of an area of peace and
    stability based on political partnership and economic and commercial cooperation and the
    human and cultural dimension; it must also lead to the formation of a region of shared
    prosperity by means of the gradual establishment of a free-trade area between the European
    Union and its partners and among the partners themselves, and to better understanding
    between the peoples of the region and the emergence of a more active civil society;</li>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C. The need to impart fresh impetus to the Barcelona Process </p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Reaffirms that strict respect for human rights, individual liberties and democratic
    principles as fundamental elements in the creation of an area of peace, stability and
    sustainable economic development in the Euro-Mediterranean region is essential to the
    Barcelona Process;</li>
  <li>Gives its support to the strengthening of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership in which
    solidarity should play a far greater role and which should be far more effective than at
    present. This partnership should also be based on respect for national sovereignty and on
    justice, mutual trust and democratic parliamentary dialogue; in this context the
    Parliamentary Forum intends to play a much more active role in order to counteract the
    excessively intergovernmental approach of the current process and to integrate to a
    greater extent the views of public opinion in the process;</li>
  <li>The Forum takes the view that the progress made in the text of the Euro-Mediterranean
    association remains insufficient and calls on all the governments of the States which are
    parties to the Barcelona Process and on the institutions concerned to step up their
    efforts to improve financial and technical assistance, to impart fresh impetus to
    political cooperation and to do everything in their power to make full use of all the
    opportunities offered by the new MEDA II programme;</li>
  <li>Also calls for the revised Barcelona Process not to establish any hierarchy among the
    three current fields for action and for the qualitative importance of social, cultural and
    immigration aspects to be equivalent to that assigned to economic and political aspects;</li>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D. The Middle East conflict and peace process and their impact on
  the Barcelona Process</p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Since the Middle East conflict and the peace process are already on the Forum's agenda,
    the Forum unanimously deplores the loss of human life and the material damage caused by
    the conflict; unreservedly supports the efforts to negotiate a comprehensive, just peace
    in the Middle East on the basis of strict compliance with all relevant UN resolutions
    concerning the problems of refugees, security, borders, settlements and Jerusalem, on the
    basis of the principles of the Madrid Conference and the subsequent agreements concluded
    between the conflicting parties;</li>
  <li>Unanimously calls for a much more active political role to be played by the European
    Union with a view to securing progress in the Middle East peace process and welcomes the
    initiative of involving the Secretary-General of the Council/High Representative of the
    European Union in the work of the fact-finding commission decided upon at Sharm-el-Sheikh;
    also stresses the importance it attaches to privilege diplomatic channels and dialogue in
    the search for a just and lasting peace in the region;</li>
  <li>Calls for the unconditional lifting of all restrictions on the free movement of persons
    and goods within, to and from the Palestinian territories, in accordance with the Oslo
    agreements;</li>
  <li>Requests that negotiations resume in the immediate future, on the basis of the progress
    made during the latest negotiations, and reaffirms that renunciation of the excessive use
    of force and of all forms of violence is an essential condition to be respected, as
    required by the relevant international conventions;</li>
  <li>Unanimously expresses its support for the right of the Palestinian people to a
    sovereign, democratic, viable and peaceful State and the right of the people of Israel to
    live in safety within secure and recognised borders;</li>
  <li>Stresses the need to ensure that the spirit of partnership is maintained by more
    frequent parliamentary meeting and recognises that a favourable development of the Middle
    East peace process constitutes the basis for reinforcing and reinvigorating the
    Euro-Mediterranean Partnership;</li>
  <li>Calls on the European Commission to continue to support the Palestinian National
    Authority and its institutions and, at the same time, declares European Union's
    determination to continue cooperation with Israel whilst respecting the commitments and
    principles underlying Euro-Mediterranean policy;</li>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E. Other issues of interest to the partnership</p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Calls for the lifting of the economic embargo on Iraq for humanitarian reasons and for
    compliance with the United Nations resolutions;</li>
  <li>In the light of the most recent developments, wishes the obstacles linked to the embargo
    to be removed, in accordance with the United Nations resolutions, so that Libya can take a
    full part in the Barcelona Process;</li>
  <li>Reiterates its call for Mauritana to be able to participate as a full member in the
    political dialogue of the Barcelona Process;</li>
  <li>Expresses its conviction of the need to find a solution to the problem of Cyprus which
    complies with the UN resolutions, and appreciates the efforts made by the
    Secretary-General to find a solution to the Cypriot problem;</li>
</ol>
<i>

<ol START="6" TYPE="A">
  <b>
  <li>The political and security partnership; the desirability of a new Euro-Mediterranean
    political and security association to promote stability in the region</li>
</ol>
</b></i>

<ol>
  <li>Regrets that it was not possible to adopt the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and
    Stability at the 4<sup>th</sup> Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles and hopes that
    it will be adopted as soon as possible and that this Charter will develop politically and
    will genuinely be able to contribute to the implementation of the principles stated in the
    Barcelona Declaration as regards all aspects of peace and stability in the region;</li>
  <li>Agrees on the need to broaden the agenda for political dialogue in the region to include
    a number of other topics relating to security, arms control, terrorism, migration, respect
    for human rights and the principle of the rule of law, as well as issues relating to the
    environment, the safety of maritime transport and combating drug-trafficking;</li>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">G. The role of civil society in the revised Barcelona Process</p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Attaches the utmost importance to supporting civil society and to far closer involvement
    by civil society in all its forms in the activities of the Barcelona Process, by means,
    inter alia, of greater support for the MEDA Democracy programme and also by promoting
    participation by local authorities and institutions in the work of the partnership;</li>
  <li>Encourages the States participating in the Barcelona Process and the institutions
    concerned to draw up information and communication programmes in order to make all their
    citizens aware of the activities involved in this Process;</li>
  <li>Calls for the adoption of measures to promote the development of the information
    society, the use of the Internet and investment in information and schooling;</li>
  <li>Calls also for an assessment to be carried out of the partner countries' capacity to
    absorb the budgetary resources allocated under the MEDA programme and of the financial
    instruments of the new European strategy for the Mediterranean;</li>
  <li>Recommends consolidating all the mechanisms and programmes for promoting women in order
    to involve them more in the Barcelona Process and welcomes the convening of the
    Euro-Mediterranean Women&#146;s Parliamentary Forum to be held in Malta on 2 and 3 March
    2001;</li>
  <li>Welcomes the work carried out by the Euro-Mediterranean network of economic and social
    councils and the representatives of organised civil society;</li>

<ol START="8" TYPE="A">
  <i><b>
  <li>Economic and trade aspects of the Barcelona Process and the establishment of a free
    trade area</li>
</ol>

<ol START="36">
  </b></i>
  <li>Expresses its agreement with the creation of a free trade area by 2010, which should
    involve the creation of a genuine &#145;common market&#146; for all goods, capital and
    services. In this connection a regulatory framework and a timetable for harmonisation
    measures in certain priority sectors could already be established between now and 2002;</li>
  <li>Agrees that this free trade area should cover all sectors and help to improve the
    quality of life in all the partner countries, and calls for the highest possible level of
    prosperity and social cohesion to be attained in the framework of this free trade area;</li>
  <li>Notes that foreign direct investment in the region is inadequate and encourages all the
    partner States and institutions concerned to increase investment constantly; also
    considers it desirable and useful to provide the Mediterranean partner States with
    comprehensive information on all aspects of the Euro and the European economy;</li>
  <li>Recommends particularly the development, as soon as possible, of a large volume of
    South-South trade in order better to integrate all the economies of the countries in the
    region;</li>
  <li>Gives particular backing to the regional integration process across the Mediterranean
    Basin and calls for the creation of a new regional development financial institution;</li>
  <li>Favours debt conversion, given that the Mediterranean countries' development efforts are
    greatly handicapped by debt; takes the view that there should be priority reinvestment of
    converted external debt in co-development policies involving the Mediterranean countries;</li>
  <li>Calls for regional cooperation projects to be brought into line with environmental
    requirements and sustainable development; partner countries are asked to take the
    necessary measures with regard to integrated management of water resources, waste
    disposal, critical points (polluted areas and biodiversity risks) integrated management of
    coastal areas and measures to combat desertification, making use of the European Union's
    know-how and experience;</li>
</ol>

<ol START="8" TYPE="A">
  <i><b>
  <li>Bilateral economic relations and the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements</li>
</ol>

<ol START="36">
  </b></i>
  <li>Expresses its support for the free movement of goods and services in the
    Euro-Mediterranean zone and for improving free movement of persons, as well as for the
    need for progressive, reciprocal liberalisation of agricultural trade in accordance with
    the principles laid down in the Barcelona Process and the WTO rules; calls on the
    institutions concerned to draw up a Euro-Mediterranean development policy for agriculture
    taking account of the social, territorial and environmental dimensions of agriculture;</li>
  <li>Calls on the Member States to speed up the process of ratification of the bilateral
    agreements already signed and encourages the conclusion, as soon as possible, of
    Association Agreements with the countries in respect of which the procedure is still under
    way;</li>
  <li>Calls for the Association Agreements to be ultimately consolidated in a multilateral
    agreement on the common issues, and encourages all partner countries which have signed an
    Association Agreement with the European Union to conclude, within the next five years,
    free-trade agreements with all the other signatories to an Association Agreement;</li>
  <li>Takes the view that the development of cooperation in the area of public services
    (transport, energy, telecommunications, health) would be conducive to the economic
    development of the Mediterranean countries and to satisfying the needs of their people;
    also wishes an assessment to be carried out of the economic, social and environmental
    consequences of the Association Agreements already implemented, with a view to benefiting
    from their lessons;</li>
  <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">J.<i> Strengthening Euro-Mediterranean association in the social,
  cultural and human spheres which bring it closer to the people of the region</p>
  </i></b>
  <li>Regrets that this aspect had not been sufficiently developed in relation to the
    political and economic aspects of the Barcelona Process, and calls in particular for
    account to be taken of the social impact of economic transition in the various national
    programmes;</li>
  <li>Calls for the implementation of policies for vocational training, universities,
    technology and education, the definition of local and regional development programmes, the
    promotion of programmes to further equal opportunities, health and safety at work, and
    promotion of the role of women in economic development and support for women's
    organisations, associations, businesses and networks in the countries of the region;</li>
  <li>Expresses its support for the regional programmes under way in the culture, audiovisual
    and youth fields in the context of a spirit of cultural identity, and voices its
    satisfaction at the recent launching of the Euromed Heritage II programme, as well as its
    support for the implementation, as soon as possible,of the Euromed Heritage and Euromed
    Audiovisual II programmes;</li>
  <li>Recognises the importance of cross-border cooperation and, in this connection, calls on
    the Mediterranean partner States to use the experience of the INTERREG programme and the
    spirit of partnership to promote cross-border cooperation between the two shores of the
    Mediterranean;</li>
  <li>Stresses the need to launch a regional programme in the sphere of justice and home
    affairs, which should pay particular attention to cooperation in combating smuggling and
    trafficking in persons and to the establishment of co-development strategies;</li>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">K. Support for a new approach to issues concerning immigration
  and the free movement of persons</p>
  </b></i>
  <li>Recommends that the partner States and the European Union introduce harmonised
    legislation on migration flow organisation and the fight against illegal immigration, lay

    policy of integration in host countries for lawfully resident immigrants;</li>
  <li>Decides to set up an internal working party with responsibility for migration and human
    exchanges to meet during the inter-session periods, consisting of one member from each
    parliament of the countries party to the Barcelona Process, plus appropriate European
    Parliament representation. This working party should follow closely the work of the
    Migration Observatory proposed for the European Commission with a view to ongoing and
    detailed follow-up to all issues concerning migration flow in the Mediterranean region;</li>
  <li>Invites the European governments to accord immigrants resident in the European Union
    equal treatment with regard to economic and social rights and recognition of civil and
    cultural rights and to consider recognition of certain political rights;</li>
