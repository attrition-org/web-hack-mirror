<p><strong><font color="#B80000">POLITICAL STATEMENT<br>
<br>
THE RESULTS OF THE ARAB SUMMIT MEETING IN CAIRO<br>
</font></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The Special Emergency session of the Summit meeting of Arab States, which took place in
Cairo on October 21st and 22nd,<br>
2000, has ended with a series of resolutions and measures aimed at providing moral,
political and material support to the<br>
Palestinian people, to the PLO and to the PNA in their resistance to the military
aggression launched by the Israeli occupation<br>
forces, in their criminal and vain attempt to substitute violence to negotiations, to
impose their will by force and to avoid<br>
implementation of the signed agreements and of the resolutions adopted by the
international community.<br>
<br>
We express our satisfaction and our deep gratitude to our Arab brothers, both at popular
and at official level, for this firm stand<br>
of solidarity with our people, who are the victims of a barbarous campaign of armed
violence and settler-terrorism, against<br>
disarmed children, peaceful protesters and the Palestinian civilian population at large.
We hail the unprecedented unity manifest<br>
in the course and results of that Summit, and the sense of responsibility displayed by
Arab leaders in dealing with this grave<br>
crisis, which threatens the welfare and stability of all states in our region. All are
aware that failure to prevent further escalation<br>
on the ground may ignite a series of reactions and counter-reactions liable to set the
whole Mediterranean environment on a fire<br>
of incalculable and probably uncontrollable consequences. <br>
<br>
We also hail the maturity and political wisdom with which Arab leaders have reasserted our
common commitment to<br>
negotiations and peace as a strategic choice, together with the will to restore the legal
and procedural terms of reference for a<br>
fruitful political process: international legality, relevant UN resolutions, and the
general principles of Human rights. The call to<br>
condition regional cooperation and the furthering of commercial relations with Israel to
Israeli compliance with these elementary<br>
requirements, and to an effective halting of military aggression, is a reasonable and
balanced stand, away from any empty<br>
rhetorical threats. The determination to make rational use of economic ties, including
those linked to energy, in order to enhance<br>
a serious search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace is also an encouraging
signal, which should be read earnestly by the<br>
international community as a whole. <br>
<br>
The support to our demand that an impartial commission of inquiry, under UN auspices, be
constituted; the demand for an<br>
international tribunal, on the model of the jurisdictions established to punish war
criminals in former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda;<br>
the pledge to provide immediate material support to the victims of the aggression, to the
families of the martyrs and to the<br>
wounded, but also to support the resistance of our people in Jerusalem, and to provide
relief to the ruined Palestinian economy<br>
- all those demonstrate a serious and sincere commitment to the cause of peace and justice
in our area.<br>
<br>
Finally, we want to underline that the summit, while rejecting categorically any
irresponsible call for war, has unequivocally<br>
rejected the Israeli attempts at depicting popular protest as an aggression, and expressed
its full support to the continuation of<br>
the Intifada.<br>
<br>
We expect the whole international community to take the measure of this responsible stand,
and act accordingly. The United<br>
Nations must recover their leading role in the coordination of efforts to bring the
aggressor back to the negotiating table, and<br>
first and foremost to create the instruments of international protection for the
Palestinian people. <br>
<br>
