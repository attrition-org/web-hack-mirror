<p>Amman - Following is an unofficial translation of the final communique issued at the
conclusion on Wednesday of the Arab League's 13 session held at the summit level in Amman,
under the presidency of His Majesty King Abdullah: </font><font size="2" color="#000000"></p>
</font>

<p><font size="3">l. Upon the invitation of His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan and in
implementation of the extraordinary Arab summit resolution held in Cairo on Oct. 21-22,
2000, the Arab League held its meeting at the summit level at the annual ordinary level in
Amman, capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on March 27-28, 2001. <br>
2. The Arab leaders express their appreciation to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for its
care and attention and preparations for the summit and the deep meanings contained in the
opening address of His Majesty King Abdullah, the summit's current president, and decided
to consider his address as an official summit document. <br>
3. The Arab leaders express their appreciation to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for his
effort during his chairmanship of the extraordinary summit of October 2000. <br>
4. The Arab leaders regard the meetings in Amman today as the first regular conference
representing a new move in the march of common Arab action and has taken several
resolutions and initiatives required by the Arab situation and tackling the nation's vital
issues. In this light, the Arab leaders said restoration of Arab solidarity constitutes
the basic support and the source of power for the nation and for safeguarding its security
and fending off dangers posed to this nation and as an embodiment of the nation's
aspirations towards integration and solidarity. <br>
This conference constituted a prominent event and an opportunity to renew the pledge of
commitment to the basic principles on which Arab common action is based, the respect for
the principles that govern inter-Arab relations and safeguard Arab countries' vital
interests and the attainment of inter-Arab agreements and national security. <br>
5. With respect to the Arab League Charter and its objectives, and in an atmosphere of
brotherly understanding, the Arab leaders studied the present prevailing situation and the
challenges the nation is facing and the general situation in the region. They conducted a
comprehensive assessment of the current circumstances at the regional and international
levels, focusing their attention on strengthening Arab solidarity, reviving the work of
institutions towards joint Arab action for the defence of the nation's interests and
rights and Arab national security. <br>
6. The Arab leaders reviewed the dangerous situation facing the Palestinian people in
light of the aggression of Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinians, employing
all forms and means to repress the Palestinians using internationally prohibited weapons
and clamping an economic blockade on the Palestinians, pursuing the policy of building
settlements, the policy of assassinations and demolition of Arab homes and pollution of
the environment. <br>
These actions have been flagrant violations of all agreements and principles of
international law and norms. <br>
7. The Arab leaders take pride in the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and their
heroic Intifada in the face of fierce aggression waged by Israel, and their resistance to
the brutal oppression exercised by the occupation authority. <br>
The Arab leaders salute the martyrs of the Intifada, praise the spirit of sacrifice and
steadfastness of the Palestinian people who have, with unrelenting determination and
unlimited sacrifice, confronted the Israeli oppressive measures and aborted the de facto
situation which the Israeli authority has tried to impose on the Palestinians and the
Palestinian negotiators by force. <br>
The Arab leaders declared their support for the Palestinian people in their heroic
struggle and their Intifada, and the right to resist occupation until all national and
just demands for the right to return, for the right to self-determination have been
attained. The leaders declare that they stand beside the Palestinian people in their
heroic struggle and support their Intifada and their legitimate right to resist the
occupation until they achieve their just national rights including returning to their
lands, determining their future and establishing an independent state on their national
land with Jerusalem as their capital. <br>
8. The Arab leaders salute the steadfastness of the Syrian people in the occupied Syrian
Golan Heights and their adherence to the national identity. <br>
9. The leaders condemn Israel's continuing aggression against the Palestinian people and
its massive violation of human rights, especially its collective punishment, its breaking
up of the Palestinian territories and its continued attacks on vital utilities... which
are tantamount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. <br>
10. The leaders express their extreme indignation at the United States' use of its veto in
the Security Council against the draft resolution about protection for the Palestinian
people... and express their complete rejection of the American justifications. This
position does not conform at all with the United States' responsibilities as a sponsor of
the peace process. <br>
The leaders call for a meeting of the parties to the 1949 Geneva Convention as soon as
possible to take measures to guarantee the protection of the Palestinian people. <br>
11. The leaders renew their demand for the Security Council to take responsibility for
providing the necessary international protection for the Palestinian people suffering
under Israeli occupation and to set up an international force to that end. <br>
12. The leaders demand that the Security Council try Israeli war criminals who have
committed massacres and crimes against Arab citizens throughout the Arab occupied
territories and elsewhere. <br>
13. The leaders welcome the decision by the high council for Al Aqsa and Intifada funds to
respond urgently to support the budget of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) with a
payment of $15 million from a $60 million approved soft loan. <br>
They also commission the council to respond favourably to the demand of the PNA to extend
an additional amount of $180 million to support the budget over the next six months. The
leaders welcome the Republic of Iraq's designation of one billion euros from its oil
export sales, in accordance with the (UN agreed to oil-for-food) memorandum of
understanding, to secure the food and medical needs of the Palestinians and other
essential supplies. <br>
They commission the Arab permanent representatives in New York to follow up on this and
facilitate Iraq's request (to supply the funds) with the Security Council. <br>
14. The leaders &quot;demand that the countries of the world not move their embassies (in
Israel from Tel Aviv) to Jerusalem. In this context, they renew their emphasis on
decisions made by Arab summits in Amman in 1980, in Baghdad in 1990 and Cairo in 2000
regarding breaking all relations with countries that relocate their embassies to Jerusalem
or recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. <br>
15. They stress again that a just and comprehensive peace in the region initially requires
a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian lands including Jerusalem,
as well as from Syria's Golan Heights to the borders of June 4, 1967, and from Lebanese
lands still under occupation, to internationally recognised borders, including the Shebaa
Farms. <br>
16. The leaders warn the Israeli government of the consequences of turning its back on the
bases and principles on which the (Middle East) peace process was launched in Madrid in
1991. <br>
They warned Israel against &quot;proposing alternatives to peace that do not conform with
international resolutions&quot; such as Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338
stipulating an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land. <br>
The Arab leaders emphasise that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are concurrent and are
linked to the Palestinian track, and they warned the Israelis against dealing with
individual tracks separate from the others. They stress again that a just and
comprehensive peace in the region initially requires a complete Israeli withdrawal from
all the occupied Palestinian lands including Jerusalem as well as from Syria's Golan
Heights to the borders of June 4, 1967, and from Lebanese lands still under occupation to
internationally recognised borders, including the Shebaa Farms. <br>
The leaders stress that commitment to the peace process requires that Israel implement the
agreements and obligations made... and the resumption of negotiations on all tracks from
where they stopped. <br>
17. Arab leaders hold Israel responsible for the Palestinian refugee problem and they
reject Israel's attempts at settling the refugees outside their national homeland. <br>
18. The Arab leaders &quot;demand reactivating the Arab boycott against Israel by holding
regular boycott conferences which the Central Office of the Boycott (in Damascus) has
called for with the aim of preventing any dealings with Israel. <br>
The leaders decide... to continue to stop all steps towards, and activities of, regional
economic cooperation with Israel. <br>
The leaders renew their decision at the Cairo summit in 2000 to firmly challenge Israeli
attempts to infiltrate the Arab world in any form, and from now on to stop opening
relations with Israel. <br>
They hold Israel responsible for any steps and decisions made by Arab states regarding
relations with Israel, including their cancellation. <br>
19. The Arab leaders emphasise their solidarity with Lebanon and Syria and they reject
Israeli threats against the two countries, and the threats against Arab countries and the
Palestinian people and leadership. They condemn the use of force, stress the need for
studying this dangerous situation and call for a pan-Arab strategy that would expose
Israel's plots and plans that threaten peace and security in the region. <br>
20. They stress their support for Lebanon to complete the liberation of its lands still
under Israeli occupation to internationally recognised borders, including the Shebaa
Farms. They praise the role of the Lebanese resistance and demand the release of Lebanese
people jailed in Israel. <br>
21. The Arab leaders stressed that peace and security requires that Israel join a treaty
for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and subject its nuclear installations to
international inspection. They also stress that the Middle East region should remain free
of weapons of mass destruction. <br>
22. The leaders stress that commitment to the peace process requires that Israel implement
the agreements and obligations concluded... and the resumption of negotiations on all
tracks from where they stopped. <br>
23. The Arab leaders appeal to all countries concerned with the peace process, including
the European Union, to play an effective role in removing obstacles in the path of peace. <br>
24. The Arab leaders urge the United Nations to play a greater role to help implement
Middle East resolutions. <br>
25. The Arab summit asked King Abdullah to undertake further consultations and contacts to
improve relations between Iraq and Kuwait. <br>
26. The Arab leaders congratulate Bahrain and Qatar for the settlement of their border
dispute and they consider the settlement as a strengthening of inter-Arab solidarity. <br>
27. The Arab leaders congratulate Saudi Arabia and Qatar for the settlement of their
border dispute between them. <br>
28. The Arab leaders reiterate their support for the United Arab Emirates in it struggle
to regain sovereignty of islands occupied by Iran in the Arabian Gulf and urge Iran to end
its occupation of the islands. They entrusted the Arab League secretary general to follow
up on the Iranian occupation. <br>
29. The leaders &quot;demand that the Security Council lift sanctions imposed on Libya
immediately and permanently, based on Libya's compliance with the demands of the Security
Council, because there is no longer any justification for their continuation under any
guise. <br>
The Arabs consider themselves free from any commitment to the sanctions in the event that
they are re-implemented because Libya has fulfilled all its obligations as required by the
Security Council. <br>
The leaders &quot;demand the immediate release of Libyan citizen Abdul Basset Ali Al
Megrahi (found guilty in January of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland
in 1988) who was convicted for political reasons. <br>
30. The Arab leaders welcome that the leaders of the Republic of Somalia carry on and
complete efforts for strengthening national unity, and they pledge to extend support for
Somalia's security and stability. <br>
31. The Arab leaders express their support for Sudan's territorial integrity and
sovereignty and support the Sudanese government's efforts to achieve peace and call on the
United Nations to lift sanctions imposed on Sudan. <br>
32. The Arab leaders reaffirmed their keenness on supporting the national unity of the
Comoros Islands and welcome efforts for achieving national reconciliation. <br>
33. The Arab leaders express their deep interest in achieving economic integration among
their countries and common Arab action in order to protect their national interests and
strengthen their national economies. <br>

establishing a pan-Arab free trade zone and have decided to remove all customs
restrictions. The have decided that each country should treat all Arab countries' goods as
national products. <br>

within the framework of a free trade agreement. They entrust the Arab Economic and Social
Council to follow up on this issue. <br>
36. The Arab leaders commend what has been achieved in the process of improving the
climate of investment and they urge Arab financial institutions to finance infrastructure
projects. <br>

issues by land, air and sea and to report to the next Arab summit meeting about this
