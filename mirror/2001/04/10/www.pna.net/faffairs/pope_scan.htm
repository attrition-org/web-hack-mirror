</strong></font><br>
VATICAN, Jan. 15, 01 (CWNews.com) -- In his annual address to the diplomats accredited to
the Holy See, Pope John Paul II pointed to several trouble spots, including the Middle
East, Indonesia, and Spain. <br>
<br>
Regarding the Middle East, the Pope warned that the international community should not
accept the &quot;banalization of a sort of guerilla warfare, the persistence of injustice,
the contempt for international law&quot; that still prevails there. He added that Israelis
and Palestinians &quot;cannot contemplate a future except their future together.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It is high time to return to the principles of international law,&quot; he said. In
a clear rebuke to the government of Israel, he spelled out the violations that should be
ended: the acquisition of territory by force, the right of all people to
self-determination, and the need to respect UN resolutions and Geneva conventions. If
these principles of international law are not respected, he continued, &quot;everything is
at risk,&quot; and the potential for &quot;an escalation of violence that will be
difficult to control.&quot; <br>
