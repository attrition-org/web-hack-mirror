<p>V.&nbsp; Continuing the Pathway T oward Defining and Achieving the Vision. </p>

<p><big>I. INTRODUCTION </big></p>

<p>For nearly a decade, the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) together
with those in the Diaspora, represented by their leadership in the PLO and the Palestinian
Authority (PA) have followed a pathway toward defining and effecting a vision for the
future with the help of the donors and other partners. That vision now can be expressed in
the following broad-based goal:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50">To develop a society that provides for the well being of the
Palestinian people through sustainable growth within the context of a democratic society
built on foundations of equitable social and economic opportunities in the context of an
independent, free, sovereign and modern entity in peace with its neighbors. </p>

<p>Arriving at this overall goal has involved, among other activities, the formulation of
both plans within and across sectors. These plans have been used to guide the PA, the
private sector, and civil society in meeting the challenges of Palestinian development. </p>

<p>While the main premise of the above mentioned goal and vision remains valid and
accurate in the overall sense, the special case of the Palestinian society and economy,
however,&nbsp; necessitates a more detailed and clearly defined development targets that,
once implemented, will eventually lead to the realization of this vision. Stated
differently, the dynamic and changing situation on the ground requires a clearly defined
vision for the Palestinian future. Given the movement from an interim arrangement toward
final status, it is imperative that the PA, together with the private sector and
Palestinian civil society, strive toward more articulated vision and strategy that take
into account such a situation.</p>

<p>Based on this logic, the objective of this docwnent is twofold: 

<ol>
  <li>to provide a clear vision of the needs of the Palestinian society in the medium term
    (2000-2005) and beyond, i.e.. after the expected conclusion of the final status
    negotiations between the PA and Israel based on the principles set out in Madrid
    Conference, and leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. These
    needs will be based on the Palestinian policy maker's own definition of future development
    targets and objectives, and will ultimately be translated into a development strategy with
    actual projects for implementation to meet these needs. </li>
  <li>to provide a general framework for the vision that will be further developed in the near
    future and used as the basis for the Palestinian Strategic Development Plan (PSDP). </li>
</ol>

<p>The logic behind the need for this vision is a straightforward and simple one. On the
verge of the announcement of the independent Palestinian state, and the conclusion of the
permanent status negotiations, this nascent state will be faced with both daunting
economic challenges and enormous economic opportunities. The challenges are related to the
legacy of the occupation years, the very restrictive environment that prevailed during the
interim period, and the challenges related to the implications of the final status
settlement. The opportunities are related to the indigenous potential that is unique to
the location of the new state, its human capital, as well as the strong international
political and economic support it is expected to enjoy. That is where economic policy and
development strategy of the new born state gains its importance so as to deal prudently
with these challenges, and to take advantage of the existing opportunities in order to
realize its full potential. </p>

<p>The medium term strategic development vision for the future state of Palestine in a
situation of permanent peace, therefore, will consist of three components. These
components, which intend to address three different aspects of the vision that will be
discussed in the span of this document, can also be looked at as the overall objectives of
the future strategic development plan. </p>

<p>(1) the continuation of the past and present efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct
the Palestinian economy and the Palestinian society. This aspect of the future vision and
development plan will deal with the current ongoing efforts to provide the Palestinian
population with adequate physical and social infrastructure services; reform and
modernization of the public sector; establishment of democratic traditions and role of
law; implementing a massive program of rehabilitation, training, and education with
special attention to those most traumatized and affected by the years of occupation and
struggle; and continuation of policy measures intended to create enabling investment
environment in Palestine. The intention here is to build on what already has been achieved
in the past few years, and to continue the efforts aimed at correcting the distortions
created by the long years of the Israeli occupation.</p>

<p>(2) addressing the challenges that will emerge as a result of the successful conclusion
of the final states negotiations and the establishment of a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace in the Middle East. These challenges pertain to: (1) the expected return
ofhundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians that left the West Bank and Gaza after
1967 war, and their smooth and productive absorption along with their families back in the
Palestinian society; (2) the expected return of more Palestinian land in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and the need to redevelop these areas so as to enhance the resource base of the
Palestinian economy; (3) the development of the expanded Palestinian water resources to
maximize and optimize its use for consumption and productive purposes; ( 4) the
construction of a free, easy, and efficient passage between the west Bank and Gaza Strip
so as to reintegrate the two parts of Palestine and create a better economic opportunities
and societal harmony; and ( 5) the construction of basic infrastructure to facilitate the
free access to the regional and world economy and improve the chances of the Palestinian
economy in regional and world trade. </p>

<p>(3) addressing the challenges of reintegrating Palestine back in the regional and world
economy, and the design and implementation of economic policies and economic management
that will lead to this goal. The intention here is to build a competitive advantage of the
Palestinian economy so as to benefit form the immense opportunities created by the twenty
first century revolution in communication and technology, and to increase the share of
Palestine in the world trade and its share of foreign direct investment in today's vastly
globalized world economy.</p>

<p>The above mentioned three main elements of the future vision for developing Palestine
in the next five years and beyond is based on the following assumptions: 

<ul>
  <li>that a comprehensive,&nbsp; just, and lasting peace agreement will be reached between
    the PLO and Israel, and that an independent Palestinian state is created to replace the
    PA. </li>
  <li>that such a peace agreement will parallel other peace agreements ending the Arab Israeli
    conflict and creating a region of stability and cooperation. </li>
  <li>that the Palestinian state will have sovereign control over its land and natural
    resources, and will enjoy a free and unfettered access to the outside world. </li>
  <li>That the international community in its quest for real lasting peace and stability will
    continue to playa major role in providing the financial resources and technical assistance
    needed to finance and implement the development needs as defined by the strategic plan. </li>
</ul>

<p>It is to be noted that the development vision presented in this document is not
intended to prejudge the final status agreement between the PLO and Israel, and in case of
any contradiction between the strategic development plan and the agreement, the plan will
be modified accordingly. </p>

<p><big>III. THE FOUNDATlON FOR DEVELOPMENT </big></p>

<p>The extraordinary array of resources on which to build the foundation for Palestinian
development will be a key to its success. The first and foremost of these is represented
in the <em>Palestinian people,</em> who are dedicated to education and to learning, rich
in entrepreneurial experience, steadfast in their concern for community and society as a
whole, and dedicated to efforts aimed toward sustainable development The extraordinary <em>cultural
heritage</em> that abounds in the region, including ancient historical areas and sacred
religious sites representing three of the major world religions (Christianity, Islam and
Judaism) represents a significant resource. <em>Natural resources,</em> while few, include
stone quarries, fisheries and the Gaza Coastal area in general ( a potential tourist
area), as well as fertile agricultural land with both existing and potential exports, such
as olives and olive oil, flowers, grapes, and other high value export crops. Finally, the <em>strategic
location</em> of the area cannot be overlooked, nor its historic advantage as a major
trade route to and from markets in the Arabian Peninsula and the East. This is coupled
with the role of Palestinians in and support received from the Arab world and Palestinians
and other Arabs in the Diaspora, including particularly in the United States, Canada, and
European countries. Finally,more recently Palestinians have negotiated <em>favorable terms
of trade</em> with key partners, including the European Union, the United States, Canada,
and China and continue to enjoy generous support from Arab and international donors. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the unique political reality that faces Palestinians in their efforts
toward sustainable development has mitigated the effective use of these resources. The
Palestinian economy is of relatively limited size, with real GDP and GNP in 1999 reaching
approximately US$ 4.7 andUS$ 5.7 billion, respectively, and a total population of about 3
million at the beginning of 2000. Real per capita GDP and GNP, respectively, hover around
US$ 1,550 and USS 1,890. The participation in the labor market is quite low, with less
than 50 percent of the working age population in the labor market, and less than 40
percent in Gaza. Indeed, in 1998 more than one-third of the population in Gaza and nearly
15 percent of the population in the West Bank lives in poverty - defined as $2 per day per
person. The PA currently controls only a fragmented and limited portion of the Palestinian
land and water resources, limiting internal and external trade, access to services, and
rational and comprehensive development of infrastructure. On the positive side, the
average illiteracy rate is just 15 percent -low by regional standards - and there are no
differences in literacy between young men and young women. The Palestinian people are
relatively healthier than most in the region, with a higher life expectancy and lower
infant mortality than most countries in the region.</p>

<p>The challenges that face our society in pursuing our vision are considerable, with a
still-fragile and relatively small economy, a rapidly growing population, and unique
constraints that impede sustainable development. Nonetheless, we have a unique opportunity
to build a model in the region for economic and social development, to strengthen public
and private sector institutions, and to create a climate that ensures efficient and
transparent governance. </p>

<p><big>III. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE VISION </big></p>

<p>In the process of collectively defining a vision for a sustainable future for
Palestinians, myriad complex: issues need to be addressed, policies formulated, and
difficult tfade,. offs made in resource allocation. Discussion of these issues among
Palestinian civil society predates the PA and these discussions have informed the
deliberations since 1994 involving the PA, the private sector, and NGOs. What is our
current thinking with respect to critical public policy areas on which a vision statement
-and the PSDP -will be built? The areas used as examples in this abbreviated document are:
institutional development, economic development, environmentl management and social
policy.</p>

<p>(a) <strong><em>Institutional Development and Strengthening</em></strong></p>

<p>Creating and strengthening public sector institutions and enhancing the relationship
between the public and private sectors has been a primary focus of donor agencies and of
the PA since its inception. For example, key laws passed by the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) that serve as a framework for development have included, for example, the
Local Government Law, the Monetary Law, the Investment Law, the Non-governmental
Organizations Law, and the Environmental Law. These are, of course, only initial steps in
the process of establishing regulatory foundations; for several of these laws, there needs
to be continued transparent development of regulations and regulatory agencies that are
mandated to oversee compliance with these regulations and to ensure their equitable
implementation.</p>

<p>Establishing a legal environment that ensures due process and encourages the upholding
of the rule of law in general is critical at this time and certainly a foundation on which
to build genuine, democratic governance structures and processes. It will also set the
stage for development and implementation of democratic practices, including, but not
limited to, electoral and policy development processes. Specific laws that are at various
stages of preparation or review that will facilitate economic development include, for
example, the Water Law, Planning and Building Act, the Education Law, and the Health Law. </p>

<p>Management strengthening is key in the areas of policy planning, phasing-in
decentralized decision-making as appropriate, program and project evaluation, and
rationalizing administrative and budgeting regulations and processes. An important tool
for all of these will be data and information systems that are compatible within and
across public institutions. </p>

<p>It should be noted here that the PA intention for institutional development and reform
was clearly evident in the formation of the Higher National Committee for Institutional
Development (HNCID) which was established by a presidential ,decree on August 11, 1999.
HNCID, an inter-ministerial committee, was mandated to undertake a major stock taking of
the Palestinian public sector and to come up with policy measures to reform and modernize
the&nbsp; PA institutions.</p>

<p>(b) <strong><em>Economic Development: Making the Best Possible Use of Resources</em></strong></p>

<p>The fundamental economic framework on which Palestinian development will be based needs
to be designed; simply stated, there is a need to determine which type of economy is the
most appropriate for our circumstances. This will undoubtedly not be a static decision;
all economies evolve over time. However, we can benefit from the experience of other
countries and the established body of literature with respect to balancing public and
private sector roles in the economy, and concerning specifically public/private roles and
Partnerships. The latter will entail addressing such thorny areas as 

<ul>
  <li>utilities and infrastructure ownership and management, </li>
  <li>the provision of essential services ( e,g., health, education), </li>
  <li>social welfare in general and in particular such issues as social security/pensions for
    public and private sector employees and income and other support for disabled and
    vulnerable populations, and </li>
  <li>public creation ,of a supportive environment for private sector ,development. </li>
  <li>public-private sector cooperation in the development of housing and infrastructure for
    the returning displaced refugees. </li>
</ul>

<p>The legal and policy frameworks that will underlie these roles must be clear defined
through a transparent process, and explicitly articulated. Importantly, the economic
framework must ensure insofar as possible that there are no &quot;unfunded mandates,&quot;
that is, policies, programs and regulations that relate to both the public and private
sectors must take into account the level of resources required to implement them.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The most pressing economic issue for Palestinian society is the need to dramatically
expand the creation of jobs with living wages, in order to diminish both unemployment and
underemployment, and to raise living standards for our people, particularly with a
population significantly expanded by returnees. But job creation does not exist in a
policy or societal vacuum. To make the maximum possible use of our human resources and to
ensure that our people are contributing to both Palestinian and global development, we
must develop policies that support the creation of productive, rewarding employment and
capacity-building for our population to meet the needs of the changing global economy. </p>

<p>The management of science, technology and innovation is a linchpin of that process.
Indeed, scientific research, technology and innovation will be a critical basis for
sustainable economic and social development for Palestinian society . Palestinians have
long been cognizant of the critical nature of this fact, as is evident in the number of
universities, research centers, and percentage of science and technology graduates, the
extent of technological innovation with limited resources, including in the areas of
manufacturing computer software and information technology in general. What is lacking is
an agreed-upon strategy to harness and build on these achievements. The public sector
must: 

<ul>
  <li>make a commitment to expanding competitive scientific and technical capacity through
    enhanced educational opportunities from pre-school through post-graduate education, </li>
  <li>conduct broad-based planning for technological change, linking education, health,
    industrial, agricultural, environmental and other sectors; </li>
  <li>create technology management systems within and across sectors, to ensure that the
    development, diffusion and use of equipment and procedures are appropriate and effective; </li>
  <li>support research and development in key areas of competitive advantage, and </li>
  <li>create a climate that encourages private-sector investment in research and development .</li>
</ul>

<p>Several economic sectors hold the potential for job creation: trade, tourism,
construction and physical infrastructure, industry, and to a lesser extent agriculture. </p>

<p><em>Trade</em> has historically been a significant aspect of the Palestinian economy.
In the current context, a key potential for job creation lies in an export-oriented
private sector: the size of the Palestinian economy necessitates such an approach, along
with the experience of other developing countries which managed over the past three
decades to achieve high rates of economic growth through the adoption of outward looking
development strategies. The architecture of future external trade relationships will be an
important part of the strategic development vision and will contribute importantly to its
success and to the creation of trade-related jobs. Recognizing the necessity of
integration with world markets, the PA and its Palestinian private sector partners will
continue to utilize the their participation in international organizations to the extent
possible and will strengthen our capacity to conform to international norms, conventions,
trade standards. </p>

<p><em>Tourism</em> can be a significant foreign exchange earner for the Palestinian
economy, as well as a powerful engine of employment. Currently, only one percent of
Palestinian jobs are in the tourism sector. With proper nurturing. the tourism industry
could employ about 10 percent of the available workforce within 5 - 1 0 years. In
addition. the tourism industry generates secondary employment in other sectors, including
for example, agro-industry; construction; equipment, furniture and furnishings
manufacturing; financial services; and handicrafts. Moreover, over the past several years,
donors have contributed importantly to the development of tourist sites and to
strengthening the capacity of Palestinians to manage their tourism industry. To further
develop the tourism sector , improved signage, training staff, improvement of public
utilities where necessary , and expanding of hotel and encouragement of investment in
related tourist facilities are needed. </p>

<p>Since 1994, <em>construction and physical infrastructure development</em> has
contributed significantly to job creation in the Palestinian economy. Although this sector
has been largely dependent on donor funding of capital costs, the economic benefits have
abounded. Construction of housing, public and private sector offices, schools, health
facilities, roads, wastewater and sewerage systems and other large and small-scale
infrastructure projects have resulted in the creation of short- and long-term employment,
improved living conditions, and improved access to education and health care. Future needs
resulting from the implementation of the permenent peace agreement win include housing for
returnees, expanded water resources and needs, safe passage. railroads, expanded harbor
and airport. This will continue to be an important source of employment and economic
growth for the foreseeable future, for although much has been accomplished since 1994,
physical infrastructure needs still abound, including for example in low- and middl~income
housing, regional and local road networks and road systems to external markets, and water
and sanitation systems in both urban and rural areas.</p>

<p>Palestinian industry can be characterized as consisting primarily of relatively small,
mostly family-owned businesses with a small capital base, high utility costs, and ease of
entry . However, there are important factors that have contributed to development of
Palestinian industry in the past, notwithstanding the barriers to such development. These
factors, which will continue to play a key role in industrial development, and therefore
in job creation and economic growth, include: innovative, modern management which results
in, among other benefits, improved quality of products experience in managing productive
enterprises abroad; creative use of limited resources, including inventive adaptation or
development of technologies for use in the manufacturing process, and the entrepreneurial
spirit inherent in Palestinian business community, characterized by extensive
owner-involvement. In the past several years, four industrial estates (zones) have been
established or are in the planning stages, and an industrial zone master plan has been
developed. The types of fields in which Palestinians may have a competitive advantage
include, for example, information technology and communications, microelectronics and
micro electromechanical systems, biotechnology , and environmental-related technologies. </p>

<p>The close link between trade and industrial sectors will figure out prominently in the
Palestinian strategic vision for the future. With the modern and competitive Palestinian
industrial sector geared basically to the tastes and needs of consumers in the regional
and international markets, an innovative development model to help realize this goal will
be at the heart of the future strategy . The modernization of the existing industries,
particularly garment and leather, along with building new high tech industries, will be
emphasized. The vision here is to build an (UAE) Jabal Ali type of industrial trade based
development model. This realization of this vision will be greatly facilitated and
enhanced by the numerous free trade agreements signed between the PA and many countries
around the world, but mainly Europe and North America. The benefits of these trade
agreements will be realized once the present barriers imposed on the Palestinian trade in
the interim period are lifted, and once the free and unfettered access to regional and
international markets is established. </p>

<p>While the potential for job creation in the <em>agriculture </em>sector is rather
limited, there are important strengths on which to build economic growth, including for
example on-going experimentation with high value crops, diverse climatic conditions and
fertile land, and a reasonable level of applied technology . Sustainable agricultura1
development has been of concern for some time, and investments have been made in
experimentation with high value crops, drip agriculture, re-use of treated wastewater ,
science based agriculture, export oriented products, and intensive agriculture. All of
these relate to both improved efficiency in agriculture and to protection and preservation
of natural resources. Areas for expanded development include agro-industry , animal
husbandry and organic agriculture. </p>

<p>(c) <strong><em>Environmental Management: Preserving, Protecting and Sharing Natural
Resources</em></strong></p>

<p>In order to protect and effectively utilize Palestinian natural resources and those we
share with our neighbors, we need to improve our ability to respond to environmental
emergencies-- including development of response plans and protocols; improve data&nbsp;
and information systems; strengthen and sustain management and use of natural resources,
including forestry, stone quarries; develop and promulgate conservation laws related to
biodiversity and pollution, improve systems for the reduction of air and noise pollution,
and reduce the impact of industrial and agricultural development on the environment.
Institutional strengthening in the environmental areas includes preparing consensus-based,
rational regional, rural and urban plan, capacity building for district and municipal
government officials. </p>

<p><em>Water</em> -- fundamental for individual and public health and economic development
-is the scarcest of basic resources. Consequently, its use and management is politically
complex in virtually all parts of the world, and certainly in the Palestinian context. It
is imperative that over the immediate and long term the scarce water resources shared by
all peoples in the Middle East be used judiciously, shared equitably, and maintained
appropriately. Palestinian water share increase as a result of the 1995 agreement need to
be accurately implemented. To this end, it is critical that there be improved efficiency
and effectiveness in water use, including expansion of water conservation projects,
reduced leakages, and improved recycling, and improved quality of service, including
potability of water and sewage collection and treatment. Putting in place an appropriate
regulatory environment for water use, including promulgation of a new Water Law and
related monitoring and information 'systems, will contribute importantly to improved water
resource management, and ultimately to improved availability of and access to water
sources. Creating incentive mechanisms such as performance- based contracting of private
firms has proven to be an effective approach to water distribution.</p>

<p>(d)<strong><em> Social Policy: The Palestinian People as a Fundamental Resource for
Development</em></strong></p>

<p>Difficult social issues must be considered, for they determine, to a large extent, the
degree to which all Palestinians share the fruits of development. Some of those that need
to be considered -which parallel those in virtually all societies - include for
example&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>equality and civil rights protection in general and gender equality in particular ,</li>
  <li>poverty reduction and the role of the public sector in providing a social safety net in
    areas such&nbsp;&nbsp; as health, pension, income support, and housing,</li>
  <li>human resources development in part to ensure effective Palestinian participation in the
    global&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marketplace, and </li>
  <li>special needs of most affected population, traumatized, rehabilitation and training of
    ex-detainees, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two areas fundamental for both economic growth and development and for social stability
are <em>education and health</em>. In education, its expected that the present 6.7 percent
annual addition to school enrollment will increase with influx of Palestinian returnees
after the signing of the permanent peace agreement. Therefore, a key objective over the
next several years will be improving <em>access</em>, including maintaining net enrollment
for grades 1-6, increasing enrollment for grades 7 -12, continue aggressive school
building so as to keep class sizes low and end the double shifting, and providing
educational and training opportunities for out-of-school youth. However, it is critical
that the quality of education continues to improve, as measured by students.learning
achievements and participation in post-secondary education. This is crucial if the
Palestinian development vision to be realized. The introduction of ,science, technology ,
and math courses in the curriculum is of utmost importance in this regard. Finally,
educational planning and services at all levels must take into account both future human
resources needs as driven by both Palestinian economic changes and the global marketplace,
and the special needs of those with physical or mental health disabilities. </p>

<p>In health, there is a need to continue building the public health and health service
delivery systems, including health infrastructure at all levels (primary, secondary and
tertiary care), addressing urgent educational needs of health care practitioners, and
strengthening coordination and improving quality of services among public, NGO, private
sector&nbsp; and UNRWA service delivery programs. Finally, expanding health insurance
toward universal coverage and ensuring access to basic health care for all on a
sustainable basis has been, and continues to be, a fundamental goal of the PA in the
health sector. Improving efficiency in both education and health is critical, including in
the areas of capital investments, and maintenance of schools and health facilities,
contracting for services where appropriate, and reducing unnecessary or inappropriate
medical care. </p>

<p><big>IV. PREPARING THE PALESTINIAN STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN</big></p>

<p>The PSDP is designed to focus on the strategic allocation of resources within and
across sectors, based on agreed-upon economic and social priorities. The PA, in its
commitment to integrated, strategic planning toward sustainable development, intends to
ensure that the PSDP is developed in the most thorough, participatory manner possible.
This will include extensive involvement of PA agencies, district and municipal leaders,
the private sector agents, and the civil society insofar as possible, using established
techniques for participatory planning. This is the only way to ensure that this critical
foundation document will reflect the needs of the Palestinian people,</p>

<p>utilize its resources in the most effective manner, and take into account the
fundamental strategic considerations that will underlie the Palestinian planning process.
The PSDP will provide strategic direction for five years and a preliminary program for the
succeeding five years. Specifically, the PSDP will be a comprehensive document that
includes: 

<ul>
  <li>A discussion of strategic direction for Palestinian development, </li>
  <li>A presentation of the economic framework on which such development will be based for the
    to-year period of the PSDP </li>
  <li>A synthesis of key national policies relevant to development </li>
  <li>Cross-sectoral and sectoral baseline data and information </li>
  <li>Goals, objectives, key targets/benchmarks and strategies for national cross-sectoral
    programs, including a presentation of priority areas among them </li>
  <li>A summary of goals, objectives, key targets/benchmarks and strategies for sectoral
    programs, including a presentation of priority areas within the sectors</li>
  <li>Guidelines for selection criteria to be used by ministries in setting priorities for
    sectoral programs and projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the PSDP will include gross estimates of the capital and recurrent costs of the
plan for the first five years, the PSDP is not intended as a substitute for the PDP ,
which will continue to be updated annually and include specific project and budgetary
information. </p>

<p>Since the first presentation of the framework for the PSDP in February 1999, there have
been important accomplishments in the Palestinian planning process on which it will build.
Several of these are highlighted below. 

<ul>
  <li>Long term plans have been prepared by Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education.
    Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, and
    by the Palestinian Water Authority. These plans have been developed by the respective
    public entity to varying degrees in cooperation with relevant NGOs and with involvement of
    the respective Sector Working Group. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Since the spring of 1999, Palestinian ministries and other public institutions have been
    engaged in the process of adapting the <em>Comprehensive Development Framework</em> (CDF)
    to meet Palestinian development planning needs. The process of preparing CDF sector
    matrices has served as a catalyst for addressing the interdependence of all elements of
    development within the sectors, for exploring opportunities for efficient integration of
    programs and projects, for discussion of relative priorities within these sectors. The
    resulting documents - several of which are near completion -- clearly synthesize
    development issues and plans at the sectoral level in ten key sectors: basic and secondary
    education and training, energy, the environment, health, local government, public
    administration, rural strategy, social protection, transportation, and water and
    wastewater . To varying degrees, there has been involvement in this process by NGOs and
    other parts of civil society, with broad consultative fora planned at a later stage.
    Moreover , existing local aid coordination structures -including for example the Sector
    Working Groups - have been used effectively to discuss CDF sector matrices with the donor
    community and to engage donors as partners in important sector policy dialogue. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Several broad-based policy oriented initiatives have either begun or have been
    completed, including for example: the Macroeconomic Policy Committee (MPC), the Higher
    National Committee for Institutional Development (HNCID), and cross-sectoral,
    issue-specific planning activities such as those related to poverty reduction and gender
    equality, and regional physical infrastructure including roads ,and water . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Initial work - albeit embryonic - bas begun on <em>multi-sectoral planning</em>. For
    example, the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Higher Education. and Ministry of Labor
    have initiated collaboration on planning for human resources development in a Sector-wide
    Approach (SWA). In education and health, there have been discussions of approaches to
    services integration related to early childhood development and to school health. By early
    June, the process of addressing additional cross-sectoral issues, policies and programs in
    education and health will be underway and win be initiated in at least two other sectors
    (most likely industry and the environment). MOPIC is currently coordinating the
    preparation of a rural development strategy with several key ministries and NGOs. In the
    critical area of child development, MOPIC has worked with more than a dozen ministries and
    numerous NGOs to prepare a National Plan for Child Development. </li>
</ul>

<p>The PSDP will both build upon these planning achievements and others in the public and
private sectors (including, for example, evaluation reports of existing programs and
projects), and will in the future inform these and other policy development and planning
processes. It is critical that throughout this process, the coordination that has been
initiated between and among ministries, relevant NGOs, the private sector, district and
municipal governments, and donors continue. The various venues that have been in place
since the establishment of the PA ( e.g., No0 committees advising ministries, Sector
Working Groups) and those that are more recent (e.g., the Macroeconomic Policy Committee
and the Higher National Committee for Institutional Development) will be important sources
of information and dialogue for the PSDP preparation process. </p>

<p>Existing sectoral plans and CDF matrices have already yielded important information to
inform the process of identifying development themes or issues that are common among two
or more sectors; these include, for example, 

<ul>
  <li>early childhood development that cuts across health, education and social protection; </li>
  <li>protection of natural resources, that intersects multiple sectors including environment,
    agriculture, industry , health and education. water and wastewater;</li>
  <li>gender equality that also intersects multiple sectors including health, education,
    social protection, and labor;</li>
  <li>private sector-led economic growth that intersects education, industry , labor , health
    and other areas. </li>
</ul>

<p><big>V. CONTINUING ON THE PATHWAY TOWARD DEFINING AND ACHIEVING THE VISION</big></p>

<p>Within the coming months, we expect to have the overall structure of the vision and the
PSDP defined, including preliminary identification of short-term investment and technical
assistance options over a transitional period. Continued development of the PSDP will take
place in stages over the next 12 months. By the end of2000, there win be available a draft
PSDP that can be used as a basis for long-range planning and investment decisions across
and within most sectors. Dissemination of the final document, incorporating our
comprehensive Palestinian vision, is planned for June 2001. It cannot be overemphasized
that the PDSP must, at this critical juncture of&nbsp; moving toward permanent status
negotiations, take into account not only those issues inherent in sustainable development
(e.g., economic factors, physical infrastructure, and social needs) but also issues that
impact on sustainable development. Among these issues that are unique to Palestinian
society are the anticipated influx of returnees, the establishment and operation of a safe
passage between the West Bank and Gaza. and effective utilization of shared water
resources. The dynamic nature of the negotiation process, and the compelling development
needs of our people, necessitate our proceeding with preparation of the PSDP
notwithstanding final solutions of these issues. It is assumed that this critical planning
document will be an evolutionary one that can be revised to take into account changing
political and economic realities. </p>

<p>In the meantime, we continue to refine our public policies with and across sectors, and
to work with NGOs and the private sector to identify priority areas for our own resource
allocation decisions and for potential donor investment. In the near future, the types of
investment categories that are viewed as linked inextricably to our emerging vision, and
that make the most effective use of our resources, are likely to include, for example: 

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure-housing, road networks, transportation linkage between the West Bank and
    Gaza, capital costs for the seat of government, water and wastewater resource development,
    schools, health facilities, and export-oriented infrastructure;</li>
  <li>Capacity building -in health and education. management of local governments, corporate
    governance,&nbsp; regional, rural and urban, management information systems for the public
    and private sectors; </li>
  <li>Enabling environment for private sector investment-including appropriate legal and
    regulatory instruments and mechanisms, financial intermediation and financial systems; </li>
  <li>Employment and job creation-- including training and other support facilities and
    infrastructure in key areas of potential growth such as information technology and
    software development, trade, agro-industry , light manufacturing, tourism, and other
    service industries; and </li>
  <li>Poverty alleviation- including strengthened social service mechanisms, access to
    resources to improve individual capacity to participate in the productive economy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Precise quantification of the investment needs in these areas is extraordinarily
complex and made more so by the significant unknowns in the Palestinian context. For
example, the social service and infrastructure needs of displaced persons who will
eventually return home as a result of the peace agreement is an &quot;unknown&quot; that,
although possibly requiring substantial economic investment, cannot be fully planned until
a final agreement has been reached. The constriction needs include housing ( and related
infrastructure) and additional schools and health facilities. Social support where
necessary , and job creation win also be demands on both the public and private sectors.
In addition, the degree of intensity of medium and long-range planning has varied by
sector, and both inter- ,and intra-sectoral planning in many areas is in part contingent
on political negotiations. </p>

<p>Describing an overall vision for a people is no small task. Articulating a
consensus-based vision in the context of a specific, comprehensive plan requires
steadfastness, time, a willingness make difficult trade-offs, and to proceed through a
participatory process that is often burdensome but that renders the result invaluable. Our
vision -that 'Can be provisionally expressed as moving toward development of a democratic
society that balances sustainable economic growth with equitable social and economic
opportunities-- is based on a solid foundation. The resources that comprise this
found~tion for Palestinian development -- the <em>Palestinian people</em>, the
extraordinary cultural heritage, significant <em>natural resources</em>, the <em>strategic
location</em> of the area, and <em>favorable terms of trade</em>-are critical for economic
and social development. 'Over the coming months and years we look forward to working with
our donor partners to plan wise public 'sector ivestments, to make the most appropriate
and effective use of our resources, and to create an enabling environment for private
sector investment. This will contribute significantly to achieving our vision. which we
feel confident is shared by all.</p>
