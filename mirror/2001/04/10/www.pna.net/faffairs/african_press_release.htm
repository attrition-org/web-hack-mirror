<p><strong><font color="#B80000">Press Release</font></strong></p>

<p>We Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, meeting at the
36th Session of the Assembly in Lome, Togo from 10-12 July 2000 have taken note of the
important tripartite meeting currently being held in the United States, to put the Middle
East process back on track.</p>

<p>We&nbsp; welcome the participation of Chairman Yasser Arafat and the Prime Minister
Barak in these direct talks and hope that their efforts will create the environment for
success.</p>

<p>In this connection, we the heads of State and Government express the&nbsp; hope that
talks will lead to a comprehensive Agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis
covering all pending issues in particular, Jerusalem and the refugees.</p>

<p>We therefore call upon the three leaders to spare no effort in bringing the talks to a
successful conclusion and the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East
and the realization of the right to self-determination by the Palestinians and the
establishment of their own state in Palestine.</p>

<p>We wish to also express our gratitude to President Bill Clinton in particular, for his
abiding interest in these talks and for showing courage and leadership at this critical
junction in the Middle East peace process.</p>

<p>Lome, Togo<br>
July 11, 2000</p>
