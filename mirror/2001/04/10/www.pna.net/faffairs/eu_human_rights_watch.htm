<ol type="I">
  <li>ISRAEL</li>
</ol>

<p>The new&nbsp; government of Israel which has been in power since July 1999, is
currently reviewing Israeli legislation and practice in the field of human rights. The
ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court against the use of so-called '&quot;moderate physical
pressure&quot; has contributed to this development. It remains to be seen whether this
will translate into improvements of the human rights situation on the ground.</p>

<p>On 6 September the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that various forms of interrogation
methods (including hooding, shackling, sleep deprivation and the placing of detainees in
painful positions for several hours at a time) are illegal. (Previous to the 6 September
ruling, within the period under review, these methods were used against Palestinian
prisoners of the Israeli security service, the GSS). The Supreme Court further ruled that
there is no legal basis for applying physical pressure on suspects. To date the ruling has
been observed, although there are legislative efforts to legalize &quot;physical
pressure&quot; in certain circumstances. The Israeli Minister of Justice has declared his
opposition to any legislative initiative which would enable interrogators to apply
&quot;physical pressure&quot; on detainees. </p>

<p>The number of Palestinians who died at the hands of the Israeli security forces was
during this period, as in the last, extremely low: only one death was reported. It is not
obvious that this resulted from any change in the Israeli security forces' policy towards
the use of lethal force, rather than from the absence of serious unrest among
Palestinians. </p>

<p>On 17 October the Israeli Minister of the Interior announced that the Israeli
government would no longer demand proof of seven years of residency in Jerusalem for
Palestinians to receive the right to continue living and working there. They will be
expected instead to demonstrate an appropriate link with the city. This change of policy
has not yet been put into effect. It is unclear what will constitute an appropriate link
with Jerusalem. No such restriction applies to Israeli residents of East or West
Jerusalem. </p>

<p>Eight Palestinian houses were demolished by the Israeli authorities for lack of
building permission. The lower number of demolitions appears to mark a welcome change in
the Israeli government's policy on demolitions. No changes however have been made in the
system by which building permission is granted and refused, and which makes permission
extremely difficult and expensive to acquire. Meanwhile housing units for Israelis
continued to be built on land in the Occupied Territories confiscated from Palestinians:
further details are provided in the separate Settlements Watch. </p>

<p>Closure was imposed on the Occupied Territories for 6 days during this period, as a
precaution against terrorist attacks during Jewish holidays. Safe passage between Gaza and
the West Bank, whose southern route was opened on 25 October, has increased two-way access
for Palestinians between the two regions, with 15,000 permits issued so far.</p>

<p>The number of Palestinian administrative detainees held in Israeli prisons without
trial has decreased from 72 to 20 during the period in question. The Israeli Justice
Minister has indicated that he favors allowing the state of emergency, which has existed
in Israel since 1948, to lapse, which would imply discontinuing the use of administrative
detention. The number of Lebanese administrative detainees remains unchanged at 21.</p>

<p>II CONDUCT OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY </p>

<p>The Palestinians cannot ratify international human rights instruments, such as the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Convention Against Torture, as
Palestine is not an independent state, and the Palestinian Authority (PA) is forbidden by
the terms of the Oslo Agreement from doing so. But we recall that: 

<ul>
  <li>President Arafat has publicly stated on several occasions that the P A is committed to
    respecting all internationally recognized human rights standards and to incorporating them
    fully into Palestinian Law. For example he spoke to this effect at the Palestinian
    Legislative Council on 7 March 1998. </li>
  <li>The PA/PLO is a signatory to the Barcelona Declaration, whose basic principles include
    respect for the democratic process and for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>The situation in the areas under full control of the PA continues to fall short of
required human rights standards.</p>

<p>Torture is frequent in Palestinian prisons and detention centers. </p>

<p>At least two hundred people continue in detention without trial, a large number of whom
have been detained for over a year. Persons accused of tax evasion and fraud have again
been tried in </p>

<p>State Security Courts during this period. </p>

<p>No death sentences were carried out during this period, although one was passed.</p>

<p>A journalist, Maher AI-Dasouqi, was detained in September for over two weeks, charged
with possession of material inciting against the Palestinian Authority. Dr Iyad al-Saaaj,
director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, was summoned for questioning in
August after writing an article critical of the Authority for the magazine of a&nbsp;
human rights group. </p>

<p>Detainees whose release has been ordered by the Palestinian Supreme Court remain in
many cases still in detention. An Attorney General (Zuheir al Sourani) has been appointed
but no Supreme Judicial Council has been set up; instead responsibility for supervision of
judges in Gaza was given to the President of the Gaza High Court of Justice. </p>

<p>Democratic municipal elections remain overdue. The Basic Law, which would enshrine
democratic norms and human rights standards in law, has not yet been ratified by Yasser
Arafat although work continues on drafting of a Palestinian constitution. </p>

<p>A report issued by a taskforce sponsored by the US non-governmental organization the
Council on Foreign Relations in July praised certain aspects of the Palestinian
Authority's performance, while proposing, among other recommendations: 

<ul>
  <li>A formal constitution or Basic Law; </li>
  <li>A more effective Legislative Council; </li>
  <li>A more independent judicial system; </li>
  <li>Civilian oversight for the security forces;</li>
  <li>The abolition of State Security Courts; and</li>
  <li>Greater financial transparency.</li>
</ul>
