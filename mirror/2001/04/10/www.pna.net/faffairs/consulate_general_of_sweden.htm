<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lindh and Klingvall on the situation in the Middle East</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reports of this week&#146;s dramatic events in the occupied
Palestinian areas and Lebanon are very alarming&#148;, says the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Anna Lindh. &#147;The situation is very serious for the peace process. Within the
UN and the EU we must do all that we can to put a stop to the violence and to get the
parties back to the negotiating table.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The events of the weekend, and especially the capture of their
Israeli soldiers show that there is a grate risk that the conflict will proliferate. An
increase in violence on the Lebanese border may have serious consequences for the whole
region. It is therefore good news that the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and the
Secretary-General and high representative of the European Council, Javier Solana, have
gone to the region&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The extreme violence used by the Israeli side goes far beyond the
bounds of what is acceptable demonstrators with the usual police methods but in too many
cases uses heavy military units with loaded ammunition. This is contravention of
humanitarian law. The ambulances and staff of the Red Cross and Red Crescent have been
shot at. These organization&#146;s ability to work should not be hindered,&#148; says Anna
Lindh.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The humanitarian situation on the West Bank and in Gaza is very
critical,&#148; says the Minister for Development Cooperation, Maj-Inger Kingvall.
&#147;There is an acute shortage of medical equipment and ambulances in the medical sector
Sweden is therefor prepared to contribute humanitarian support which will be canalized
through Swedish non-governmental organizations and UNRWA (the UN body for Palestinian
refugees). Sweden contributes SEK 3 million to the West Bank/Gaza and SEK I million to
Lebanon through its yearly allocation to the International Rd Cross. Special support of
SEK I million have now been granted to Diakonia for the West Bank/ Gaza. In addition we
are preparing to allocate an extra grant to UNRWA, in addition to our ordinary support of
SEK 160 million a year. These organizations not only have long experience of working in
the region; they also have a well- functioning infrastructure on the spot. Help will reach
those needing it immediately,&#148; says Maj-Inger Klingvall.</p>
