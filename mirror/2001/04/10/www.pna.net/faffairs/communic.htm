<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian National Authority and the Ministry of Planning and
International Cooperation condemn in the strongest terms the violent incidents which have
marred the aftermath of the French Prime minister's otherwise successful visit to Birzeit
University. We extend our most sincere apologies to the French Prime minister, Mr. Lionel
Jospin, personally, to the distinguished delegation accompanying him, as well as to the
friendly French government and people for these unacceptable incidents. A thorough inquiry
will be conducted to identify the perpetrators of violence and take all the necessary
legal measures against them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We wish to reaffirm on this dramatic occasion our long-standing friendship
with France, its successive governments and its people, who have stood by the side of our
people's struggle for his national rights, both on their own and within the European
context for more than three decades. France today, while extending to the Palestinian
people an invaluable economic and technical assistance, also stands at the forefront of
the current international efforts to move the stalled peace-process forward, and we are
deeply grateful for this involvement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We also wish to attract attention to the fact that Birzeit University is
located in an occupied Palestinian area over which Palestinian security forces have no
control, and to which they have no access, which accounts for the weakness of the
protection dispositive available on the spot. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We reiterate our apology and express the confidence that these deplorable
incidents will not be able to jeopardize the solid ties of friendship, trust and
cooperation between France and Palestine. </p>
