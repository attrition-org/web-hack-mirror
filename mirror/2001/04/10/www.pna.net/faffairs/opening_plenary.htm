European Parliament, Strasbourg<br>
Intervention of Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL)<br>

Mrs President,<br>
Yesterday, I came back from Palestine and Gaza, where, on Saturday, I attended the plenary
session of the Palestinian Legislative Council that was held for the first time for six
months. This meeting took place under certain conditions: the Palestinians members could
only enter Gaza in Israeli government cars and they were not allowed to use their own
cars. They were searched and some of them were unable to attend due to the closure of the
borders of the Palestinians territories.<br>
During the night of the 7th Israeli soldiers hermetically closed 33 Palestinian villages
(between Ramallah and Birzeit). They dug trenches, destroyed over 400 metres of the street
and put tanks into position. <br>
More then 65,000 people are blocked inside these villages.<br>
These are actions that we cannot condone and we feel it is necessary to make our voices
heard.<br>
I ask the President to take action with Mr Solana in order to protest against the closure
of the University of Birzeit. The students and teachers were not responsible for any
shooting from Birzeit as they were only there to study.<br>
I believe the situation is urgent and requires an immediate response. Israel must not be
allowed to continue to violate the Geneva Convention and other International Conventions
and to perpetuate these collective and inhuman punishments.<br>
I refuse action of &nbsp;terrorism by single Palestinians or by organisations. However,
there is no justification &nbsp;to &nbsp;collective punishments, &nbsp;they look to be a
form of tribal revenge.<br>
I ask the President to promote and support a protest to the Israeli government.
Furthermore, I ask her to urge Mr Solana to intervene immediately to end the closure of
the occupied territories, to put a stop to the collective punishment of the Palestinian
population, to re-open Birzeit, it's university and villages and to restore the people's
right to live and study.<br>
