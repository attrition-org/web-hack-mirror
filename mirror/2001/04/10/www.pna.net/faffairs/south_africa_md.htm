<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">The department of the Foreign Affairs once again expresses its profound
concern at the worsening and downward spiraling of the overall political and security
situation in the Middle East. The extremely negative recent developments in the Middle
East are not in the interest of the Peoples. Leaders and States of the Region nor are they
in the interest of world peace and security.</p>

<p align="justify">In this regard the department of the Foreign Affairs notes with keen
interest the decisions of the Arab Summit held on 21 and 22 October 2000 in Cairo, Egypt.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;The department of the Foreign Affairs has also noted with sharp
interest the deliberations and decisions of the Fifth Special Session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights held on 17 to 19 October 2000, in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

<p align="justify">The department of the Foreign Affairs welcomes and fully endorses the
outcome of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on
the situation in the Middle East held on 20 October 2000.</p>

<p align="justify">In the light of continuing excessive and disproportionate use of force
by Israel, the department of the Foreign Affairs calls for the provision of international
protection, under the auspices of the United Nations, to Palestinians under Israeli
occupation.</p>

<p align="justify">The department of the Foreign Affairs further calls for the institution
of an international mechanism for the establishment of truth regarding the tragic events
since 29 September 2000.</p>

<p align="justify">The department of the Foreign Affairs categorically condemns the
unlawful and punitive Israeli practices of collective punishment including the prevention
of the airlifting of wounded Palestinians from Gaza Airport and the use of high-tech
military equipment against Palestinian residential areas.</p>

<p align="justify">The growing culture of political impunity, as represented by the events
of 28 September 2000, represents a dire threat to the prospect of a peaceful resolution to
the Middle East Crisis and should be combated through appropriate international
mechanisms.</p>

<p align="justify">The department of the Foreign Affairs condemns the activities of bands
of armed civilians opposed to the negotiation process, both on the Israeli and the
Palestinian sides.</p>

<p align="justify">The department of the Foreign Affairs calls for the immediate and
complete cession of a,, hostilities in order to create a climate conductive to the
resumption of negotiations.</p>
