<p align="left"><font color="#B80000"><strong>Statement by the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Ireland , Mr. Brian Cowen T.D.,<br>
on violence in Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank </strong></font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;I am deeply concerned at the events which have taken place today in
the West Bank and Gaza. Today&#146;s events began with brutal murder of the Israeli
soldiers being held in a police station in Ramallah and quickly to ever greater levels of
violence.</p>

<p align="left">&#147;This follows on two weeks of disturbances which have left one
hundred dead and possibly thousands injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;This Government deplore the loss of life which has taken place and I
have already extended my deepest sympathy to the families of those who were killed as well
as to those who were injured. Equally, I offer my sympathy to all the victims of
today&#146;s violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&#147;I renew my call on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and
to do everything in their power to avoid further escalation and to try to restore calm.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&#147;The danger that this conflict might extend further has to be
averted.</p>

<p align="left">&#147;Despite the tragic events of today and the past two weeks, it is
vitally important that Israelis and Palestinians should strive to renew the Peace Process.
The negotiations towards a comprehensive peace settlement offer the only hope that such
confrontations and loss of life can be avoided in the future</p>

<p align="left">&#147;The Taoiseach and I will be discussing the current situation at the
European Council tomorrow.</p>

<p align="left">&#147;The Government also expresses regret at the death of at least four
American sailors in a terrorist attack on a US naval vessel near Aden earlier today.&#148;</p>
