PRESS RELEASE<br>
<br>
</strong>29.10.2000<br>

<br>
Severe conclusions from the analysis of the injuries sustained by Palestinian citizens of
Israel during the October confrontations<br>
within the &#145;Green Line&#146;<br>
<br>
<br>
Official data from &#145;Rambam&#146; hospital in Haifa &#150; the main hospital in the
north of Israel &#150; regarding Arab citizens of Israel<br>
admitted to the hospital during the October confrontations in the north of Israel, were
analyzed by PHR&#150;Israel expert Dr. Zeev<br>
Wiener:<br>
<br>
<br>
According to Dr. Wiener, it is surprising that so many of the injuries are in the upper
part of the body. Bullets were extracted<br>
from the bodies of the injured, apparently indicating direct fire, rather than injuries
from ricochets. <br>
<br>
<br>
32 injured civilians were admitted to the emergency room. <br>
4 were discharged and we have no further information regarding their condition.<br>
28 were hospitalized, with 30 injuries (two had more than one injury). <br>
2 died of their injuries.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Of those admitted, there were:<br>
<br>
10 head or face injuries<br>
11 chest injuries<br>
9 arm/leg injuries<br>
<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that these data are partial, and somewhat biased, since only the most
serious injuries were<br>
sent to Rambam hospital &#150; the large number of seriously injured and the severity of
the injuries suffice to arouse<br>
suspicion, that in many cases there was massive shooting directed toward civilians, and
that possibly sniper<br>
fire was employed &#150; rather than warning fire intended to scatter the demonstrations.<br>
<br>
These data correspond to testimonies given by several of the injured to PHR&#150;Israel,
according to which sniper<br>
fire was employed against demonstrators.<br>
<br>
In light of the above, Physicians for Human Rights&#150;Israel has sent a message to the
Minister of Internal Security,<br>
Prof. Shlomo Ben-Ami, in which we demand to know:<br>
<br>
What were the firing instructions given to Israeli Police and Border Police forces, and
did the forces act<br>
according to these regulations? <br>
Was sniper fire employed? If so, we demand to know why sniper fire was employed against<br>
demonstrating civilians, who are citizens of Israel. <br>
<br>

PHR-ISRAEL: PRESS RELEASE<br>
<br>
29.10.00<br>
<br>
<br>
PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS&#150;ISRAEL condemns an attack by Israeli civilians directed<br>
against a Palestinian hospital, and demands that the Prime Minister publicly call for
respect of<br>
medical institutions and human life.<br>
<br>
This morning at 5:30 am a GMC vehicle stopped opposite the gate of &#145;Augusta
Victoria&#146; Hospital in East<br>
Jerusalem. One of its three passengers, identified as Jewish by their clothes, got out of
the vehicle, directed a<br>
gun at the entrance to the hospital, and shot two gunshots at the hospital guard.<br>
<br>
PHR&#150;Israel has issued a message to the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, demanding
that he and his<br>
government publicly call to civilians and military forces alike in Israel, to protect the
neutrality of medical<br>
personnel and institutions, especially at times of tension and conflict, when basic human
principles must be<br>
observed.<br>
<br>
We are aware that a police investigation has commenced regarding this event, but in our
opinion this is not<br>
sufficient. In order to ensure that such a case does not repeat itself, there is need of
an unequivocal message<br>
from the Israeli government condemning such conduct and protecting medical institutions
and human life itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
If even medical institutions are damaged today, what moral values can remain?</p>
