incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1 of this Article, and:<br>

working days following referral for such consultation.<br>
With reference to practices incompatible with paragraph 1 (iii) of this Article, such
appropriate measures, when the GATT is applicable to them, may only be adopted in
accordance with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by GATT or by any other
