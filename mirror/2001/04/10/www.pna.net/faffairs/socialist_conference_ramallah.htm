<br>
</p>

<p align="left">The Socialist International Middle East Committee, SIMEC, having met in
Ramallah and Tel-Aviv on 14-15 May 1997, declares:<br>
</p>

<p align="left">-SIMEC deeply regrets the stalemate in the Middle East peace process. Lack
of progress entails a clear risk of further escalation of violence in the region and
undermining of the forces of peace. Every effort must now be made to revitalize that
process.</p>

<p align="left">-The Oslo Accords must be respected and fully implemented by both parties.</p>

<p align="left">-Israel has a special responsibility to bring the peace process back on
track by not continuing with the construction of Har Homa. SIMEC condemns the settlement
policies of the present Israeli government which endangers the peace process Israel must
also undertake to fulfil its obligations regarding the safe passage between Gaza and the
West Bank, the operation of Gaza airport, the construction of the Gaza port, the release
of prisoners and further redeployment.</p>

<p align="left">- A serious and constructive beginning of permanent status negotiations to
achieve a durable and mutually acceptable peace between the Israeli and Palestinian people
on the basis of the implementation of security council resolutions 242 and 338 which
embody the principle of land for peace must be initiated. The committee emphasizes the
need to engage serious dialogue on all outstanding issues.</p>

<p align="left">-Palestinians and Israel security cooperation must be resumed under any
circumstances security is a common concern for all.</p>

<p align="left">- Suitable confidence - building measures must be devised so that the
parties can gradually begin to develop a minimum of confidence necessary to re launch the
negotiations.</p>

<p align="left">- The international community has a vital stake in the future development
of the Middle East the United States and the European Union and all interested parties are
urged to redouble their efforts to bring the parties back to the negotiating table and to
ensure momentum in the negotiation</p>

<p align="left">- The Israeli - Syrian and Israeli - Lebanese negotiations on the basis of
security council resolutions 242 and 425 have to be resumed.</p>

<p align="left">- International economic assistance in support of the Palestinian
Authority must be continued and increased as a vital contribution to the construction of a
viable and democratic society respectful of fundamental human rights in the Palestinian
areas.</p>

<p align="left">- SIMEC congratulates the Congress of the Israel Labor Party which decided
to recognize the proposition of the creation of a Palestinian state. SIMEC also refers to
the long standing decision of Mapam / Meretz in this respect .</p>

<p align="left">- The Socialist International Middle East Committee, having met these two
days in Ramallah and Tel Aviv recalling its longstanding commitment to and historic role
in bringing together the parties in the peace process, renews, at this critical stage, its
firm intention to continue working for a just and lasting peace in the region.</p>
