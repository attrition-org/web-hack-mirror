</strong></font><br>
Yesterday morning the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) fired a stun grenade towards a
delegation from Amnesty International, while they visited partially destroyed homes near
Salaheddin Gate.&nbsp; The delegates also toured a number of other flashpoints, including
homes in the Brazil Quarter, and the area around Morag settlement.<br>
In addition, they visited the families of two martyrs, Jamal Abdul Raziq and Hani Al-Sufi,
who were assassinated by the IOF.&nbsp; Members of the delegation told journalists that
their visit is part of their overall effort to investigate the situation on the ground,
and the living conditions of the Palestinian people.&nbsp; They described the attack
against them as, &quot;shameful.&quot; <br>
This attack is not the first of its kind.&nbsp; The delegation of the UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, was also targeted by the IOF. The Amnesty members saw the
scope and nature of the human rights abuses perpetrated against the Palestinian people,
especially those residing near Israeli military positions and settlements.<br>
