Introduction<br>
The Israeli authorities have continued to pursue measures that are&nbsp; violations of
international humanitarian law in the occupied palestinian&nbsp; territories. In the past
week, Israeli security forces have deployed &nbsp; excessive lethal force against
Palestinian civilians, attacked residential areas, and continued the closure and
encirclement of Palestinian towns and villages which has caused enormous social and
economic dislocation.<br>
<br>
 Violating the right to life<br>
<br>
Mohammad Ghanim, 75, from Silet el Thahir/Jinin, died due to severe teargas &nbsp;
inhalation on January 1, 2001. According to information available to LAW, &nbsp; Israeli
soldiers and Israeli settlers from Hoamish opened fire at residents &nbsp; of Silet el
Thahir. As a result of a tear gas canister fired in the&nbsp; direction of Ghanim, he was
overcome by its fumes and later died. </p>

<p>The cause of death was confirmed by hospital reports.<br>

northern and southern districts;<br>
2. Israel closed the same roads on January 14, 2001;<br>
3. On January 15, Israel closed Gaza International Airport;<br>
4. Rafah border crossing was also closed. (Israel took these arbitrary&nbsp; measures 2-4

blocks on roads leading to farms;<br>

placed additional concrete blocks and barricades on the roads.<br>
<br>
 Arrests<br>
<br>
On January 14, 2001, Israeli forces broke into Mohammad and Ameer Jafar&#146;s&nbsp; home
in el sawahri el Sharkiyi/Jerusalem. They arrested Abed Jafar and his&nbsp; 15-year-old
daughter Shadya, Ameer and his 34-year-old son Mohammad. <br>
Shadya&nbsp; is currently held in custody at the Russian Compound and Mohammad is &nbsp;
detained at Kfar Atsyun. Abdul Kader Jafar, 44, told LAW that his uncle &nbsp; Ameer, who
is a diabetic, was taken to Hadassa hospital on the night of his &nbsp; arrest. Ameer
supports a 17-member-family.<br>
<br>
In a separate incident, Israel prohibited Tamer Idrees, 15, a resident of&nbsp; the Old
City of Jerusalem from entering the Old City for two weeks. </p>

<p>Idrees&nbsp;&nbsp; was arrested on January 2, while in the Jewish Quarter. He was
released on&nbsp; January 11, 2001. Sabri el Najar, 40, from Khan Yunis, was arrested and
&nbsp; taken to an unknown destination.<br>
<br>
Eight hundred Palestinians have been arrested since the beginning of the&nbsp; current
Intifada; 520 are still detained.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Settlers&#146; assaults<br>
<br>
In the aftermath of killing of an Israeli settler in Gaza, settlers from&nbsp; Kfar Yam,
Nitsar Hazani, and Neve Dakalim settlements assaulted Palestinians&nbsp; and Palestinian
properties in Khan Yunis. They destroyed greenhouses,&nbsp; uprooted plants, attacked
residences, and terrorized the population. Israeli&nbsp; soldiers turned a blind eye to
the settlers&#146; rampage. The settlers also<br>
destroyed the homes of Ibraheem el Laham and el Sayid el Najar.<br>
<br>
On January 15, Israeli settlers opened fire at a Palestinian vehicle&nbsp; wounding
Mahmoud Sawan and Nasir Jaber from Kufur Lakif. Nasir Jaber told&nbsp; LAW that a white
GMC opened fire at the vehicle he was sitting in, wounding&nbsp; him and Mahmoud Sawan. <br>
<br>
The Israeli authorities allowed settlers to patrol in Israeli controlled&nbsp; Hebron.
Israel Radio stated that such patrols would be under Israeli police&nbsp; supervision and
include settlers who had completed their national service.<br>
<br>
Despite repeated declarations from the United Nations and international&nbsp; human rights
organizations, Israel continues to use lethal force against&nbsp; unarmed civilians. LAW
has stressed repeatedly over the period of the&nbsp; current Intifada that such acts
constitute crimes of war. The intentional&nbsp; killing of a resident of occupied
territory in circumstance that are not&nbsp; life threatening to the army of occupation is
willful killing and thus&nbsp; constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention
(art. 146,147).<br>
Moreover, article 32 of the convention stipulates:<br>
<br>
&#147;The High Contracting Parties specifically agree that each of them is &nbsp;
prohibited from taking any measure of such a character as to cause the &nbsp; physical
suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands. The &nbsp; prohibition
applies not only to murder, torture&#133;but also to any other &nbsp; measures of
brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents.&#148;<br>
<br>
In light of the enormous loss of life, with most of those killed being&nbsp; unarmed
Palestinian civilians, LAW calls on the High&nbsp; contracting parties to&nbsp; the Fourth
Geneva Convention to abide by their article 1 obligation and&nbsp; ensure Israel&#146;s
adherence to the Convention&#146;s provisions pertinent to&nbsp; territories that are
under belligerent occupation.<br>
