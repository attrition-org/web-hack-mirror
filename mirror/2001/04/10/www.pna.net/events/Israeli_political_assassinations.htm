legal campaign against Israeli political assassinations</b> <br>
</font><br>
In light of the recent Israeli campaign against Palestinian activists and prominent
political figures, through assassinations and extra judicial killings, MIFTAH hosted a
meeting, at the request of Palestinian Minister of Culture and Information, Mr. Yasser
Abed Rabbo, to mobilize Palestinian efforts in holding Israel legally accountable before
international courts. <br>
The preparatory meeting was held at MIFTAH on Monday January 15</font><sup><font size="1">th</font></sup><font
size="3">, 2000, with the participation of Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, Mr. Yasser Abed Rabbo,
prominent Palestinian experts in the fields of international and humanitarian law, as well
as representatives of various Palestinian non-governmental institutions concerned with
legal and human rights issues. The initiative has been institutionalized as <b>The
Palestinian Council Against Political Assassinations.</b> <br>
The meeting discussed the legal implications of Israel&#146;s political assassinations and
extra judicial killings, and examined the mechanisms whereby these violations could be
systematically documented and legally pursued before the relevant international courts and
tribunals dealing with war crimes and crimes against humanity. The participants also
discussed the existing Palestinian mechanisms concerned with the issue of war crimes and
Israeli violations of Palestinian rights, as well as ways of coordination with these
institutions. <br>
The council discussed the necessary steps to pursue a public campaign of information
focused at the legal and political aspects of the issue, and to prepare legal cases with
the required evidence. The council aims to coordinate its efforts locally, regionally, and
internationally. <br>
The council&#146;s initial effort will focus on mobilizing a group of Palestinian experts
in international legal issues, as well as various governmental and non-governmental
Palestinian institutions, to take concrete steps towards the fulfillment of this
objective. <br>
