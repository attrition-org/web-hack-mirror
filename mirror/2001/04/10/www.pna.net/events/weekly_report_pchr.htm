</strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;<br>
</font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">This report covers human rights violations perpetrated
by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories during the period of January 3-10, 2001.&nbsp; During this period, the Israeli
occupation forces continued to resort to the use of lethal force, shooting at Palestinian
civilians and firing artillery shells and heavy and medium bullets at Palestinian
houses.&nbsp; The Israeli occupation forces shot dead seven Palestinian civilians,
including a woman and a girl, with live ammunition.&nbsp; The most recent victim was a
70-year old Palestinian civilian who was shot dead by the Israeli occupation forces on
January 9, 2001, while he was on his way to his land, 100m away from the border to the
east of Deir El-Balah.&nbsp; Among the victims was also a 21-year-old nurse who was shot
dead by Israeli occupation forces on January 7, 2001, while she was traveling by a
civilian car near Nablus.&nbsp; She was shot in the chest.&nbsp; Additionally, Israeli
occupation forces fired heavy and medium bullets in Hebron on January 5, 2001.&nbsp; A
girl was killed with a heavy bullet in the chest, fired by the occupation forces while she
was on the roof of her family s house.&nbsp; Furthermore, a number of Palestinian
civilians were wounded with live ammunition fired by the Israeli occupation forces.&nbsp;
A number of Palestinian civilians were wounded when the Israeli occupation forces fired
artillery shells and heavy and medium bullets at Palestinian areas.&nbsp; According to the
investigations carried out by PCHR, this attack on Palestinian civilians by the Israeli
occupation forces was intentional, and it was carried out in the absence of any threat to
the lives of the occupation forces.<br>
</font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;Also during the same period, the Israeli
occupation forces continued to impose a total siege on the Occupied Palestinian
Territories.&nbsp; These forces also continued to impose an internal siege on the areas
under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, isolating these areas from one
another and from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.<br>
</font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;Finally, during this last week, the Israeli
occupation forces razed more areas of Palestinian agricultural land and demolished more
Palestinian houses and civilian facilities.&nbsp; This took place mainly in areas adjacent
to Dogit settlement established on the lands of Beit Lahia in the northern area of the
Gaza Strip. <br>

</b><font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;In the afternoon, at approximately 13:00
local time, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire from a tank positioned near the
junction leading to the Gush Qatif settlement block in Khan Yunis (Al-Matahen junction),
on an ambulance of the Palestinian Ministry of Health.&nbsp; The ambulance was on its way
on Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the north and south of the Gaza Strip),
transferring a sick child from Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis to Shifa hospital in Gaza
City. He was accompanied by a physician and a nurse.&nbsp; The ambulance was forced to
travel back to Nasser hospital.&nbsp; According to an official in the department of
medical aid at Nasser hospital, the transfer of the child was coordinated in advance with
the Israeli side.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Israeli occupation soldiers opened fire on the
ambulance that transported the sick child.&nbsp; Miraculously, the occupants of the
ambulance survived. <br>

children then demonstrated in the area.<b><br>
</font><br>
</b><font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;In the afternoon, at approximately 16:00
local time, some Palestinian taxis and private cars attempted to cross a muddy road from
the village of Salem in Nablus to a bypass road leading to Allon More settlement.&nbsp; A
passing patrol of the Israeli occupation forces opened fire on these cars from the bypass
road.&nbsp; Fatema Jalal Abu Jeish, 21 years old, from the village of Beit Dajan, to the
east of Nablus, was traveling inside the car of her sister s husband.&nbsp; She was hit
with two live bullets in the heart and the chest.&nbsp; She died before arriving at

</font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;Also in the afternoon, at approximately 16:00
local time, Israeli occupation soldiers shot Bassel Dhiab Abu Oweili, a 22 year old, from

Abu Houli road on the south of the Deir El-Balah, branch of Salah El-Din Street (the main
road between the north and south of the Gaza Strip).&nbsp; Abu Oweili was wounded with
shrapnel in the abdomen.&nbsp; He was evacuated to Shifa hospital in Gaza City.&nbsp; <br>
</font><br>

Israeli occupation forces shot dead Abdel-Hamid Ahmed Mosabbeh El-Khoratti, 34 years old,

chest, abdomen, pelvis, and the extremities.&nbsp; El-Khoratti was on his way from Gaza
City to his house in the Al-Moghraqa area.&nbsp; When he crossed the road, Israeli
occupation forces positioned on the roof of a nearby house opened fire on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Despite the fact that this transfer took place in accordance with instructions from the
Israeli occupation forces, they still detained the body on the road for more than seven
hours. The martyr s family could not reach the hospital due to the siege imposed on their
area of residence.&nbsp; Martyr El-Khoratti was a nurse at Shifa hospital in Gaza
City.&nbsp; He resigned nine years ago to resume his education. </font></p>

the same tract of land on January 3, 2001 and the remainder of land is threatened with
razing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;PCHR s field officer added that bulldozers of the Israeli occupation forces were
still in the area, leveling the areas of land that were razed, and that some Palestinian
farmers dismantled their greenhouses near the aforementioned areas fearing that these
greenhouses might be razed.&nbsp; PCHR s field officer also added that the Israeli
occupation forces notified Yasser Tafesh (Zendah) to evacuate his house which he shares
with his 12-member family, adjacent to the southwestern border of Dogit settlement.<br>

&nbsp;The Israeli occupation forces have continued to impose a total siege on the occupied
Palestinian territories.&nbsp; These forces have continued to close all international
crossings of the occupied Palestinian territories, the Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt
and the Al-Karama Border Crossing with Jordan, as well as Gaza International
Airport.&nbsp; These forces have also closed all border crossings through their
territories, prohibiting the movement of Palestinian citizens between the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; In the meantime, the Israeli occupation forces have continued to
isolate Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories.&nbsp; They have
also continued to close all commercial crossings into the Gaza Strip, allowing the entry
of only limited basic materials through the Al-Montar (Karni) Outlet.&nbsp; At the same
time, Israeli occupation forces, reinforced with military vehicles, have been deployed at
the entrances of Palestinian cities and on the main roads, imposing a strict siege on all
Palestinian cities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; They have isolated the areas
under the control of the Palestinian National Authority from one another and from the rest
of the occupied Palestinian territories.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation forces have continued to impose a strict
total siege, dividing the strip into three Bantustons separated from one another.&nbsp;

The Israeli occupation forces have also continued to impose a strict siege on the

control of the Israeli occupation forces.&nbsp; They have restricted the movement of its
Palestinian residents, including denying the access of students to their educational
institutions.&nbsp; (For more information about the siege and its disastrous impacts on
