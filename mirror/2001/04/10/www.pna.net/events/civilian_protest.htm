<br>
ISRAELI ARMY BRUTALLY ATTACKS PEACEFUL CIVILIAN PROTEST MARCH<br>
</strong></font><br>
March 24, 2001<br>
<br>
Today at 1:00 p.m., the Israeli army fired sound bombs, tear gas, and rubber coated steel
bullets at hundreds of peaceful protesters at the Al-Ram checkpoint. &nbsp;35 people have
been injured including two prominent leaders of the Palestinian Women?s movement and four
UPMRC first aid workers. One man suffered a heart attack from the tear gas.<br>
<br>
The march was held by Palestinian civil society organizations to protest the Israeli
imposed closures and occupation of Palestinian Territories. The march was attended by
thousands of representatives from Palestinian NGOs, doctors, nurses, lawyers, charitable
societies, women?s groups and peace activists. An Arab member of Knesset and Palestinian
solidarity groups from inside Israel met up with the protesters from the West Bank at
Al-Ram checkpoint.<br>
<br>
Once the march reached Al-Ram checkpoint, the Israeli army fired sound bombs and tear gas
canisters directly at people?s bodies and proceeded to fire ammunition. The Israeli
soldiers hit people with the butts of their guns and chased after people, attempting to
arrest them.<br>
<br>
Amal Khraisheh, the General Director of the Palestinian Working Women?s Society and Samar
Hawwash, a prominent leader of the women?s movement in Nablus were both injured.
&nbsp;Fahmi Shaheen, a human rights activist from Hebron suffered a heart attack from tear
gas inhalation. &nbsp;Rami Jamal Jalani, 19 years old was shot with a bullet in the
abdomen and is currently undergoing surgery at Ramallah Hospital. &nbsp;Most of those
injured were women, including Karima Sharaka, 37 years old and Reem Migdadi and Sunna
Qaud, both UPMRC first aid workers.<br>
<br>
Once again the Israeli army responds to peaceful civilian protests with viciousness and
brutal force.<br>
