<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the outbreak of the current AL-Aqsa Intifada on September 29, 2000,
the Israeli government (at its highest levels) and through directives given to its higher
army command has been implementing and carrying out a policy of assassinations and
extra-judicial murders (executions committed in cold blood). The first assassination in
the most recent conflict took place on November 9, 2000, when an Israeli helicopter fired
several rockets at Fatah&#146;s field commander vehicle in Bethlehem (Hussein Ibayat, 37)
, killing also two innocent elderly by-stander Palestinian housewives. Since that date,
deliberate and well-planned mafia-style assassinations have been taking place against
Palestinians almost on daily bases by members of the Israeli army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, over 19 cases of deliberate murders against known Palestinian
activists have been documented. In addition, and in the most recent days, we have been
witnessing a new &#147;lax open-fire policy&#148; issued by the Israeli army command that
allows Israeli soldiers to open fire with live ammunition, almost indiscriminately, for
the mere suspicion of feeling a threat (without defining what constitutes a threat). This
lax-open fire policy had resulted in the murder of several innocent Palestinians (most
noted, the case of Areej Al-Jabali, and others).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By relaxing its open-fire orders against Palestinian civilians, the
Israeli government is acting in violation of international law (specifically the Fourth
Geneva Conventions that require the occupying force of protecting civilians in time of
war). On the contrary, Israel is not only denying protection of Palestinian civilians as
required to do so by international laws. In fact, Israel is acting as an irresponsible and
Mafia state that adopts tactics of terror organizations which implement extra-judicial
executions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now that the Barak government had openly admitted its adoption of lethal
and systematic policy of willful murder; and now that it had been revealed that this
policy is no longer secret, and in fact, it has become State-sponsored terrorism, and an
operative arm of the Israeli policy; The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) believes
that it is its duty, and its right to pursue a world trial of members of the current
Israeli government (both as a group, and as individuals) on charges of committing
extra-judicial killings and war crimes at the international war-crimes tribunal. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli soldiers at the Halhoul junction arrested Khalid Khalil Ghanem,
27, from Hebron. After handcuffing him, the soldiers forced him to sit on the roadside.
Few minutes later, one of the soldiers opened fire at him from a close range. Ghanem was
hit with several bullets in his stomach. Soldiers left him unattended while he bled for
nearly 20 minutes; they also prevented a Palestinian ambulance that arrived at the scene
from reaching him. Later, an Israeli ambulance transported him to an Israeli hospital in
Jerusalem (Hadassah Ein Kerem). He suffered serious injuries and remains in critical
conditions. (<i>Sources, Wafa news agency, Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCR), and
Haaretz (according to Israeli army sources)&#150;Monday, January 7, 2001). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul-Hamid Ahmad Al-Kharti, 34, a male nurse who works at Shifa hospital
in Gaza was shot and killed almost immediately after he stepped out from an ambulance that
drove him home after a day&#146;s work at the hospital. Al-Kharti was still wearing his
medic&#146;s uniform when he was killed. Witnesses to the shooting (names available upon
request) said that Al-Kharti was hit with bullets fired by soldiers stationed inside
Israeli armored military vehicles posted at the railroad opposite from Al-Moghraqa mosque.

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At 10:30 am, a group of children were standing at the northern entrance of
Al-Biereh (at the site where the confrontations usually take place); A single Israeli army
vehicle was standing 200 meters away from the children near the City Inn hotel. According
to a testimony by the child Ibrahim who was present with the group of children (full name
available only upon request), the children were only watching and have not yet started
throwing stones at the soldiers. Suddenly, the Israeli army vehicle drove off from where
it was standing, and sped towards the children. The children started running away. As the
army vehicle approached the fleeing children, it swerved and soldiers inside, opened fire
toward the fleeing children. 10- year &#150; old Omar Farouk Khalid who attempted to run
away from the soldiers, only after the Israeli army&#146;s vehicle swerved and also after
soldiers have already opened fire was hit with a high velocity bullet in his right eye
(according to Dr. Hosni Al-Attari from Ramallah hospital). He remains in critical
condition in the intensive care unit at Ramallah hospital. Khalid&#146;s family said that
his brother was also injured in his eye by a rubber-coated metal bullet last week. (S<i>ources,

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatima Abu Jeish, 24, from the village of Bet Dajan who works as a clerk
at Nablus&#146;s Specialized Arab Hospital (SAH) was riding in the vehicle of her
brother-in-law with her sister. They were returning back to the village after a day&#146;s
work. At 4:25 PM, their car was stopped by Israeli soldiers at the entrance of the village
(from the direction of a bypass road used recently and frequently by the village residents
since the closing down by the Israeli army of the main entrance two and a half months
ago). Upon their arrival, Israeli soldiers who were standing outside their military
vehicles had already stopped three other Palestinian vehicles. Several other soldiers were
also standing at approximately 150 meters from the spot where their vehicle was stopped.
After waiting for around 40 minutes, soldiers in the patrols who were blocking the
entrance drove away, and cars started moving into the village. One of the Israeli soldiers
standing among the crowd of soldiers stationed at approximately 150 meters away suddenly
opened fire at the car. Fatima, who was sitting in the back seat, was hit in the heart
with a high velocity bullet and died immediately. Her brother in law immediately turned
around and transported her to Rafidya hospital in Nablus. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Doctors at the hospital said that a high velocity bullet hit Fatima in the
heart. Nine other shrapnel from the bullet also hit her lungs. (<i>Sources, Testimony by
Nasser Abu-Jeish (Fatima&#146;s brother in law who was driving the car, testimony by her

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Areej Al-Jabali, 18, from Hebron was chatting with her sister-in-law Ahlam
at the balcony of their home located at approximately 200 meters away from the settlement
of &#147;Bet Haggai&#148;. Nearby, in the neighborhood, young children were playinwith
firecrackers. Shortly after the sound of one of the firecrackers went off, several bullets
were fired from a guard post at the entrance of the settlement. A high velocity bullet hit
Areej in the chest and exited from her back only to hit also her sister-in-law Ahlam in
the chest. Both of them were rushed to the hospital, but all attempts by doctors to save
Areej&#146;s life failed. She was declared dead at the hospital. Her sister-in-law Ahlam
remains in serious condition. It is to be noted that Arij graduated from high school only
last year. <i>(Sources, testimony by Areej&#146;s brother-in-law, and Al-Ayyam daily,

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Members of a special unit in the Israeli army assassinated Dr. Thabet
Thabet, 50, a dentist, Palestinian peace activist, director-general of health inspection
at the PNA&#146;s health ministry, and Fatah&#146;s secretary-general in Tulkarem, shortly
after 10:00 AM. Dr. Thabet was assassinated moments after he entered his vehicle that was
parked at the entrance of his home in Tulkarem. Israeli Shin Bet (Israel&#146;s internal
intelligence branch) officials confirmed that the Israeli army and security forces were
responsible for Dr. Thabet&#146;s assassination (<i>Haaretz, January 8, 2001, Amos Harel,
military correspondent). </i>Dr. Thabet was among the most advocates of peace. He even
attended the funeral of an Israeli soldier in sympathy with his mother, Yehudit Harel, an
Israeli Peace Now activist. Mrs. Harel&#146;s son was killed in a car accident in 1994. <i>(Sources,

person who posed as someone whom he knew very well and trusted. He asked to meet with him
at the outskirts of the camp after fifteen minutes to discuss a serious manner.
Mala&#146;bi immediately left the house to meet his friend. 15 minutes later (at around
11:30 PM), a sound of an explosion was heard by residents of the camp at a close distance.
Camp residents who rushed to the scene of the explosion found Mala&#146;bi&#146;s body at
