<br>
The destruction and demolition of roads in the West Bank and Gaza by Israeli Forces<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
<br>
On the morning of March 7th, 2001 the Israelis, with the use of military<br>
bulldozers, demolished and totally destructed the main road connecting<br>
Ramallah with a number of Palestinian villages (33 villages, 200,000<br>
people)<br>
located at the north west of it including Birzeit university. The telephone<br>
lines, electricity, and water pipes were utterly obliterated.<br>
<br>
The road was constructed by the Palestinian Economic Council for<br>
Development<br>
and Reconstruction &#150;PECDAR- with the aid from South Korea, OPEC, and the<br>
World Bank. The total cost of its construction was 4 million dollars. It is<br>
worth noting also that the road serves more than 10 thousand students<br>
(schools and university) living in the Ramallah and the north west<br>
villages,<br>
and is the one and only connection leading to the main city (Ramallah) as<br>
well as hospitals and institutions.<br>
<br>
Therefore, we would like to bring to your notice, that PECDAR, as it<br>
condemns such inhumane actions caused by the Israeli authorities, calls for<br>
immediate alleviation of the closure imposed on that road as well as total<br>
rectification of the damages inflicted on its infrastructure.<br>
<br>
Similar acts of road destruction were also reported in the following cities<br>
and villages in the West Bank and Gaza:<br>
<br>
- Dura Al-Qare&#146; &#150; Ein Yabroud (Ramallah)<br>
- Al-Mazra&#146;a Al-Sharqiyyeh village entrance (Ramallah)<br>
- Singel village entrances (three) (Ramallah)<br>
- Turmus Ayya village entrance (Ramallah)<br>
- Al-Jalazone road (Ramallah)<br>
- Al-Jeeb &#150; Biddo road (Ramallah)<br>
- Um Safa entrance (Ramallah)<br>
- Beit Dajan &#150; Al-ghor road (Nablus)<br>
- Azoun east entrance (Qalqilia)<br>
- Wado Balat &#150; Ein Sinya entrance (Ramallah)<br>
- Nazlet Isa entrance (Tulkarem)<br>
- Bani Zeid Western entrance (Ramallah)<br>
- Halhul &#150; Bethlehem road (Hebron)<br>
- Al-Khader village entrance (Bethlehem)<br>
- Salah Eddeen Road (Gaza)<br>
- Khanyunis road (Khanyunis)<br>
- Rafah road (Rafah)<br>
In addition to that is the blocking of roads (91 roads in the West Bank and<br>
Gaza) using cement cubes, which totally prohibits entrance to blocked<br>
areas,<br>
and the digging of huge ducts around certain cities such as Jericho, which<br>
also prevents people from going in and out of the city.<br>
<br>
Any assistance that you might see appropriate will be greatly appreciated,<br>
especially at this particular time when the Israelies are obviously aiming<br>
at the complete destruction of the infrastructure of our cities and<br>
villages.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr. Mohammad Shtayyeh<br>
Managing Director<br>
