suspends its operations <br>
Saturday, March 10, 2001 <br>
</strong></font><br>
Birzeit University decided to suspend its operations Saturday, March 10, 2001, to protest
the siege that has been imposed on the University and its neighboring villages for the
past three days. The Israeli occupation forces dug up two trenches and bulldozed 100
meters of the road between Ramallah and Birzeit near Surda on the third day of Eid
Al-Adha. Thousands of people fell under yet another Israeli military siege. Telephone
lines were cut and the water pipes were severely damaged. After the Palestinians fixed the
telephone lines, water pipes and filled up the trenches, the Israeli occupation forces
retaliated by sending armored vehicles and tanks to make their siege even firmer. Birzeit
University condemns these inhumane measures and calls on the international community to
condemn these acts which defy all international laws. The University has written
explanatory letters to international organizations, including the United Nations and
UNESCO, appealing to them to intervene to remove the siege once and for all. As the
University suspends its operations for one day in protest against the Israeli measures,
&nbsp; it reaffirms its devoted commitment to guarantee the continuity of its academic
process without jeopardizing the freedom &#150; movement and otherwise, of its students or
staff. Birzeit University&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
