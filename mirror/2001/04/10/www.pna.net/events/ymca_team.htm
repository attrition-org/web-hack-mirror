12-16 November 2000 <br>
<br>
Report and findings<br>
</strong></font><b><br>
</b>We are an international team of YMCA people, coordinated and sponsored by the World
Alliance of YMCAs, who have been in Palestine for five days from the 12th to 16th November
2000. Our visit is part of our continuing involvement with the YMCA and peoples of
Palestine over many decades during which we have joined their search for a just and
comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian Question. The visit was prompted by serious
concern over what is clearly a deteriorating situation for the Palestinians in the wake of
recent aggressions by the Israeli Government, its army and settlers in the Occupied
Territories of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. It is, therefore, a
preliminary step, to be followed by more visits of solidarity with the Palestinian people,
towards making a YMCA contribution for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.<br>

<br>
</b>Our visit also coincides with the YWCA-YMCA World Week of Prayer and World Fellowship
whose theme for this year is &quot;My Peace I give to you&quot;. Many YWCAs and YMCAs
around the world will focus on their activities for the week around the issues of peace
and justice for the Palestinians. <br>
<b>The purposes of the visit were:<br>
</b>1. To express our solidarity with our sisters and brothers in Palestine who are
victims of a failed peace process and Israeli oppression.<br>
2. To develop a new global YMCA strategy in addressing the question of Palestine.<br>
During our stay we visited and met with a wide cross-section of society in the different
areas of Palestine including East Jerusalem, and the districts of Bethlehem, Ramallah,
Jericho, and Gaza. The people we met included Palestinian officials, Palestinian
Legislative Council members, YMCA staff and volunteers, partner organizations, religious
leaders - Muslims and Christians, medical personnel, and civil society leaders. We visited
a field hospital in Ramallah for victims of the innumerable clashes between the people and
the army and the settler community, which is run by the Red Crescent Society. We were also
in the homes of people who have lost loved ones, and met those whose homes were demolished
and/or burned down by Israeli shelling. <br>

<br>
Based on these visits and encounters with people, we arrived at several conclusions:<br>
</b>1. There are systematic and widespread human rights violations being perpetrated on
the entire Palestinian population. These take the form of demolishing houses, shooting at
ambulances and blocking their rapid passage to hospitals even when they are carrying
severely wounded or sick patients, detention of people without charges, killing people
without provocation, and placing entire villages and cities under a state of siege.<br>
2. There is use of massive force against unarmed protestors and completely innocent
people, mainly women, the elderly, and children.<br>
3. There is serious and widespread concern about the indifference and inaction on the part
of the international community in not implementing relevant United Nations resolutions
which guarantee the Palestinian people the right to statehood and identity. In this
connection, most people were surprised and angered by the voting pattern in the UN Human
Rights Commission concerning &quot;grave and massive violations of the human rights of the
Palestinian peoples by Israel&quot;. Many western countries - notably Germany, France,
Norway, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Canada, and the USA voted against this resolution.
This was a vote on a resolution condemning illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and
the occupied Palestinian territories. This was viewed as a situation in which Western
nations are adopting double standards in relation to Israel, whereas in other situations
of conflict the United Nations and Western nations have acted more decisively and with a
sense of urgency. The actions and inaction of Western governments - whose decisions can
make a fundamental difference to the situation - contradict their claims about pursuing
values of justice, freedom and democracy in all situations. In the case of the Palestinian
question, there seems to be selectivity, partiality, and a tendency to discard the will of
the international community which, in fact, must be the democratic base of resolving the
situation. <br>
4. There was biased and one-sided media reporting on the crisis, which left the
Palestinian side generally outraged. Palestinians refuse to accept the situation as one of
armed conflict. Armed conflict, they argue, involves two parties. This is a situation
where the Israeli Government and the settler community have created war-like conditions in
the Occupied Territories. The Palestinians have neither an army nor the level of weaponry
that the Israelis possess. But the media is biased not only in describing the conflict. It
is sympathetic to Israeli claims and positions and draws images of the Palestinian people
as irresponsible, and unwilling to dialogue, even accusing Palestinian mothers and fathers
of sending their children to die in battle. The facts are different. After decades of
occupation, and seven years of a failed peace process, the people feel a sense of urgency.
They cannot be asked to wait for too long. They fear that delay can lead to extremist
trends, which can only exacerbate the situation. <br>
5. The crisis has been further compounded by the increase in settlement activities. The
Oslo Accords were to put a freeze on the expansion of settlements. In fact it would
require a reversal of the policy of settlements. The blatant violation of this
understanding and the increasing militancy of the settlers is cause for grave concern and
urgent action. In summary, the situation is best described as one of repression and far
short of being anything close to normal.<br>

<br>
But these are only some of the problems that emanate from the crisis. There are other
issues too and the list is long, but it is necessary to point out some of the major
issues. These include the disruption of normal economic activity. Due to closures, workers
have been out of work for more than two months in the whole of Palestine. Agricultural
activity has come almost to a standstill due to army and settler activities. Medical
services have been severely hampered. The majority of children who live in the affected
areas suffer from trauma and psychological after-effects of the frequent shelling and army
activity. In many areas, educational services have also been disrupted by curfews, and the
virtual state of siege of towns and cities. The Vocational Training Services of many NGOs
have also been hampered. The work of the East Jerusalem YMCA in the areas of vocational
training, rehabilitation, and emergency services have also been dislocated. In this
connection we saw first hand the damages to buildings caused by shelling in the YMCA
premises in Beit Sahour. <br>
It was clear from all our encounters that the people of Palestine live in anguish,
uncertainty, and anger. Even though they are conscious of having to confront a much
stronger military force, they remain determined to carry on their struggle and fight until
the day when peace with justice can be achieved. For the Palestinian people, they will
stop at nothing short of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. They are
convinced that Israel will have to come to terms with the fact that Palestinian statehood
and national identity are absolutely non-negotiable issues. Furthermore, the Palestinians
consider that peace cannot be achieved by force or superior armament access. It must be
accompanied by dignity. <br>
We heard many heart-wrenching stories, and feel compelled to highlight a few of these,
simply because they were so shocking. Further, they serve to highlight the all-pervasive
tactics of intimidation and intent to bring the Palestinian people into submission. <br>
We were at a place of mourning in Beit Sahour where an entire community had gathered to
share their collective sense of loss over the death of two women who had been killed by
shelling from an army helicopter. One of them had visited the home of her sister to
express and share her sense of sadness and to console her at the demolishing of her
sister's home. She was accompanied by her neighbour. On their way home, they were hit by a
missile from a helicopter. It was clear from the injuries they sustained that their
chances for survival were minimal, but they were rushed to hospital and their relatives
informed. In a few hours they were both dead. <br>
We also heard about a vicious and savage attack by settlers on three elderly women, 75,
72, and 65 years of age, while they were picking olives in fields close to an Israeli
settlement in Nablus. It was three o'clock in the afternoon and they chose to do the task
themselves rather than send their children, assuming that it was safe for them to be at
the site of the olive farm. The settlers arrived in a group and the women were beaten with
iron rods until one was killed and the other two severely injured. It took some time
before Palestinians could come to their rescue and take the injured women to hospital. The
injured women lie in a state of shock, with acute injuries. <br>
<br>
For the community in particular and the entire Palestinian people, these incidents only
serve to underline and confirm the increasing brutality of the Israeli army and the
settlers. In Gaza, we once again visited the father of a 13 year old boy who had been
killed the previous day by gunfire from a settler community situated several miles away
from where the boy was shot. The father, and indeed the entire community, were astounded
by the killing of an innocent youth - just one of many other youth who are silenced by
death only because they chose to protest against their occupation and the violation of
their human dignity day in and day out. The father described how the son was born 13 years
ago shortly after his own imprisonment during the first Intifada. He described the present
Intifada as one which has been met by greater repression from the Israeli Government. This
time, it meant a death in his family. But, he pointed out, the Palestinians remain
steadfast to their goal for freedom and justice. Only then can there be any meaningful
peace, he pointed out. Indeed, the message everywhere seemed to be: &quot;Peace cannot be
found in the graveyards or under the barrel of a gun.&quot;<br>

</b>The international YMCA community has to take firm and coordinated action along with
churches and other concerned people as a matter of urgency. The one-sided nature of the
conflict demands that the YMCA take the side of the oppressed Palestinian people. Our
Christian obligations require that we work to seek justice so that genuine peace is
served. The violation of the rights of the people is an affront to their dignity and a
violation of the will of God who seeks justice and fullness of life for all. Palestinians
suffer gross injustices and aberration of human rights. We are reminded that we must work
for a world where &quot;righteousness and peace will kiss each other&quot;.<br>
Even in the midst of grave difficulties and suffering, and contrary to the media-created
stereotype of the Palestinians, it is a fact that they aspire for and seek peace built on
political dialogue. They want to break the cycle of violence so that future generations of
Arabs and Israelis can live together in harmonious co-existence and serve the cause of
development - human and economic - in a spirit of cooperation and mutuality.<br>
In the light of the above understanding, and in support of the aspirations of the
Palestinian peoples, we demand that the international YMCA community join forces with the
World YWCA and other concerned people and organizations to work towards realizing the
following stated aims:<br>
 Support for an independent international investigation/commission on the causes and
effects of the recent acts of violence unleashed by the Israeli army and the settlers, and
that NGOs, civil society groups, academics, intellectuals, social workers, and affected
people and communities be involved in this investigation.<br>
 Creation of an international protection force with immediate effect.<br>
 Concerted, urgent action by all member states of the United Nations to implement all UN
resolutions, particularly UN resolutions 242 and 338 that call for a withdrawal of Israel
from all occupied territories as pre-conditions to achieving a just and lasting settlement
to the Palestinian question. (Issues to be settled first must include dismantling of
settlements, acknowledging the right of return of all refugees, guaranteeing of borders -
including the return to borders as of 4 June 1967 - and the fair distribution of
resources.)<br>
 Launching of a new and revised peace process with a broader base of concerned parties
sponsoring and/or involved in the mediation.<br>
<br>
<b>Proposed Action Plan for the World Alliance of YMCAs on Palestine<br>
</b>1. To establish an office for an Observer as part of the World Alliance staff for a
period of 3-6 months with special responsibility to:<br>
 monitor human rights violations against the Palestinians - economic, social and
humanitarian; a particular focus on youth will form part of the mandate of the observer<br>
 monitor settlement and settlers' activities;<br>
 monitor Israeli media, official and press statements;<br>
 report on Palestinian humanitarian needs;<br>
 maintain daily contact with different human rights organizations working in Palestine;<br>
 work closely with the East Jerusalem and Gaza YMCAs on the above issues;<br>
 monitor the international press on its reporting on the situation in the territories
and issue statements clarifying facts on the ground;<br>
 work closely with the YMCAs in East Jerusalem and Gaza YMCAs using an appropriate
coordinating mechanism;<br>
 move physically to the different areas affected by the Israeli measures, and assess
needs as they emerge, and report to partner YMCAs and other organizations and the World
Alliance office.<br>
This appointment should be considered as urgent and the person to be selected may be
chosen on the following broad criteria:<br>
 Some experience and knowledge of the Middle East.<br>
 Commitment to human rights.<br>
 Have a YMCA background. <br>
 Preferably from a European country or the USA.<br>
 Somebody who could work under pressure and in conflict areas.<br>
 Have a proactive and progressive political understanding of events in the Middle East.<br>
2. The World Alliance of YMCAs to co-ordinate a global YMCA response to the humanitarian
needs in the area which are addressed by the YMCAs in Palestine. These needs should lead
to immediate action measures, and might be in the areas of:<br>
 detainees<br>
 injured, anguished and traumatized children and youth<br>
 forcefully displaced<br>
 families suffering from loss of income<br>
 families victimized through demolishing of their houses<br>
3. The YMCA movement should use all available means to advocate on the immediate critical
situation in Palestine and also on the long-term struggle for justice and peace for the
Palestinian people. In this effort various target groups should be addressed. This could
be achieved in the following ways:<br>
(a ) Influencing YMCA constituencies<br>
 &quot;Speaking Tours&quot; - representatives from Palestine visiting other countries to
present the current situation to YMCA communities, churches, NGOs, civil society groups,
and other concerned people whose opinions can make a difference to the situation.<br>
 Utilizing information technology (phone/fax, e-mail, web-sites) for sharing of
information, emergency appeals and for various other campaigns (e.g. signature campaigns)
etc.<br>
 Introducing a separate &quot;Solidarity and Prayer Day&quot; (possibly relating this to
the &quot;International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People&quot; organized by
the UN on 29th November).<br>
 Organizing a theological conference on the issue, in line with the recommendation from
the 14th World Council Meeting and in conjunction with meetings of SABEEL - an ecumenical
organization in East Jerusalem - in February 2001.<br>
(b) Key political persons and policy-makers<br>
 Urge local, national and regional YMCAs (especially in the USA and Europe) to network
with relevant lobby groups and networks. Co-ordination and support for this task should be
provided. <br>
 Provide information to parliamentarians and political parties on the emergency
situation and human rights/justice issues in Palestine with a view to obtaining their
support.<br>
(c) Identify key people and groups - including &quot;silent converts&quot; - in the civil
society to increase and enhance their involvement.<br>
 Develop systems for a media-watch on the Palestinian issue on the global level (by the
World Alliance of YMCAs in co-operation with the World YWCA and the World Student
Christian Federation), and at the national levels (through the information desks of the
YMCA movements).<br>
 Produce an information pack to be used to address the general public. This package
should be comprehensive but brief and attractive, and be used as an advocacy tool. It
could contain the following elements:<br>
- Brief history, and updating on the current situation.<br>
- Major UN resolutions.<br>
- The situation for Palestinian refugees.<br>
- The system of Israeli settlements.<br>
- Maps of the area indicting the geographical changes .<br>
- A list of additional information resources.<br>
- A documentary film/video on the situation<br>
4. The World Alliance to initiate a process with the YMCAs in Palestine to review its
organizational status and structure and examine its status in the world movement.<br>
<br>
<b>Into the future - a new vision must unfold<br>
</b>Our conviction is that peace is much more than an option to be explored. It is an
urgent imperative and necessity. And yet, such a peace cannot be hurriedly pursued: it
must be founded in a spirit of the search for equality, mutuality, and reconciliation, the
pre-condition of which is justice.<br>
We affirm the Palestinian vision of peace that is built on the foundations of dignity and
equality. Only then can there be the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the
people of Palestine and Israel.<br>
To this peace with justice, freedom and dignity for all we commit ourselves.<br>
'Peace is the perfect soil in which love can grow, and thus too, hope, forgiveness,
reconciliation, health, justice, equity and an end to war.'<br>
