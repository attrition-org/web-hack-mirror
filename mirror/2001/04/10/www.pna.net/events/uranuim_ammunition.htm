<p align="justify">Israel use of Depleted Uranium ammunition!!</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli repeated denials regarding use of Depleted Uranium (DU)
ammunition against Palestinian civilians, buildings and positions could no longer hold in
light of mounting evidence that proved, beyond doubt, Israeli military had actually used
such ammo especially during the current uprising (Al-Aqsa Intifada). Israeli disclaimers
failed to rebuff Palestinian growing concerns. President Arafat ordered the creation of a
special commission to follow-up the issue. The Commission was entrusted to lead legal and
publicity efforts to expose Israeli crimes. The Palestinian people insist Israel must bear
responsibility for the deadly effects of DU ammo on humans and the Palestinian
environment. In light of growing pressure, Israeli military authorities admitted to have
&#147;Stocked Depleted Uranium ammunition and actually used during the past twenty
years&#148; according to Israeli Daily Ha&#146;aretz of 11 January 2001.</p>

<p align="justify">This development represents further conclusive evidence in addition to
facts collected by international organizations that Israel had engaged in a systemic
campaign of genocide against the Palestinian people. Such development compels peace-loving
nations, including Arabs and others, to join the Palestinian people in its efforts, not
only to condemn Israeli atrocities but, help reveal the truth. These efforts would lead to
bringing Israeli officials to trail by an international tribunal. Furthermore, Arab and
international efforts should support the Palestinian proposal for convening a special
session by the UN Security Council to debate Israeli crimes. A resolution by the Un
Security Council to strip Israel of such weapons would be welcomed.</p>

<p align="justify">Arab and international efforts in this regard would not be a mere act
of solidarity with the Palestinians but would serve political, security and vital
interests of all parties concerned. Successful Arab participation would protect Arab
civilians in case of a regional war.</p>

<p align="justify">At the same time, we witness Europeans expand their efforts against
manufacturing, storage and use of DU ammunition in a mounting campaign to proscribe such
weapons after strong evidence revealed its deadly effects during NATO military operations
in Former Yugoslavia. An international position condemning Israel would enhance the
credibility of members of the international community, especially the Europeans, in their
efforts to pursue genuine peace in the region.</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli Usage of Depleted Uranium Confirmed</p>

<p align="justify">A report by an American organization, International Action Center,
confirmed the Israeli army used anti-tank rockets and shells containing Depleted Uranium
(DU). The depleted uranium enhances the shell&#146;s capability to penetrate heavy armor
or heavily fortified shelters. Yet, Israeli army used this type of shells against
Palestinian ordinary buildings, including houses, and in the assassination of dozens of
Palestinian activists. Israeli officials at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv confiscated
metal fragments and shell casings the IAC team had collected in order to test it for
Depleted Uranium and/or other radioactive components. The American report asserted:
&#147;Israeli usage of Depleted Uranium projectiles exposed many in Gaza and the West Bank
to radioactive pollution&#148;. Another report by a Dutch team, from LAKA Foundation,
affirmed Israeli use of Depleted Uranium shells in bombing Palestinian positions.</p>

<p align="justify">Palestinian Commission to Investigate Depleted Uranium Effects</p>

<p align="justify">The Palestinian Minister for the Environment, Youssef Abu-Safiah,
announced the formation of a Palestinian Commission to examine material evidence on
Israeli usage of Depleted Uranium ammunition against Palestinian civilians and positions.
Mr. Abu-Safiah added: &#147;The Commission, headed by Health Minister Dr. Reyad
Za&#146;anoun, would survey fragments of ammunition, sites and victims shot with this type
of weapons&#148;.</p>

<p align="justify">Related information became public publishing of a report by the
American organization International Action Center. The Palestinian Human Right Monitoring
Group wrote to Israeli Minister of Justice Youssi Beilin requesting investigation into the
Israeli military action. The Group affirmed: &#147;Israeli helicopter gun-ships of the
Apache and Cobra types are similarly equipped to fire such projectiles as those used by
the Americans in Iraq and Kosovo.</p>

<p align="justify">IAEA Confirms Israel Nuclear Tests</p>

<p align="justify">In its report for 2001, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
confirmed that Israel had conducted nuclear tests near the Egyptian borders and in the
waters of the Gulf of Aqaba. An Egyptian team headed by Dr. Tareq Nimer conducted
extensive research on soil and water samples taken from the area. Information about
&#147;Radioactive Pollution&#148; was leaked about two years ago. A team from the IAEA
conducted similar research and reached the same conclusions.</p>

<p align="justify">Israel Refuses to Ratify Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli Daily Ha&#146;aretz reported on 29 November 2000, that Israel
had refused to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. Ha&#146;aretz affirmed: &#147;The
Israeli military establishment strongly pressured Israeli economic and political circles
that favor ratification of the Convention not to do so&#148;. The CWC provides for
&#147;Prohibition of development, manufacturing, storage, possession and use of chemical
weapons&#148;. The Convention requests State Parties to open its manufacturing facilities
to international inspection and to declare its stockpiles. Israel, allegedly claim Arab
threats are behind its refusal to ratify the CWC and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

<p align="justify">Israel&#146;s Newest Submarines Threaten Regional Stability</p>

<p align="justify">In an article translated by Al-Hayat of London, British politician
Ceril Townsend pointed to the three Dolphin-type German submarines were not strictly a
commercial deal but an outcome of a long military cooperation between Israel and Germany.
The submarines were part of German compensation to Israel for crimes committed by the
Nazis against Jews. Townsend expressed the submarines add a new dimension to Israel&#146;s
nuclear superiority, with its 200-300 warheads, over other states in the region. The
British politician concluded that Israel&#146;s newest submarines represent a grave
escalation of the arms race that is condoned by USA. He asserted the submarines, capable
of hiding in one of Turkey&#146;s harbors, are able to deliver a first or even a second
strike to any Arab country from a safe distance.</p>

<p align="justify">Israel Ranks Number One Importer of Weapons in the Middle</p>

<p align="justify">The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies affirmed
the Middle East is the largest arms market with expenditures topping 60 billion US
dollars. The Institute asserted the recent increases in oil revenues allowed for more
purchasing of more weapons. A recent report by the Institute indicated that Israel is the
number one importer of arms in the region. Israeli defense budget, increased by 4% this
year, exceeded 9 billion US dollars compared to that of Saudi Arabia with arms purchases
exceeding 6 billion US dollars. According to the Institute, the United States remained the
number one seller of arms to the region. American sales to the region increased to 49.1%
of total sales compared to 47.6% last year.</p>

<p align="justify">France and Germany Stop Certain Arms Sales to Israel</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli Daily Ha&#146;aretz reported on 27 December 2000 that France
and Germany, in an undeclared embargo, had stopped the sale of certain types of military
equipment to Israel since the beginning of the Palestinian Intifada on 28 September 2000.
The Israeli Daily referred to the Director-General of TAR, an Israeli importer of military
equipment, who claimed a German manufacturer refused to sell Israel a new smoke-producing
grenade because of the difficulty to obtain necessary government permits. The French
company Nobel Secrete stopped the sale of 100,000 tear gas canisters to Israel when the
French Foreign Ministry and its Specialized Committee stalled the sale.</p>

<p align="justify">Arab Ministers Call for Closure of Dimona Nuclear Reactor</p>

<p align="justify">During a meeting held in Cairo last December, Arab Environment
Ministers called upon the international community to pressure Israel in order to close its
nuclear reactor in Dimona. The Arab call came after reports of potential environmental
crisis and grave dangers posed by the old reactor to Palestinian land including water
aquifers. The Ministers expressed deep concern over Israeli nuclear activities that are
being carried in total defiance of international inspection requirements. Because of its
old age, the reactor poses a grave danger of a catastrophic magnitude as its outdated
technology disregards internationally set safety measures.</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli Toxic Waste in Gaza and the West Bank</p>

<p align="justify">The Palestinian Environment Minister Youssef Abu-Safiah confirmed
substantiated reports, supported by satellite photos, prove Israel had buried toxic waste
in the Palestinian Territories south of Hebron and southeast of Gaza Strip. The Minister
affirmed the Palestinian National Authority could not reach these sites because of the
Israeli siege.</p>

<p align="justify">Golan Heights Alternative Site for Waste Disposal Instead of Jordan</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli authorities stored a large shipment of Toxic waste near Arab
villages in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Last year, Israel tried to export the same
shipment to Jordan claiming it was raw materials to manufacture paint. Jordanian officials
refused to allow the shipment into Jordan. Popular organizations in the Golan Heights
called upon the United Nations to intervene and pressure Israel to remove the waste from
the occupied Heights. Syrian NGOs in the Golan Heights affirmed the action is proof of
Israeli disregard to civilian safety in the Israeli-occupied territories.</p>

<p align="justify">Israeli Nuclear Arsenal a Threat to Security</p>

<p align="justify">The Jerusalem Press Agency quoted Dr. Hazem Nussaibeh, former Minister
of External Affairs and Jordan&#146;s Ambassador to the United Nations accusing Israel of
&#147;Exerting efforts to be the only nuclear power in the Middle East to confront Arab,
African and Moslem states&#148;. Dr. Nussaibeh considered this policy to be a threat to
Arab national security whether the peace process succeeds or fails. Furthermore, the
Jordanian diplomat affirmed the current Israeli atrocities against the Palestinians would
pressure Arab regimes to re-consider Arab boycott of Israel. He added the current
aggression would cast great shadows that might hinder regional cooperation in the future.</p>

<p align="justify">Israel Impedes Arab Development</p>

<p align="justify">A reputed Arab financier Mr. Joseph Tarabay affirmed the continued
Israeli aggression against the Arabs and its current escalation against the Palestinians
to the verge of war represents a major obstacle towards Arab development and economic
growth. Mr. Tarabay, the Vice-President of the Federation of Arab Banks, asserted the
economic, political and social conditions in the region require building modern Arab
systems that could overcome obstacles posed by Israel or others. He affirmed the
importance for the Arab person to acquire modern skills to help him/her increase
productivity to adapt to rapid economical developments..</p>
