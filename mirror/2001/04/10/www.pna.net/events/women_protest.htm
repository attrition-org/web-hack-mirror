</strong></font></p>

<p align="justify">Palestinian women are planning a peaceful protest march to the Israeli
military blockade on the main road between Ramallah and Jerusalem at 10:00 am on Monday
March 19, 2001. </p>

<p align="justify">The demonstration is organized by the General Union of Palestinian
Women in coalition with various Palestinian women&#146;s organizations. The organizers
said that the protest's main theme would be &quot;Women Against the Siege and the
Occupation.&quot; <br>
<br>
According to the organizing committee, protesters will also march carrying placards that
read: &quot;Save our children - We want international protection&quot;, &quot;We love our
children as much as you do&quot;, &#147;Siege = Apartheid&#148; and &quot; No more
exceptions to international law: end the occupation now!&#148;</p>

<p align="justify">The march will begin at 10 am at the Juabeh Hospital at the entrance of
Qalandia Refugee Camp (coming from Ramallah). </p>
