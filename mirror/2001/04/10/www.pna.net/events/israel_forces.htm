Palestinian Civilians<br>
&nbsp;January 8 2001</font></strong></p>

Abdul Hameed el Kharti (38), from el Mighraka in the Gaza Strip was killed by the Israeli
security forces on Sunday evening. Kharti was mentally handicapped. According to
Palestinian sources, Kharti¹s body was riddled with bullets on the road leading to the
Netzarim settlement.<br>
<br>
In the West Bank, twenty one year old Fatma Abu Jeesh from Beit Dajan village in the
Nablus district, was also killed on Sunday by Israeli fire near the village of Salem.
&nbsp;According to an eyewitness Abu Jeesh was mortally wounded when Israeli soldiers
opened fire on vehicles traveling in the vicinity of Salem.<br>
<br>
In a separate incident, Mahmoud Abu Haseera (37) from the Gaza Strip was killed on Friday
5 January. According to Israeli sources Haseera was shot while trying to enter Israel
illegally. Haseera¹s family have denied Israel¹ s claims. Haseera was handicapped.<br>
<br>
Also on the 5 January, as a result of Israeli shelling on residential areas in Hebron,
Areej el Jabali (18) was killed. Ahlam Jabali, Areej¹s cousin, was injured in the same
incident.<br>
<br>
Despite repeated declarations from the United Nations and international human rights
organizations, Israel continues to use lethal force against unarmed civilians. LAW has
stressed repeatedly over the period of the current intifada that such acts constitute
crimes of war. The killing of a resident of occupied territory in circumstances that are
not life threatening to the army of occupation is willful killing, and is thus a grave
breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention (art 146,147). Moreover,<br>
article 32 of the convention stipulates:<br>
<br>
³The High Contracting Parties specifically agree that each of them is prohibited from
taking any measure of such a character as to cause the physical suffering or extermination
of protected persons in their hands. The prohibition applies not only to murder,
torture&#138;but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or
military agents.² </p>

<p>In light of the enormous loss of life over the past few months, with most of those
killed being unarmed Palestinian civilians, LAW calls on the High contracting parties to
the Fourth Geneva Convention to abide by their article 1 obligation and ensure Israel¹s
adherence to the Conventions provisions pertinent to territories under belligerent
occupation.<br>
