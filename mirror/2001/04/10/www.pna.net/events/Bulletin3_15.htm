<p align="left"><strong>1) 17-year old shot in the head and killed by Israeli soldiers</strong></p>

<p align="left">Murtaja Abdel Latif, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy, was shot in the head
by an Israeli Army sniper yesterday during confrontations with Israeli soldiers on the
outskirts of Qalqilia in the north of the West Bank. His body was found this morning.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>2) Brothers of murder victim denied right to return to work</strong></p>

<p align="left">The four brothers of Mohammed Soof, a Palestinian man killed by Israelis
about six weeks ago in the village of Hares near Salfit, have been denied a renewal of
their work permits for their jobs at a nearby Jewish settlement. The four have been
working at the industrial zone of the settlement of Barqan for many years, one of them has
been the shift supervisor for ten years. After the death of their brother a month and a
half ago, the Israeli security forces (Shabak), refused to renew their permits. </p>

<p align="left">27-year-old Mohammed Soof was shot on January 8th as he was walking from
his house to that of his brother in the early evening. He was not involved in any
demonstration or confrontation at the time of his death &#150; he was organizing his
little daughter&#146;s birthday party. </p>

<p align="left">That evening, village youth were throwing stones at settlers&#146; cars
driving past the village and Israeli soldiers were shooting at them. Mohammed decided to
make sure his teenage brother came to the party, and went out to get him. &quot;Don't lock
the door&quot;, he told his wife. &quot;I'll be right back.&quot; </p>

<p align="left">On the way to his brother&#146;s house, Mohammed was shot in the chest.
Israeli soldiers did not allow anyone near to assist him. He bled to death. After a
military medic confirmed that he was dead, his family was allowed to take his dead body
away.</p>

paralyzed. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>3) Israeli settlers unleash their dogs on Palestinian school girls</strong></p>

<p align="left">Students of the Girls&#146; High School in the village of Al Liban Al
Sharki north of Ramallah were chased by a big dog which Jewish settlers released on them
while they were on their way home yesterday. One of the girls broke her arm when she fell
while running in fear for her life. This is not the first time that settlers have used
this method of terrorizing the villagers of Al Liban.<br>

<strong>4) Palestinian girl hit by an Israeli settler in his car </strong></p>

<p align="justify">Fatme Suleiman, a seven-year old Palestinian girl, was run over by a
Jewish settler&#146;s car in the village of Jabba, southeast of Jerusalem. The settler
drove away after hitting the little girl, who suffered fractures in many parts of her
body. </p>
