<p>Palestine Red Crescent Society Emergency Medical <br>
Station in Jenin (North West Bank) responded to rescue an injured Israeli civilian who had
apparently been shot and wounded earlier on the outskirts of the town. The PRCS paramedics
worked to stabilize the victim&#146;s condition.&nbsp;The 25 year old male was shot 4
times and was bleeding heavily. He was transported to Jenin Public Hospital. After
additional medical care, he was later transported by the PRCS ambulance crew to an
awaiting Israeli military ambulance.</p>
