<p align="center">Israeli Forces Violate Palestinian Pilgrims&#146; right to Worship:<br>
Al-Haq Demands Immediate International Intervention to Guarantee Pilgrims&#146; Access to
Mecca <br>
<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<p>Today, 14 February 2001, at approximately 11 AM, Israeli Occupying Forces opened fire
near the Rafah border crossing at Palestinian pilgrims who were on their way to
Mecca.&nbsp; The 500 pilgrims were refused exit from the Gaza International Airport and
then detained until the airport was closed.&nbsp; Due to time constraints, rather
scheduling a new flight from Gaza the trips organizers attempted to transport the pilgrims
through the Rafah border crossing that connects the Palestinian territories with Egypt.
According to eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire at the pilgrims soon after they
reached the area of the crossing. The pilgrims were thus unable to complete their trip and
had to return to their homes. <br>
<br>
These Israeli actions violate the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.&nbsp; Of specific relevance are the articles
related to freedom of worship including Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human
rights which states,<br>
<br>
&#147;Everyone has the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right
includes&#133; freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private,
to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and
observance.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Al-Haq would like to express concern over this incident and demands that:<br>
<br>
- The Israeli military hold an immediate investigation into the incident 

<dl>
  <dd>- The international community intervene to guarantee immediate and
    safe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transportation of Palestinian pilgrims to Mecca </dd>
  <dd>- The UN Human Rights Commission currently present in the Occupied Territories
    immediately call for international protection for Palestinian civilians </dd>
  <dd>- The UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance act immediately to guarantee
    Palestinian pilgrims&#146; access to Mecca. <b></dd>
</dl>
