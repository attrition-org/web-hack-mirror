Israeli Occupation Forces escalate their aggression and divide the Gaza Strip into four
parts<br>
</strong></font><font size="3" color="#000000"></p>

<p>1. On Friday 23/2/2001 in a dangerous escalation the Israeli Occupation Forces
completely separated again the north of the Gaza Strip from the south thus preventing
completely the movement of individuals, goods and vehicles across Salah ad-Din Road. This
was carried out by closing Al-Shuhada Crossing with cement blocks and the bulldozing of
the coastal road and its closure with sand piles. The prevention of movement included
ambulances. Thus the Occupation Forces prevented the movement of an ambulance belonging to
Abu Yusuf Al Najjar Hospital in Rafah at Al-Shuhada Crossing which was heading for Shifa
Hospital in Gaza and which was transporting Talal Hasan Abu Arida 18 years-old, who was
injured in the head with a machine-gun bullet in Rafah. The ambulance was only allowed
through after three hours even though the medical team indicated to the occupation soldier
the gravity of the case. It is worth mentioning that the occupation forces continue since
25/11/2001 to close Salah ad-Din Road which is the main road that connects the north of
Gaza with the south. This closure leads to the division of Gaza into four isolated parts: 

<dl>
  <dd>The area between ash-Shuhada Crossing to the south and Bait Hanun to the north. </dd>
  <dd>The area between ash-Shuhada Crossing to the north and Kufar Darum to the south. </dd>
  <dd>The area between Kufar Darum to the north and Rafah to the South. </dd>
  <dd>The Mawasi area between Khan Yunis and Rafah which is totally closed to he outside world
    and the entrance to or exit from is forbidden. </dd>
</dl>

<p>2. In addition to this, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have shelled with
tank artillery from the Ily Sinai Settlement in the northern most point in Gaza two
National Security positions, numbers 2 and 3, situated to the north of the Bedouin Village
in Bait Lahia near the truce line. Following the shelling military bulldozers have
proceeded to bulldoze the two above-mentioned military points and level them completely.<br>
3. The continued policy of aggression by the forces of occupation prevented a number of
PLC and PNC members from attending the Conference of Arab Parliaments in the United Arab
Emirates. <br>
What the Israeli belligerent forces of occupation have carried out constitutes a
systematic violation of the rules of international law and especially the provisions of
the 4</font><sup><font size="1">th</font></sup><font size="3"> Geneva Convention according
to which a collective punishment, a continuation of war crimes and crimes against humanity
are being perpetrated. In the light of the dangerous situation which the Israeli Forces
have brought about and their continuing escalation and their targeting of Palestinian
civilians and their property the immediate intervention of the international community is
demanded in order to put an end to the continuing massacre and in accordance with the
legal and moral duties in relation to the Palestinian civilians and what is demanded by
international law. Al Mezan Center warned of the danger of the silence of the
international community towards the crimes perpetrated by the occupation forces against
the Palestinian citizens and their property. This silence has led to and continues to lead
to the proliferation of the violations of the Palestiniansâ&#128;&#153; human rights. Al
Mezan emphasizes at the same time the importance of international protection for the
civilians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and bringing the Israeli war
criminals before an international court.<br>
