Uprising<br>
December 30, 2000 -January 6, 2001 <br>
</strong></font></p>

<p><br>
Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been
steadily increasing in the past few weeks. These settlers have generally acted with
impunity, as the Israeli military and court system historically have been reluctant to
arrest, try, and punish settlers for violence they commit against Palestinian civilians.
As a result, settlers are virtually free to carry out intimidation, assaults against
people and property, and even murder against the Palestinian population. <br>
<br>
The existence of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories violates both
international law and particular international <br>
agreements Israel is signed on. According to Article 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention it
is prohibited to transfer civilians of an occupying power to the territory occupied.<br>
<br>
Since the Oslo accord in 1993, the number of settlers in the West Bank and Gaza has
doubled to 200,000, not including approximately 200,000 settlers now living in East
Jerusalem. The building during Barak's government has actually escalated, with 14,000
settlers added and tenders issued for building 4,000 units last year alone, compared with
3,000 units a year built under Netanyahu. Compared to 1999, in the year 2000 there has
been a 96% increase in settlement building. <br>
<br>
Israel has continually expropriated large amounts of land from Palestinians for the
settlement of Jewish civilians, in order to <br>
change the demography of the area and create irreversible facts on the ground.<br>
<br>
The AIC has been monitoring settler violence, and now introduces a regular updated report.<br>
