LET OUR PEOPLE LIVE!<br>
March 10th, 2001 </strong></font></p>

<p><br>
We, faculty and staff at Birzeit University, appeal to our colleagues and friends around
the world to help us in delivering our simple but urgent message -- let our people live!
We will be delivering this message in peaceful marches of protest to the Israeli soldiers
and tanks that currently prevent us from reaching our University by the only road that
allows accessibility and that has been recently blocked. The suffering of Palestinians in
surrounding villages who are cut off from their livelihoods, health care, schools and
markets is also acute. So far protests have only been met with bullets and tear gas. We
need your help to bring our message to the world.<br>
The wave of violence against the Palestinian population has reached unprecedented
proportions. The Israeli army's policy of siege through blocking roads and digging
trenches around towns and villages has been escalating, making it practically impossible
to meet people's very basic needs.</p>

<p>This policy has now reached Birzeit University, preventing us and our students from
reaching campus to continue our classes, labs and academic life.<br>
On 7 March 2001 in the dead of night, the Israeli army destroyed portions of the only road
linking the University to Ramallah, gouging out trenches and destroying about 400 meters
of asphalt. <br>
This damage to the only road linking Ramallah City to Birzeit village and 33 other
villages with a population of about 65000 has resulted in the total disruption of daily
life. To date, cars, ambulances and provisions are not able to cross to and from Birzeit
and surrounding villages. Most Palestinian populated areas have already been hermetically
sealed, disregarding all standards of dealing with civilians and contravening
international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention. </p>

<p>These measures are, in the full sense of the term, war crimes.<br>
With these actions, it becomes clear that such policies are part of a long term strategy
that Israel is pursuing in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This strategy has been
adopted by successive Israeli Governments, both of Barak and Sharon, in order to subjugate
the entire population, and will them to accept the unacceptable.<br>
We call on you to ACT NOW:<br>
1. Call for an immediate end to the closure policies.<br>
2. Call for the international protection of the Palestinian population.<br>
3. Demand that Israel abide by international law.<br>
Call the nearest Israeli Embassy in your area, or send your protests to the Israeli
Government on these email addresses.</p>
