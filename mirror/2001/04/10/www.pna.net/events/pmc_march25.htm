Sharon Preparing Israeli Public for rejection of&nbsp; Sharm&nbsp; El-Sheik Fact-Finding
Committee report<br>
</strong></font><br>
25 Mar 2001 <br>
<br>
Palestinian officials warned on Sunday that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is setting
the stage for rejecting the recommendations of the Sharm El-Sheik Fact Finding Committee
even before the Committee has begun drafting its report. <br>
Minister of Information and Culture, Yasser Abed Rabbo, stated that &#147;Sharon is fully
aware that an independent and neutral committee will hold Israel largely accountable for
the current crisis and as a result, he is already setting the stage to reject the
Committee&#146;s report as unfair and biased.&#148; <br>
Abed Rabbo&#146;s comment came after reports that Sharon called Israel&#146;s agreement to
the formation of the Committee a &#147;historic mistake&#148;, and vowed that Israel will
not agree to be &#147;put on trial.&#148; Abed Rabbo called Sharon&#146;s comments a form
of &#147;pre-emptive blackmail,&#148; adding that &#147;Israel&#146;s superficial
cooperation with the Committee, while clearly indicating its intention to ignore the
Committee&#146;s conclusions, is further evidence of Sharon&#146;s belief that Israel is
above the law.&#148;<br>
Israel has repeatedly attempted to impede the Committee&#146;s work. It suspended
cooperation with the Committee in mid-January and twice delayed the Committee&#146;s
arrival. Last Thursday, Israel refused to allow Palestinian coordinators and members of
the press to accompany the Committee in an official convoy from Ramallah to Hebron.<br>
The Committee completed its meetings in occupied Palestinian territory yesterday by
touring Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and meeting with Palestinian businessmen and
mayors in Bethlehem. <br>
Palestinians have urged the Committee to investigate the &#147;root causes&#148; of the
Intifada, such as Israel&#146;s policy of on-going settlement construction and land
confiscation, both of which violate the Oslo Agreement&#146;s prohibition on unilateral
actions which would prejudice a final peace agreement. <br>
