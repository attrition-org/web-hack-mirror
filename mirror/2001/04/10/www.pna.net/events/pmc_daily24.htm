<p align="left">1) Palestinian man beaten to death by Israeli settlers</p>
</b>

<p align="left">The body of Jabri Ahmad Hamdan, a 44 year-old Palestinian man, from Dora
Al-Khalil, was found killed on the night of March 23<sup>rd</sup>, near the Jewish
settlement of Halmeesh north of Ramallah. He was beaten to death by Israeli settlers.
Eyewitnesses have stated having seen bloodstained rocks in the area. After examining his
body, medical officials stated that Hamdan was probably killed one week ago. </p>

<p align="left">2) Red Cross being hindered by Israeli authorities</p>
</b>

<p>Walter Stocker, head of a delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
complained that Israeli authorities have been hindering their work in the last few weeks,
by subjecting the organization&#146;s trucks coming from Jordan to new regulations. The
goods now have to be unloaded at the border and then reloaded onto other trucks (with
Israeli license plates), which raises the cost of the aid efforts significantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker also criticized the Israeli siege imposed on Palestinian cities and
villages, which causes long delays in getting sick and wounded people to hospitals.</p>

</b>

<p>Hundreds of Palestinians participated in a peaceful march against the Israeli siege
today. The march was organized by a coalition of Palestinian civil society institutions
and went from the north of Ar-Ram to the checkpoint seperating Ar-Ram from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>At the Israeli military checkpoint, the protestors were met with tear gas and sound
bombs fired by Israeli soldiers. Protestors did not throw stones. More than thirty
potestors were injured.</p>
