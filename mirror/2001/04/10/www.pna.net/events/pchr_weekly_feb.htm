Introduction<br>
<br>
This report covers Israeli human rights violations against Palestinian civilians in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories during the period of February 8-14, 2001. &nbsp;During
the second week of February 2001, there has been a significant escalation of Israeli human
rights violations against Palestinian civilians and their properties in the Occupied
Palestinian<br>
Territories.<br>
<br>
In Khan Yunis, the Israeli occupation forces used a new and more virulent tear gas against
Palestinian civilians. &nbsp;According to field reports and medical sources at Nasser
hospital in Khan Yunis, dozens of Palestinian civilians, including children under 15,
suffered from tear gas inhalation with unusually severe symptoms. &nbsp;These unique
symptoms included convulsions throughout the body, difficulties in breathing and pains in
the abdomen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dozens of Palestinian civilians remain in hospitals
in Khan Yunis because Palestinian physicians are not able to determine the proper course
treatment in these cases. &nbsp;The Palestinian community lacks the technical means to
identify it. &nbsp;PCHR expresses its profound concern regarding the use of this gas. <br>
<br>
The Israeli occupation forces shot and killed six Palestinian citizens, including two
children, in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. &nbsp;On Friday, February 9, 2001, the
child Ahmed Abdel-Raziq Abu Houli, 15, from Deir El-Balah, died from a live bullet in the
abdomen shot from a distance of approximately 700m. &nbsp;When he was shot, Abu Houli was
on his way to his uncle's house to the southeast of Kfar Darom settlement. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Monday morning, February 12, 2001, Israeli soldiers opened fire on a bus of Palestinian
laborers traveling from Bethlehem to their places of work in Israel. &nbsp;Ziad Ali Abu
Sawi, 22, from Artas village near Bethlehem, was killed with a live bullet in the chest.
&nbsp;Two hours later, to the southwest of Ramallah, Israeli occupation soldiers opened
fire on a Palestinian civilian car killing its driver A'ttef Ahmed El-Nabulsi, 35, from
Ramallah. &nbsp;He died from live bullet wounds in the neck and the chest, fired from a
distance of only three meters. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tuesday morning, February 13, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces committed another
political assassination and extra-judicial killing. &nbsp;&nbsp; Maso'ud Hussein A'yyad,
57, was killed while he was traveling the main road near Jabalya by a direct hit to his
car of three rockets fired from a combat helicopters. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Less than an hour later, Israeli occupation soldiers shot and killed the child Bilal
Tawfiq A'wwad Ramadan, 14, from Al-Boreij refugee camp, with a live bullet in the chest.
&nbsp;He was demonstrating with a number of other Palestinian school children to the south
of Netzarim settlement, located south of Gaza City. &nbsp;On Wednesday morning, February
14, 2001, Israeli occupation soldiers near a military roadblock at the entrance of Ramin
village in Tulkarm opened fire on a Palestinian civilian car. <br>
Consequently, A'ayed Khaled Abu Harb, 24, from Nour Shams refugee camp was shot and killed
by two dumdum bullets in his back which then settled in his abdomen. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In addition to Palestinian civilians killed during this period, dozens of Palestinian
civilians, including a number of children, were wounded by gunfire of Israeli forces'
shooting. &nbsp;This occurred both during clashes and when there were no clashes in the
area.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Israeli forces continued to raze Palestinian agricultural land and demolished
Palestinian houses and civilian facilities in the Gaza Strip. <br>
<br>
During the same period, the Israeli occupation forces continued to fire artillery shells,
heavy bullets, and medium caliber bullets at Palestinian residential neighborhoods in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. &nbsp;Consequently, many Palestinian civilians were wounded
and dozens of houses and civilian facilities were damaged.<br>
<br>
In addition, PCHR documented a number of incidents during which the Israeli occupation
forces opened fire upon on-duty medical personnel and ambulances. &nbsp;According to an
investigation carried out by PCHR, Jehad Abdel-Karim Abu Attaya, a 44-year-old medic, was
seriously wounded by a live bullet in the chest. On February 13, 2001, Israeli forces
fired upon Abu Attaya while he was inside an ambulance in Khan Yunis. &nbsp;Not even local
and international journalists are immune to being fired upon by Israeli forces.
&nbsp;Several journalists have been injured while covering clashes between Israeli forces
and Palestinian civilians.<br>
<br>
During the past week, the Israeli occupation forces continued to impose a total siege on
the occupied Palestinian territories. &nbsp;They closed all border crossings and Gaza
International Airport, despite the fact that it is currently the season of pilgrimage to
Saudi Arabia. &nbsp;Thousands of Palestinian pilgrims who had originally planned to depart
from Gaza International Airport were forced to travel by bus to Al-A'rish Airport in the
Sinai from where they flew to Saudi Arabia. &nbsp;In addition, PCHR's field officers
reported that the Israeli forces prohibited the travel of dozens of Palestinian pilgrims
to Egypt, in a violation of their human right to worship freely. &nbsp;The Israeli
occupation forces also continued to prevent the entry of Palestinian citizens into
Jerusalem, thus preventing them from praying at Islamic and Christian holy sites.
&nbsp;(For more information about the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip and its disastrous
consequences, see Closure Update, a report by PCHR on the closure imposed by the Israeli
occupation forces on the Gaza Strip.) <br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Shortly after Friday Prayer, Israeli soldiers opened fire on a number demonstrating
Palestinian civilians, including many children. &nbsp;These civilians were fired upon
while demonstrating at a distance of more than 150m the soldiers' position located near
Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza City. &nbsp;As result, nine Palestinian
civilians, including eight children under 18, were wounded with live bullets. &nbsp;They

Nazhem Maso'ud, 21, was wounded with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the head. &nbsp;He
was evacuated to Rafidya hospital in Nablus where he arrived in critical condition.<br>
<br>
After the Friday Prayer, Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators, shooting
indiscriminately. &nbsp;Consequently, Laurent Van Der Souke, a 36-year-old French reporter
from Gama Press Agency was wounded in the knee with a live bullet while he was covering
the clashes. &nbsp;In addition to the reporter, three Palestinian civilians were wounded
with live bullets. &nbsp;They were:<br>
<br>
1) Hazem Ibrahim Abu Qare', 18, from the village of Al-Mazra'a Al-Gharbia, wounded with a
live bullet in the right shoulder which penetrated his back;<br>
2) Ibrahim Mohammed El-Madhoun, 21, from Al-Ama'ri refugee camp, wounded with a live
bullet in the left knee; and<br>
3) Mahmoud Ayyoub Rommana, 14, from Al-Ama'ri refugee camp, wounded with a live bullet in
the foot.<br>
<br>
At the entrance to the village of Deir Nezham near Ramallah, Israeli occupation soldiers
opened fire on a number of Palestinian demonstrators after the Friday Prayer, wounding:<br>
<br>
1) Mohammed Hussein El-Tamimi, 40, with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the left arm;<br>

<br>
At approximately 17:00 local time, at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, the child Ahmed
Abdel-Raziq Abed Rabbo Abu Houli, 15, from Deir El-Balah, was pronounced dead from a wound
in the abdomen he received earlier that day. &nbsp;According to an eyewitness, Abu Houli
was on his way to his uncle's house located to the southeast of Kfar Darom settlement in
Deir El-Balah when he was shot by Israeli soldiers 700m away. &nbsp;The soldiers were
positioned on top of a tank located at the entrance of Abu Houli road, an access road to
Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the north and south of the Gaza Strip. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The eyewitness, who was also walking on Abu Houli Road approximately 200m behind the
child, added that the Israeli occupation soldiers unjustifiably fired one live bullet at
the child who then fell to the ground. &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the Israeli occupation
forces sprayed the area with bullets, preventing the provision of help to the wounded
child. &nbsp;Five minutes later, when the shooting stopped, the eyewitnesses carried the
child. &nbsp;He ran approximately 200m to where the child was put<br>
into a civilian car, which then transported him to an ambulance. &nbsp;The child was
transferred to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, where he died approximately two hours later.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
At approximately 13:30 local time, the child Mohammed Hamdi El-Battash, 12, from
Al-Shojae'ya neighborhood in Gaza city, was wounded with a live bullet in the mouth,
resulting in the loss of his teeth and lips. &nbsp;He was evacuated to Palestinian Red
Crescent Society's Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City. &nbsp;PCHR's field officer in Gaza City
reported that El-Battash was among approximately 50 Palestinian children who were
demonstrating 150m to the north of Israeli soldiers' position in the middle of the road
between Al-Shuhada' (Netzarim) junction (south of Gaza City) and Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet

<br>
According to eyewitnesses, the bus was traveling on bypass road 60, to the west of

clashes in the area.<br>
<br>
At approximately 8:30 local time, Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinian civilian
cars near Rafat junction, connected with a bypass road to the southwest of Ramallah.
&nbsp;According to eyewitnesses, a Ford vehicle suddenly deviated from its course and

opened fire on the above Palestinian civilian car from a distance of 3m, killing its
driver A'attef Ahmed El-Nabulsi, 35, with live bullets in the neck and the chest. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The forces prevented a Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulance from transporting
El-Nabulsi's body to Ramallah and instead took the body to an Israeli military site, known
as &quot;Ofar&quot; near Betounia. &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the ambulance was released
but El-Nabulsi's body was not released until 18:00 local time. &nbsp;During the same

In the morning, the Israeli forces assinated Maso'ud Hussein A'yyad, 50, from Al-Zaytoun
neighborhood in Gaza City and a major in Force 17 (the Palestinian President's guards).
&nbsp;This is the latest in a growing record of assassinations and extra-judicial killings
that are part of a policy adopted by the Israeli government in blatant violation of
International Humanitarian Law. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
At approximately 9:45 local time, an Israeli combat helicopter flew over Gaza City and
fired three rockets at a Palestinian civilian car, a white Hyundai. &nbsp;This car was

tear gas inhalation. &nbsp;According to medical sources at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis,
16 victims were transferred to the intensive care unit due to the seriousness of their
condition. &nbsp;The sources asserted that the unique symptoms raised suspicions that the
Israeli occupation forces were using new and virulent gas. &nbsp;The hospital lacked the
technical means to identify the gas used. &nbsp;PCHR will refer to international experts
on this subject.<br>
<br>
PCHR's field officer in Khan Yunis reported that fear and panic swept Khan Yunis as
Palestinian civilians were forced to flee their homes in order to escape the shelling and
shooting which caused severe damage to dozens of houses. &nbsp;PCHR's field officer has
not been able yet to reach all the affected houses to check the damage due to the
continuing&nbsp; danger. &nbsp;However, the field officer was able to reach the following
houses:<br>

<br>
In his testimony to PCHR, Anwar Hassan Kalloub said that he was with his 8-member family
inside their 250-square-meter, asbestos roofed house, when they heard sounds of explosions
and shooting. &nbsp;They then sheltered in a room thought to be more secure. &nbsp;It is
worth mentioning that Kalloub's house has been shelled more than once during the past four
months. &nbsp;He and his family were forced to leave it and rent an apartment in a more
secure area. &nbsp;Kalloub, who used to work in Israel before the current siege was
imposed, added that due to his deteriorating economic circumstances, he was forced to go
back to his house, which is only 50m away from a military site of the Israeli occupation
forces. &nbsp;During the most recent shelling, the door of the house was hit with two
artillery shells and shrapnel covered the house.<br>
<br>
At approximately 23:30 local time, Israeli forces positioned near Tal Al-Sultan roadblock,
which separates Rafah from its Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area also under the control of
these forces, shelled an electricity transmitter in Tal Al-Sultan neighborhood. &nbsp;This
cut electricity in Rafah for half an hour while electricity in Tal Al-Sultan neighborhood
had not been restored. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>

and heavy and medium caliber bullets at several areas in the refugee camp and at Al-Derda
neighborhood in the nearby town of Halhoul, causing severe damage to Palestinian houses.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The shelling coincided with similar shelling by Israeli forces positioned in a military
site called &quot;Ush El-Ghorab&quot; in Bethlehem. &nbsp;The forces targeted Palestinian
houses and the headquarters of the Christian Youth Community in Beit Sahour. &nbsp;The
shelling, which lasted for about 45 minutes, also targeted the refugee camps of A'aida and
Al-A'zzeh in Bethlehem. &nbsp;At midnight, Israeli forces also shelled: the Iraq
neighborhood, the vicinity of Marni Claus, the Orthodox Club, Al-Sahel in Bethlehem and
olive mills in Bethlehem.<br>
<br>
1. Razing of Agricultural Land and Demolition of Houses<br>
<br>
Thursday, February 8, 2001 <br>
<br>
The Israeli forces ordered 22 Palestinian families to leave their houses in the Khan Yunis
Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area, under the control of these forces. &nbsp;These oral
notifications are an initial step toward shelling the houses and leveling agricultural
areas in the area of Tal Reidan, adjacent to Gush Qatif settlement block. &nbsp;It is
clear that the Israeli occupation forces intend to expell Palestinian residents of the
area in order to pave the way for its annexation to Jewish settlements. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
PCHR is representing the Palestinian citizens in their challenge of the evacuation.
&nbsp;PCHR's lawyers have commenced legal procedures with the legal advisor of the Israeli
occupation forces demanding a stop to the evacuations. &nbsp;PCHR has not yet received a
response. &nbsp;PCHR also plans to challenge the notices in the Israeli High Court.
&nbsp;Although these houses were not demolished after the notice expired on February 11,
2001, the area continues to be threatened by the Israeli occupation forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Monday, February 12, 2001 <br>
<br>
<br>
At approximately 2:00 local time, the Israeli occupation forces started to raze more areas
of Palestinian agricultural land and demolish Palestinian houses to the south of Kfar
Darom settlement in the middle region of the Gaza Strip. &nbsp;The affected area is 600m
south of the settlement and 200m west of Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the
north and south of the Gaza Strip). &nbsp;PCHR's field officer in the middle area reported
that the Israeli forces:<br>
<br>
1) Razed an eight-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Farouq and
Majed Mohammed El-Ja'farawi, and destroyed a well, a water motor and an irrigation
network.<br>
2) Demolished a 150-square-meter, one-story house, in which nine people used to live,
located on the aforementioned leveled tract of land, owned by Salman Abed Rabbo Al-O'mour,
who oversees the land. &nbsp;Furniture of the house was destroyed and an animal farm was
demolished. <br>
<br>
Wednesday, February 14, 2001 <br>
<br>
At approximately 2:00 local time, the Israeli forces razed a two-donum area of
agricultural land planted with vegetables, owned by Ahmed Khalil Abu Samra and located to
the northeast of Kfar Darom settlement. &nbsp;The forces also demolished a
120-square-meter house, the aforementioned resident used as an agricultural store.
&nbsp;It is worth mentioning that the Israeli occupation forces razed approximately 20
donums of agricultural land owned by the same resident over the course of the past weeks. <br>
<br>
PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to immediately intervene to stop
the killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against
Palestinian civilians. &nbsp;PCHR calls in particular for:<br>
<br>
1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in accordance with UN
Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry out a thorough and comprehensive
investigation into the abuses and killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces
against Palestinian civilians. <br>
2. Convening a conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention
of 1949 to ensure Israel's compliance with its obligations under the Convention. <br>
3. Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian civilians in the
occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the<br>
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces and groups of
Jewish settlers who move under the protection of these forces. <br>
4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic measures with reference to Article 2
of the Euro-Israel Association Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights. <br>
5. Providing humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose living
conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the continued total siege imposed by
the Israeli occupation forces on the entire occupied Palestinian territories. <br>
