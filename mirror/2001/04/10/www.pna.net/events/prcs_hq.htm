<br>
Friday Feb. 9.&nbsp; Last night PRCS headquarters and central ambulance dispatch in
Ramallah were fired upon and hit several times with heavy &amp; explosive cannon fire
causing the top floor to catch fire.&nbsp; Israeli army gunners from the nearby hilltop
settlement of Psagot fired continuously into the area for over 3 hours.&nbsp; Ambulance
dispatch was paralyzed during this period.<br>
However, during this period, paramedics managed to respond to a call from a nearby home
that was on fire.&nbsp; The crew evacuated the residents, extinguished the fire (fire
trucks could not reach the area due to heavy shelling) and provided first aid.<br>
<br>
All telephone lines and the central 101 telephone for ambulance dispatch were also hit and
cut for the Ramallah region.&nbsp; Other damages included 3 water tanks on the roof top,
and the PRCS mini-bus for the disabled. PRCS HQ was also hit and damaged on Dec 31, 2000.
&nbsp; No injuries were reported.<br>
<br>
PRCS is dismayed at this pattern of behavior by the Israeli army showing complete lack of
respect for our medical humanitarian mission and activities.&nbsp; However, as we have
always stated, we will continue to provide emergency medical services to all in need, both
Israeli and Palestinian.<br>
<br>
We again ask Red Cross/Red Crescent societies, the movement, and the ICRC to protest these
actions in the strongest of terms.<br>

PRCS President<br>
Younis Al-Khatib<br>
