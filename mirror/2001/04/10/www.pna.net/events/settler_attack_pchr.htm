<p><strong><font color="#B80000">Israeli Settlers Attack Palestinian Civilians and their
Properties in Khan Younis<br>
</font></strong><br>
<br>
Date: January 15, 2001<br>
<br>
In one of the most recent attacks, perpetrated by Israeli forces and settlers against
Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, more than 150 settlers attacked the
Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area West of Khan Younis. &nbsp;The area is under Israeli
military control. &nbsp;They set fire to a number of houses and civilians buildings.<br>
<br>
According to eyewitnesses, at about 12:30 this afternoon, 150 armed settlers from the
settlements of Kfar Yam, Netzer Hazani, and Neve Dekalim under full protection from
Israeli soldiers attacked and set fire to six beach front coffee shops owned by
Palestinians from Khan Younis. &nbsp;Two houses, belonging to Ibrahim Yousef Al-Laham, and
Said Abdulla Al-Najar, were burned down. &nbsp;Settlers also burned a cattle barn, and
many green houses owned by Palestinian civilians. &nbsp;Much agricultural land was also
destroyed by settlers in the attack. &nbsp;The settlers fired guns in the air intimidating
local residents and forcing them to remain in their homes. &nbsp;The attack lasted until
2:00 pm, when Israeli soldiers intervened and forced the settlers to leave. Because the
Israeli Occupation forces have closed the area PCHR has not been able to gather further
informaion about this attack. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Last night and early this morning Israeli occupation forces brought more forces into the
Al-Mawasi area. &nbsp;Palestinian houses were searched. &nbsp;Sabri Said Al-Najar (the son
of Said Al-Najar) was arrested. &nbsp;Civilians were forced to stay in their homes due to
an unofficial curfew. &nbsp;The two main roads leading from Khan Younis and Rafah to the
Al-Mawasi area were closed by Israeli forces (the crossings at Al-Tufah and Tel-Sultan).
&nbsp;In additional all of the smaller roads leading to the area were blocked by Israeli
occupation forces.<br>
<br>
PCHR calls upon the international community to intervene immediately to stop the grave
human rights violations perpetrated by Israeli forces and settlers against Palestinian
civilians. &nbsp;PCHR reiterates its demand that the High Contracting Parties to the
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 take effective measures to ensure the implementation of
the agreement by Israel in the Occupied Territories, and to live up to their own
obligations, by providing protection for Palestinian civilians in the Occupied
Territories. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
