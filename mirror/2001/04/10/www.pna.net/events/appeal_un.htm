Council:<br>
<br>
End the Israeli Occupation and Provide International Protection for the Palestinian People</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#B80000"><strong>14 March 2001<br>
</strong></font><br>
<br>
Israeli occupation forces began, on Sunday 12 March 2001, implementing a plan called
&quot;One Hundred Days&quot;. The scheme involves imposing a comprehensive closure on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The plan was drawn up during Barak's term but was recently
ratified by the new government of Ariel Sharon. Accordingly, about 90 military blockades
would be added to toughen Israeli siege of Palestinian areas isolating refugee camps and
villages from major cities and dividing the West Bank into sixty isolated sectors. With
such measures, the government of Ariel Sharon is taking a major step towards escalating
the crisis to a very dangerous level that could lead the region to the brink of war.<br>
Clearly, the Israeli government aims to smother the Palestinian people and to destroy
atheir economic base and the infrastructure of their society. Such repressive measures
emphasize Israeli intransigence and their denial of Palestinian legitimate rights.<br>
The Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace (PCJP) warns of the grave consequences of
Israeli oppressive policies against the Palestinian people. We also portend of the
destructive ramifications of the Israeli siege on the economic, social and humanitarian
aspects of Palestinian life.<br>
The present conditions under which Palestinians live are intolerable. <br>
The extensive suffering, resulting from Israeli repressive measures, would fuel animosity
and hatred that could in turn engulf the region in an endless cycle of violence and
counter-violence.<br>
Although Israel has been occupying the Palestinian Territories of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since 1967, the United Nations and its Security Council have failed to implement UN
Resolutions that called for total Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Palestinian
Territories including Jerusalem, namely, Resolutions 242 and 338.In light of Israeli
persistent refusal to honor international agreements signed with the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), and the lack of effective and serious international efforts to compel
Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian Territories, occupied in June 1967, places the
responsibility into your hands to see to it that Israel complies with its international
obligations.<br>
The PCJP calls upon all peace-loving elements in the world to immediately intervene and
put an end to Israeli repressive measures. Additionally, we call for an immediate
intervention by the European Union and the five permanent member states of the UN Security
Council to provide protection for the Palestinian people through deployment of
international forces. The presence of these forces would create the atmosphere necessary
to resume peace negotiations. At the same time, these forces would potentially play a
significant role to safeguard any peace agreement that could be concluded with the state
of Israel in the future.<br>
