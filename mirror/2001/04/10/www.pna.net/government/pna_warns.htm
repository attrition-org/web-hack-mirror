<p align="left">Ramallah &#150; The Palestinian National Authority warned today against
increasing Israeli military escalation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip adding that it
can lead to an unprecedented explosion in the region.</p>

<p align="left">An official statement published today (Wednesday, February 14, 2001) by
the Palestine Media Center- PMC said &#147;the military activities being carried out by
the Israeli occupation army, against unarmed innocent civilians in Khan Younis, Beit Jala,
Beit Sahour, Al-Bireh, and other Palestinian areas, require an immediate serious
international movement, to prevent Barak from paying for his partnership with the coming
Sharon government in Palestinian blood.&#148;</p>

<p align="left">The PMC added that &#147;the recent Israeli escalation, which included
shelling, destruction of property, and assassinations comes during the last days of the
Barak government, and sends a clear signal on the hostile nature of the ongoing
deliberations on forming a coalition government in Israel.</p>

<p align="left">The PMC&#146;s statement stressed that &#147;Israeli violence can only
breed counter violence and cited the bus attack this morning south of Tel-Aviv which
resulted in the death of 9 Israeli soldiers, adding that this incident came as an expected
response to shelling, assassinations, and use of poisonous gases against the Palestinians,
who have also been under a choking military and economic siege since more than 4 months.</p>

<p align="left">The PMC concluded its statement saying that &#147;the international
community should recognize the grave danger associated with the current Israeli military
escalation&#148;, adding that &#147;the Palestinians who have made every possible
concession for the sake of establishing peace and security in the region will continue in
their legitimate struggle to achieve their national rights recognized by the world
community including their right of return, and establishing an independent Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital. </p>
