<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman,<br>
Your Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt">Convening the South
summit in Havana, the capital of the friendly republic of Cuba, at the threshold of the
third millennium, reflects the deep responsibility that the leaders of the South and the
PRC bear vis-à-vis the contemporary world order. This order witnessed over recent years
tremendous changes in the field of international relations, which were accompanied by
scientific and technological progress, a revolution in information and communications, and
economic globalizm. This historic Summit of the Countries of the South and the PRC is
called upon to put down joint plans and strategies to face up and absorb the accelerating
international changes, to consolidate the plans of joint cooperation among the countries
of the South and to start the North-South dialogue in the light of these joint plans and
strategies of the countries of the South in order to achieve development, equality and
international stability.<O:P></O:P> &nbsp;<O:P> </span></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman,<br>
Your Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt">&nbsp;<O:P> While having
before it an abundant<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>agenda, this summit of
the South and the PRC contributes in an effective way to the international efforts being
made to create a world order that provides peoples with equal opportunities to benefit
from the great progress achieved in the fields of science and technology, and that puts a
strong foundation for constructive cooperation between the North and the South. Globalism
is currently progressing. The whole world is being reformulated through the technological,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>information and communications revolutions. The
historic task of the Summit of the South and the PRC lies in using this tremendous
scientific progress in the national and popular plans of development and on the basis of
joint cooperation among the countries of the South and the constructive cooperation
between North and South.<O:P></O:P> &nbsp;<O:P></span></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman,<br>
Your Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt">&nbsp;<O:P> </span>The
Middle East, and Palestine its center and quintessence, has been suffering since the
beginning of the Twentieth century, from colonialism, division, occupation and aggression.
This is so because of the onslaught of foreign and colonial powers and their struggle to
control it and its important strategic position. These struggles intensified after the
discovery of huge natural riches in the Middle East, especially the discovery of oil, gas,
and other natural resources, which form the lifeline of modern industry in the industrial
countries and in all the countries of the world. The Middle East and Palestine, were a
theater of foreign aggression and local wars for half a century that aimed at controlling
them and their natural resources and at perpetuating their regional division.</p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The Palestinian people, their entity and Holy Land, were the
first victim of all wars and aggression. Our Palestinian people were expelled from their
homeland in 1948. The State of Israel was established on part of the historical land of
Palestine following the United Nations Resolution 181 that called for the partition of
Palestine into two states in 1947. The State of Israel, as you know, was established but
the State of Palestine was not, due to the colonial conspiracies and intrigues as well as
due to the Israel&#146;s denial to resolution 181 and its continued aggression against the
Palestinian and Arab lands, and due to its throwing our people outside their homeland into
the Diaspora, refugee-camps and exiles.</p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Fifty years have passed and yet the Palestinian people are
still deprived of exercising their right of self-determination and of establishing their
independent state on their national soil. Our people have however, owing to your support,
help and solidarity, continued their legitimate and just struggle to regain their land and
their national rights to self-determination, the return of the dissipated refigures and
the establishment of their independent state of Palestine, with Holy Jerusalem as its
capital.</p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Following the Madrid Peace Conference and the negotiations in
Washington, we concluded with the Government of Israel the Oslo Agreement to realize a
just, lasting and comprehensive peace. The Oslo Peace Agreement, however, faced fatal
strikes following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, my partner in peace, the peace of
the brave, at the hands of an extremist Israeli settler. The peace process was hindered
for a long period. The Oslo agreement was frozen. All other agreements that followed were
obstructed and frozen, namely those done under the auspices of President Clinton and
President Mubarak, with the support of the European countries, Federal Russia, China,
Japan, the Non- aligned Countries, and the fraternal Arab and other friendly states. Four
difficult years have passed without making any significant progress in the peace process.
Despite this dangerous situation, we have maintained the choice of peace, and that also
despite what our people and land face, in terms of settlement aggressions, the
confiscation of land, the judauzation of Jerusalem and encirclement of the Town of
Bethlehem- the birth place of Jesus Christ, peace be upon him- with settlement blocks in
order to put obstacles in front of us as we are building the foundations of our
independent state.&nbsp;<O:P></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman,<br>
Your Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;<O:P> Peace in the Middle East starts in Palestine exactly
as war in the Middle East flares out of Palestine. For the cause Palestine and the agony
of the Palestinian people who were thrown out of their homeland, the Middle East will not
experience stability. And its peoples will not enjoy peace unless our people realize their
national and legitimate rights, including their right to freedom and independence, and
unless the Israeli withdrawal takes place from the occupied Palestinian and Arab
Territories, in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy, including
242, 338, 425 and 252 on Jerusalem as well as their right to establish their Palestinian
independent state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, and solving the question of
refugees and their right to return to their homes. </p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">We declare, in front of you, our total adhesion to the
resolutions of the international legitimacy, to the principle of land for peace in
accordance with the Madrid Peace Conference and to the official agreements signed between
us and the Government of Israel in Oslo, Washington, Cairo, Wye River and Sharm-al-Sheikh.
On the basis of this firm commitment to international legitimacy and the agreements and
the dates set there in, we declare, in front of you, that this year is the year of the
establishment of the independent state of Palestine and according to the agreements, that
date is 13 September 2000.</p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The Palestinian people look up to the Summit of the South to
stand at their side while they are establishing their independent state of Palestine as
they have stood at the side of our people over the years of struggle and peoples
intifada-uprising in Palestine.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman,<br>
Your Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the international, US, European, and
Arab efforts will be crowned with success, for ensuring the implementation by the Israeli
side of these agreements within the fixed dates established for them, especially following
the historic Berlin Declaration on behalf of the European Union, the historic visits of
President Clinton to our homeland, Palestine, and the visit of His Holiness the Pope, the
celebration of the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ, peace be upon
him, in Bethlehem, and the visit of those esteemed guests to us.</p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman,<br>
Your Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;May I wish the summit of the South and the PRC
success in realizing their aims and in formulating their programs and policies that will
strengthen the fruitful cooperation among their states. I wish them success, as well, in
putting firm foundations for joint international cooperation in a way that ensures
equality, development and international stability.</p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Peace and the mercy of God be upon you and the blessings of
God be with you. </p>
