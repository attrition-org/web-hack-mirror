By <br>
The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation(MOPIC)</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seven months ago, the then head of the Israeli opposition, Ariel
Sharon, staged an outright provocation on Thursday 28<sup>th</sup> September 2000, by
invading the <i>Haram El-Sharif</i>, escorted by a huge military force, in violation of
the status quo prevailing on the Haram, under the pretext of a private visit. This gross
violation of all rules, laws and agreements, was met with mass Palestinian peaceful
protest. Yet, the occupation forces faced these protests with shockingly excessive use of
force that led to seven months of bloodshed with more than 400 Palestinian martyrs and
over 15,000 injured. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same staged manner, the current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, on Thursday 5<sup>th</sup> April 2001, gave orders to the Israeli security forces
to enable Jews to enter the <i>Haram El-Sharif</i>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, Mr. Ariel Sharon is deliberately looking for more bloodshed
that will not be restricted to Jerusalem but will spread to the entire region. This new
provocation and act of aggression is a clear invitation by Mr. Sharon to change the course
of the ongoing conflict and take it beyond the boundaries of Palestine and Israel. This
act not only violates the status quo in Jerusalem, but is also in contravention of
international law, international conventions and all professed Israeli commitments to
peace. It is also against the ruling of the Israeli High Court of Justice on Thursday 5<sup>th</sup>
April 2001, that rejected the petition by the &quot;<i>Temple Mount Faithful&quot;</i>
group to order the government to allow them to pray on the <i>Haram El-Sharif</i> during
the Pessah holiday. Moreover, it is against the Israeli Police statement to the High Court
where the Israeli Police believed that such an act would &quot;trigger bloodshed in
Jerusalem and throughout Israel&quot;. Prime Minister Sharon's latest provocation
accompanied by his decision to build new settlements, is a crystal clear challenge to the
international community and to international law. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We regret to see such alarming messages sent to us by the Israeli
Government after our endless efforts to restore negotiations and put an end to seven
months of bloodshed. The meeting in Athens between Dr. Nabeel Sha'ath and Mr. Shimon
Peres, under the auspices of the EU is a clear example of our commitment. The security
meeting under the auspices of the USA was another example of both our sincere efforts and
Israeli aggression, since it concluded with an assassination attempt against the heads of
our security forces at the Beit Hanoun checkpoint on 4<sup>th</sup> April 2001. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian leadership urges your esteemed Government to do
everything possible to prevent the region from a potential catastrophe that will be beyond
any control if the Israeli Government proceeds in its provocative and war-seeking
approach. Moreover, we hope that your Government will put pressure on the Israeli
Government to respect: international law and refrain from any provocative policies, mainly
in Jerusalem and including all settlement activities. Those are actions that will lead to
further deterioration on the local level, which will in turn lead to further deterioration
in the whole region. </p>
