<p><b>The News Hour with Jim Lehrer</b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEWSMAKER</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">JIM LEHRER:</b> Secretary of State Colin Powell is about to make his
first trip to the Middle East. In preparation officials of both sides in the conflict have
come to Washington for preliminary talks, Last week we spoke with a representative of
Israeli Prime Minister Elect Sharon who was here. And tonight we'll have a Palestinian
view of the stalemate and violence in the Middle East.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> with me is Nabil Sha'ath, a senior advisor to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and minister of planning in the Palestinian Authority.
He's a veteran of years of Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations, including the foiled
talks at Camp David last July. He met with Secretary Powell today. Welcome Mr. Sha'ath.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABIL SHA'ATH:</b> Thank you.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> What is Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian looking
for from Secretary Powell and this new Bush administration?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABIL SHA'ATH:</b> We'd like to see the same commitment to the peace
process in the Middle East as we have seen with Mr. Clinton and with Mr. Bush Sr. before
him. We'd like to see involvement and we'd like to see a real attempt at keeping the terms
of reference, international, legality - resolutions 242 and 338 - which meat in Jordan and
Egypt and Lebanon withdrawal to the borders of the 1967.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> How did Secretary Powell respond when you said
this to him that you wanted deep involvement by the Bush administration?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, I think he was positive. He very clearly has
not yet formulated the full policy guidelines for this administration, and he's going to
visit the Middle East very soon. He's going to meet with President Arafat and with the
leaders of the area. I think he is in the process of formulating a different strategy.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> But he has said and the new President Bush has
also said that they thought President Clinton and his people were too deeply involved and
that basically the US role should be to step back and let the Palestinians and Israelis
work it out. I think Powell said last week, you know, jawboning is pretty much all we can
do right now. I mean, how does that sit with you?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, remember in the Oslo agreement, we and the
Israelis did it alone.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> Of '93.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> '93, and also the immediate negotiations afterwards
which I led on the Palestinian side and the general led on the Israeli side what become
known as the Gaza - Jericho agreement we did without any intervention from the United
States.. But that was in the days in which there was euphoria about the peace process and
mutual trust. With the present situation, without that trust and with the continued
occupied by the Israelis of our territory and putting us under real siege, you still need
the&#133; an activist policy by the United States to get this peace process going and to
end the occupation.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> All right. Let's turn to your view of this Israeli
government and what that means for the Palestinians. First of all, your reaction to the
news today that the defeated prime minister - Barak - will not be joining Prime Minister -
Elect Sharon's government.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, I think this is really a matter that the
Labor Party finally had to decide - as Mr. Barak was the leaders of the Labor Party. The
Labor Party and its supporters in Israel saw that they could not continue to give their
trust to Mr. Barak. They feel that his defeat, which was partly caused by the many
supporters of the Labor Party including the Israeli Arabs refrained from voting indicated
that he could not continue - particularly with Mr. Sharon as his defense minister. It's
really an internal matter in the Labor Party and in Israel.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> But the new President.. The new prime minister
Sharon has made clear he's not willing to offer the same things that Barak offered to
Palestinians. In retrospect do you think the Palestinians missed a bet not accepting the
deal Barak offered at Camp David in July and instead essentially letting this uprising
flower?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, I mean if you look at what has been done in
Taba, you see that Taba so much better.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> This was the later meeting you had in Egypt.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEL SHA'ATH:</b> Exactly. The last meeting just before the elections
we did much better. There was a lot of progress. There was more progress that could have
been achieved had it not been for the onest of these elections. Camp David, there was some
progress no doubt. It was not enough for the Palestinians. After years of struggle for
their freedom - for their independence, after making the greatest concession when they
gave up struggling for all their country with the exception of the 22%, the West Bank and
Gaza, it was not good enough. It could not have settled for it.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> But now Prime Minister - Elect Sharon is saving
all those things are off the table. Barak offering 95% of the West Bank, offering
Palestinian sovereignty over part of Jerusalem. Where does that leave you?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Now, the present situation is&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot
possibly lead to any peace and cannot lead to an agreement. I think the Israeli people
knew it and know it. It was really their election of Sharon was much more a protest
against Barak than it was really deserting the peace process.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARENER:</b> But the Sharon people say it was also a protest
against the uprising and the violence and that they wanted to elect somebody who they
thought would bring security never mind a peace deal.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> You cannot bring security without real peace. What
this thing is all about is a just peace, and eight years the Palestinian accepted to
negotiate and to deal with any violence inside or outside them and succeeded. The question
of violence came when I think the Palestinian people felt that it was impossible to
continue that occupation without a real protest.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> I'm trying to get at here how you read this new
incoming government, if he manages to create one. Now, Moshe Arons who is a key adviser to
Sharon was on the show last week. He said a permanent settlement was not attainable at
this time, that all Sharon wants is some sort of an interim deal that ends the violence
and freezes&#133; He didn't say what it would involve, but an interim deal. Do you expect
more?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> We spent ten years of interimness, and that's it
Look at the map. The map today shows 42% of the west bank has been given back to the
Palestinians and three regimes, a, b, and c. All of them are in little bundles, little
blocks totally separated from each other in a sea of Israeli occupation and increasing
settlement activities. This is an impossible situation. If Mr. Sharon thinks this is a
solution, this is prescription for further conflict.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> but what is your reasonable expectation about
where he's going and what he's willing to do?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, we don't know exactly what he's going to do.
He's unable apparently to from a unity government. And that is part of the reason why Mr.
Barak had to resign. If he doesn't form a unity government and forms an extreme right
government, this really cannot survive. We don't know yet if he's really capable of
putting a government that can stay and for how long. And it is quite possible that the
Israeli people, after the shock wears off and after there is a real attempt at
reconciliation seems possible to the Israeli people, that he is not going to be the man
who is going to make real peace, that somebody will have to come from the ranks of the
Israelis that once again will put that peace process on the table and than make a real
attempt at making it.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> So you're counting on Sharon being a short - term
Prime Minister? Is that you're say something.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, some people say there is little chance that
the man can change.. That begin changed and made the peace with Egypt, that Mr. DeKlerk
changed and made the peace with Mandela. It is possible. It is very improbable though.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> Now he has also said and Mr. Arens said on the
show last week that he's not even going to sit down and talk about anything: An interim
agree, anything, until essentially the uprising stops, the violence in the streets stops.
Is Arafat, one, able and, two, willing to deliver on that from the Palestinian end?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> Well, the question really has to be looked at two
sides. We are for a real solution that will stop the violence and will continue the peace
process. But it is impossible to see it only from the point of view of Israel, of the
Israeli right. The Israelis are in actual occupation. Their tanks crisscross our
territory. Gaza alone is divided into five little pieces today. Our economy is under siege
and GNP had fallen by 50%. 60% of our people are unemployed. What violence? The occupation
is one of the greatest violence we have seen. It has to be done by both sides. It has to
be done in a concerted way so that the violence is reduced as the occupation is reduced
and as the siege is reduced. We need to really look at it also from the point of view of a
political light at the end of the tunnel. The two things have to go together. Maybe peace
is the best guarantee of security and not just the other way around.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> but are you suggesting then that things may have
to get worse before they get better or than the cycle of killing is going to continue?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NABEIL SHA'ATH:</b> I hope not Here is a role for Mr. Powell. I hope
his visit will lend to a positive&#133; the United States' role that would stop that
escalation of violence, that will stop the excessive use of force by the Israelis and
would bring this all towards a much better situation.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MARGARET WARNER:</b> All right Mr. Sha'ath, thanks for being with us.</p>
