<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam High Commissioner, Mr Chairman, Excellencies, Ladies and
gentlemen, Dear friends, </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allow me to convey to you the greetings of the people of Palestine and
their leadership, who highly appeciate your efforts to follow up the tragic developments
in our region and to try and respond to the aggravating situation of Human rights in the
Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. Thanks to High Commisoner Mary
Robinson, for her brave trip to our land, to the International Commission of Inquiry, to
Special Rapporteur Mr; Giacomelli, and thanks to you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Human rights, and the setting of universally binding norms of respect
for human rights, is one of the major forms of progress that the world has witnessed for a
half-century, indeed since the foundation of the UN system, the adoption of the UN Charter
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This progress, unfortunately, does not mean
that human rights are less violated in practice, but it means that these violations are no
longer deemed morally or legally acceptable. Practices once considered as legitimate means
of war, or of government, have come to be defined as crimes. This has been the case with
the practice of torture; this was the case with mass deportation and collective
imprisonment at the beginning of the last century; this was the case with the use of gas
during 1st World War. Recently, anti-personal landmines have been banned. The norms of
what is and is not acceptable are indeed moving, and we should ask ourselves, today,
whether we are doing enough to see to it that no violation of human rights, in principle
and/or in practice, is ever deemed acceptable anywhere and under any circumstances. If
such an awareness had existed earlier, and had the world been vigilant, such horrendous
twentieth-century tragedies as the &quot;Holocaust&quot; may have never been allowed to
happen. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence the importance of this session. Hence the importance of Palestine
as an item on this session&#146;s agenda. For ultimately, what we have to decide in the
course of the coming days is whether the present and allegedly &#147;low level&#148; cruel
and murderous war waged by Israel against the people of Palestine will be allowed to go on
as &#147;a necessary set of security measures&#148;, and to set, as a result, a norm for
&#147;acceptable&#148; crimes. The present siege and aggression conducted by the Israeli
occupation forces must never be accepted as a necessary evil needed to maintain an illegal
occupation. Only a day before yesterday, Israeli combat helicopters, once again, bombed
Gaza and Ramallah, while in Hebron-El Khalil settlers went on rampage and organized
&#147;pogroms&#148; against Palestinian inhabitants. Daily, children and old people, women
and men are murdered, or locked in and starved, in the attempt to terrorize our people
into submission. Today our cities and villages are under new attacks, and settlers have
invaded the Abu Sneineh neighborhood of Hebron, while the occupation army escalates its
aggressive operations.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Chairman,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear friends,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not engage in an attempt to describe the Human rights situation
in the occupied Palestinian territory. This situation is known to the distinguished
members of this Commission. Excellent reports have been established by the Special
Committee on Israeli practices affecting Human rights in the occupied Arab territories as
well as by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
People, which document abundantly the dramatic situation of Human rights under Israeli
occupation. Most recently, High Commissioner Mary Robinson concluded her mission with a
report that shall remain as a milestone of political courage and devotion to the truth and
respect for the facts. But we must also salute YMCA, YWCA, Amnesty International, the
FIDH, B&#146;Tselem, the Law Society, Al Haq, PHRC, and all the International, Palestinian
and Israeli Human rights organizations and NGOs who have, for many years now, followed and
reported on human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territory. They are almost
all present among us today, and the invaluable data they have collected and documented is
also available here. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like, however, to express my, and the PLO's, deep appreciation
for the clarity and insight contained in the report that has been presented at this 57th
session by the human rights inquiry commission established pursuant to Commission
resolution s-5/1 of 19 October 2000 to investigate violations of human rights and
humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories after 28 September 2000. That
report concludes with several recommendations, including the following: </p>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The framework for a final peaceful settlement and the process
    through which it is pursued should be guided at all stages by respect for human rights and
    humanitarian law and the full application of international human rights standards set out
    in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in applicable human rights instruments,
    in particular those relating to women, children and refugees.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An adequate and effective international presence needs to be
    established to monitor and regularly report on compliance by all parties with human rights
    and humanitarian law standards in order to ensure full protection of the human rights of
    the people of the occupied territories. Such an international mechanism should be
    established immediately and constituted in such a manner as to reflect a sense of urgency
    about protecting the human rights of the Palestinian people.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protection needs to be accorded to the people of the occupied
    territories in strict compliance with the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the
    Protection of Civilians in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention). The High Contracting
    Parties, individually and collectively, need urgently to take appropriate and effective
    action to respond to an emergency situation calling for measures to alleviate the daily
    suffering of the Palestinian people flowing from the severe breaches of the Fourth Geneva
    Convention. Article One of the Convention places a duty on the High Contracting Parties
    &quot;to respect and ensure respect&quot; of the provisions of the Convention &quot;in all
    circumstances&quot;.&quot; </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the report recommends that the High Contracting Parties
should act with urgency to reconvene the Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the
Fourth Geneva Convention, first convened in Geneva on 15 July 1999, and ìsuch a
Conference should establish an effective international mechanism for taking the urgent
measures needed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These recommendations coincide with those made in the report made by
the High Commissioner on her visit to the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Egypt
and Jordan (8-16 November 2000). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can add little to these prudent and responsible findings. However, no
Palestinian can avoid concluding that over the past three decades the one thing that has
stood between such reasonable and legally self-evident conclusions and their
implementation has been a deficit of political will to make the law work. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madame High Commissioner, Your Excellencies,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us accept our part of the blame.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some ten years ago, prior to the convening of the Madrid Conference,
former United States Secretary of State James Baker pointedly asked his Palestinian
interlocutors whether they wanted to clean up Israel's occupation by insisting on Israel's
de jure commitment to the fourth Geneva Convention to end that occupation by negotiating a
political settlement. At that time, the answer seemed obvious. We needed to put an end to
occupation, and to achieve a long-lasting peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were not deterred from entering into interim arrangements of an
unprecedented nature by the fact that Israel maintained its refusal as an Occupying Power
to accept the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied
Palestinian territories, or to respect it in practice. We were not deterred by the failure
othe other High Contracting Parties to take effective measures up to that point to ensure
Israel's respect. We were confident that, as we focused our efforts on building dialogue,
cooperation and confidence between the Palestinian and Israeli national societies and
their political leaderships, the political will to respect and ensure respect for the
Fourth Geneva Convention would be found, by Israel, and, if not, by the other High
Contracting Parties who were highly invested in the success of the process. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We maintained our cooperation and commitment to political dialogue as
Israelís unlawful unilateral annexation measures and settlement programmes continued to
transform and devastate the territorial, demographic and institutional habitat of the
Palestinian population under occupation, causing great and palpable harm to their physical
security and social and economic welfare, and creating facts that, if not reversed, would
permanently frustrate the Palestinian people's exercise of their right to
self-determination through the establishment of an adequately resourced and sovereign
Palestinian state. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We persisted, despite mounting reservations, in the face of Israel's
other unremitting violations of international humanitarian law, the unnecessary and
unjustifiable harm that they continued to cause to the Palestinian civilian population,
and the violence that they embodied.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, after the hard lessons of the past ten years, and the unproductive
final efforts made at Camp David and Taba, the Palestinian leadership can not but
recognise that Israelís systematic and persistent violations of international human
rights and humanitarian law, and the failure of the High Contracting Parties to take
effective protective measures pursuant to their duties under the Fourth Geneva Convention,
have defeated Palestinian attempts to negotiate an agreement that would arrest and redress
the harm inflicted on our people. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now faced with an uprising of a civilian population against an
Occupying Power's unlawful and predatory abuses of its control over them and their
habitat. We are now also faced with the serious escalation of Israeli violations of human
rights and humanitarian law depicted in the human rights inquiry commission's report. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the eyes of our people we have engaged in an unreciprocated
seven-year cease fire in order to give political dialogue a chance. For the sake of our
two peoples' future, Israeli-Palestinian relations must be re-established on new and
sounder foundations based on reciprocated civility, and respect for human rights and the
rule of law. The unilateral prosecution of active hostilities by an occupying army against
defenseless civilian targets must cease. Our political dialogue must be salvaged and
restored. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we can hope to accomplish these challenging but crucial
objectives, Israel must quickly and decisively be made to respect the rules that must
govern its occupation. The discipline of respect for international human rights and
humanitarian law must be introduced into the peace process on its ground floor.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian civilian population must be helped to recover from
their aggravated recent trauma, and their confidence in the reliability of the protections
guaranteed in law must be restored. While vital areas of their lives, and their physical
security, remain under Israelís effective control, they must be feel secure that that
control will not be abused. They must be made secure from the threat of collective
penalties and acts of reprisal, including punitive closures. They must be made secure from
the indiscriminate, disproportionate and excessive use of force, including the use of
internationally-prohibited munitions. Their enjoyment of essential public services and
their public institutions must not be allowed to be subjected to threat and disruption by
financial strangulation or by punitive closures. They must be made secure from the
immediate and durable harm caused by Israelís establishment and expansion of its illegal
settlements. Respect for, and the unimpeded access of all believers to Christian and
Muslim religious sites must be ensured. Finally, the burden of self-protection against
grave breaches and gross violations of international humanitarian and human rights law
that has been improperly placed upon the Protected Persons themselves must be removed. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve the implementation of these basic protections, an
international monitoring force mandated to discharge the duties of the participating High
Contracting Parties pursuant to Article One of the Fourth Geneva Convention should be
deployed throughout the occupied Palestinian territories until Israel accepts the de jure
applicability of that Convention and establishes a satisfactory record of respect for its
provisions, or until we achieve a permanent peace. The implementation of these protections
will establish conditions under which the Palestinian National Authority will be able to
effectively maintain security and public order within the areas under its jurisdiction and
remove the practical obstacles and principled reservations that have arisen in respect of
its cooperation with Israel. Unfortunately, yet another opportunity was lost a few days
ago when the US used its veto to defeat another Security Council resolution meant to
chieve just that purpose, a balanced resolution calling upon the parties to implement
Sharm El Sheikh, resume negotiations on permanent settlement, and explore a mechanism to
provide international protection.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allow me, however, to emphasize the following features of the present
situation:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Settlement activities, which have accelerated since the beginning of
the Peace process, are a dynamic destructive factor, wherein there is no status quo, but a
constant aggravation of the terms of occupation. Settlements are both conceptual and
material obstacles to peace, while armed settlers, and armed settler-terrorism against
Palestinian civilians are the human instruments of this illegal aggression. Armed settlers
are not innocent civilians. Settlement activities, under the armed protection of the
mighty occupation forces, have been the major factor of incitement. Deepening the grip of
occupation of the land, settlements have constituted of hotbed of violence against
Palestinians, and the Israeli bulldozer has become the symbol of this continued
dispossession. The pursuit of settlement colonization and settler-violence have been the
sparkle that has kindled every eruption of popular anger. It is the main element that has
emptied of its content, deprived of its credibility and finally destroyed the
peace-process, and to put an end to settlement is one of the main objectives of the
present Intifada. This is true everywhere, in the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank and in
occupied East-Jerusalem. Settlement activities were stepped up in an unprecedented manner
under the government of Mr. Barak, and now Sharon has announced yet another settlement
drive, especially in occupied East-Jerusalem. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While recognizing the legitimacy of resistance to occupation, we firmly
and unambiguously condemn attacks against civilians and terrorism wherever it comes from.
But one must understand that the Israeli policy of bombing and shelling of neighborhoods,
political assassinations, repression and torture, and the multiform state of siege imposed
upon the whole of Palestinian society only fuel resentment, anger, despair and resistance.
One must also measure the growth of overt hate-talk and the unprecedented level of
unabated anti-Arab racist incitement which now dominates the Israeli media and political
discourse.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to seize this occasion to reassert in the most emphatic and
categoric fashion that the Palestinian leadership is still totally committed to the
strategic choice of Peace, and still totally committed to negotiating with the government
of Israel a permanent settlement of the conflict on the basis of international legality,
building upon the implementation of the agreements already signed and putting an end to
the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territory. I want to emphasize that we havnever
turned our back to negotiations, never indulged in the fatal illusion that one could
choose one&#146;s partner in peace or in war. We engaged in this peace process in Madrid
in 1991 with good faith and flexibility, with patience and hope. After eight years of
unkept promises, or commitments not implemented, of obligations violated, of clauses and
articles never materialized, our people is in the streets of our besieged country to
demand an end to the violence of occupation, an end to the violence of colonization, an
end to the violence of repression and aggression, an end to the denial of its most
elementary human rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Occupation is illegal. Settlements are illegal. But resistance to the
tyranny of an illegal foreign occupation is legal and legitimate. We condemn attacks
against civilians, children and other &#147;non-combatant populations&#148;, but we cannot
accept the supposedly &#147;balanced&#148; calls to &#147;both sides&#148; to put an end
to &#147;violence&#148;. We are determined to explore all possible avenues in order to
de-escalate the confrontation on the ground, and create conditions which will make it
possible to revive negotiations. But it must be very clear that it is the occupying power
who is in a position to set the de-escalation mechanism in motion. The government of
Israel is the only party which has the capacity to put an end to the spiral of
confrontation, terror and counter-terror. Not, as it seems now intent on doing, by
intensifying both its aggression on the ground and its campaign against the PNA in the
international arena, but by lifting the siege, freezing settlement activities and
returning to the table of negotiations. There is unfortunately no sign to that effect. And
so long as the Israeli government pursues its vain but murderous attempt to impose by
force the settlement it could not sell to the Palestinian negotiators, the issue of
Protection of Palestinian civilians will remain the central issue, the major challenge
facing the international community in general, and this august commission in particular.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Chairman,<br>
Dear colleagues<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">27 years ago, in New York, in a historical speech which remains as a
milestone in the relationship between the UN and the Palestinian people, President Arafat
called upon the world not to let the olive branch of Peace fall from his extended hand.
Unfortunately, this call is still relevant, in spite of the considerable progress and the
promising breakthrough of the Oslo years. The dramatic regression of the last six months,
from almost-peace to this semi-declared war, shows how fragile these incomplete
achievements were, how threatened what has been achieved. Your decisions here, today and
tomorrow, will weigh in a significant fashion upon the immediate future. Let us all work
together to draw an effective barrier, on the ground, to the ongoing escalation. The need
for international protection of the Palestinian people is the basic components of such a
dispositive. Let us not miss this opportunity to throw our weight in the balance.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you for your attention. </p>
