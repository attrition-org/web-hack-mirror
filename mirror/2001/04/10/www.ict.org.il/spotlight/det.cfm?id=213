<p><center><h2>Albanian Arrested in Connection with Security Threats</h2></center>
<p><p>An Albanian man was arrested in Tirana on suspicion of spying on American
diplomats. The suspect identified by the Albanian paper <i>Koha Jone</i>
as Maksim Ciciku, 34, was later released.
<p>Ciciku, educated in Saudi Arabia, works for a private security firm
supplying body guards to Arabs in Albania. He was suspected of shadowing
American embassy staff on behalf of a group affiliated with terrorist leader
Osama bin Ladin. Ciciku was allegedly detained by the Albanian secret police
on the basis of information supplied by the CIA.
<p>Ciciku was later released without being charged. He told a private television
station that police confiscated a weapon and communication equipment that
he used for his work.
<p>Last June four Egyptians were arrested in a crackdown on individuals
suspected of terrorist activities and deported to Egypt.&nbsp; The men
were suspected of links to Osama Bin Laden. A few weeks later, the Albanian
authorities arrested two more suspected employees bin Laden, and turned
over to the CIA a van load of documents and computer equipment related
to bin Ladin's organization.
<p>Soon after the bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
the embassy in Albania was shut down and most
<br>of its employees flown out of the country. The U.S. State Department
said that the closure was based on “a serious threat of a terrorist attack”
A travel warning was issued at the time warning Americans to avoid entering
Albania. This warning was renewed in December.
