<p><center><h2>Bomb Blast in South Africa  "Retaliation
against the U.S."</h2></center>
<p>
<P>A group calling itself </FONT>Muslims Against Global Oppression
has claimed responsibility for the bombing of a Planet Hollywood restaurant
in Cape Town, South Africa.&nbsp; The explosion ripped through the popular
American-franchised restaurant on Tuesday evening at 19:20 local time,
killing two people and injuring twenty-five. Reuters quoted Western Cape
police commissioner as saying, "It was an explosive device that was left
in the bar part of the cafe."

<P>Some time after the explosion a man claiming to represent Muslims Against
Global Oppression phoned a local radio correspondent, claiming that the
restaurant bomb was in in retaliation for U.S. missile strikes against
terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. The same group had protested
against President Clinton's visit to South Africa in March, calling him
"a killer" and burning a U.S. flag outside South Africa's parliament.

<P>Several radical Muslim groups are known to operate in Cape Town.&nbsp;
One of these, which calls itself&nbsp; People Against Gangsterism and Drugs
(PAGAD) has been involved in an escalating war against the gangs who run
the city's drug trade.&nbsp; They have reportedly set off a number of primitive
pipe bombs. Another group, the Kibla, routinely protests U.S. actions that
it sees as being against Islamic movements around the world.

<P>According to the Associated Press the group claiming to be behind the
attack was unknown to the U.S. State Department's counter-terrorism office
until it staged a demonstration outside the vacant Israeli diplomatic office
in Cape Town in July 1997.
