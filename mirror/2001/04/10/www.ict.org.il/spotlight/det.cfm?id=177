<p><center><h2>Suicide Bomber Narrowly Misses School Bus in Gaza</h2></center>
<p><P>A school bus carrying children was targeted by a suicide bomber this
morning in Gaza.  The bus, which was escorted before and aft by army
jeeps, was transporting children from the community of Kfar Darom to a
regional school near the Gush Katif Junction.

<P>A suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden vehicle attempted to collide head-on
with the bus.  The driver of the leading jeep moved to block the suspicious
car from reaching the bus, and the bomber detonated the explosives near
the jeep. At least one person in the jeep was killed, along with the suicide
bomber. Two passengers of the jeep were seriously injured. Six people sustained
light-to-moderate injuries, including three young people and three children.

<P><B>Soldiers' actions saved the schoolchildren</B>
<BR>OC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Yomtov Samiya was quoted by Israel Radio
as saying that the bomb consisted of several tens of kilograms of explosives.
He said that only the fact that the bus was armored saved the children,
and that the armor plating on the jeep probably prevented further casualties.
"We have already identified the owner of the car, and are investigating
the matter," he said. The suicide bomber was later identified by Palestinian sources as Mohammed Abdallah from Khan Younis. 

<P>A local resident interviewed on Israel Radio said, "all the windows
shook shortly after the children left for school. It was a great miracle
that the bus filled with children wasn't hit."

<P>IDF Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz praised the actions of the soldiers
in the convoy who intercepted the attacker. "The fact that they acted as
they did prevented a much greater catastrophe," he said.

<P><B>Hamas claim of responsibility questionable</B>
<BR>An anonymous caller to Israel Radio read a short statement in which
the Hamas movement claimed responsibility for the attack, saying "The attack
was meant to deter and frighten the settlers."

<P>However Reuven Paz, an expert on the Hamas movement at ICT said that
the statement appears suspicious and is not necessarily genuine. He said
the statement was signed with the slogan "Revolution Until Victory." This
is a slogan of the Fatah movement and has never been used by Hamas. Paz
noted that the <I>modus operandi </I>of the attack was reminiscent of the
bombings by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). In any case, he said,
the Hamas would be hard-pressed to carry out such an attack in Gaza as
opposed to the West Bank, due to the intensive activities of the Palestinian
Authority in Gaza against the organization.

<P>On October 27 Mahmoud Majdhoub, a senior commander of the Islamic Jihad
was wounded in a car bomb in Sidon.  The PIJ blamed Israel for the
attack and vowed revenge.

<P>This week marks the third anniversary of the assassination of Islamic
Jihad leader Fathi Shqaqi.  Shqaqi was killed by alleged Israeli agents
in Malta in 1995.  At a rally at the Ein al-Hilweh refugee camp near
Sidon last Sunday leaders of the organization vowed to avenge his death.
