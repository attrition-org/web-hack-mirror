<p><center><h2>PKK Pledges to Lay Down its Arms for Good</h2></center>
<p>
<p>The brother of imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan announced on
Wednesday that the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) was disarming for good.
"We are laying down our weapons, never to take them up again," PKK commander
Osman Ocalan said in a statement broadcast live by the pro-Kurdish satellite
channel Medya-TV. "We will never fight again."
<p>Osman Ocalan said that the PKK would henceforth continue its fight for
a Kurdish homeland through political means, rather than military ones.
Ocalan is a military commander in the PKK, and claimed to be speaking on
behalf of the organization's leadership council, of which he is a member.
<p><b>Possible backlash if Ocalan is executed</b>
<br>He noted that if a solution to the Kurdish problem is not found, "others
may again take up arms," but added that the PKK would do its best to prevent
this. However, he warned of a possible backlash should the death sentence
against PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan be carried out.
<p>Abdullah Ocalan, founder and chairman of the PKK was sentenced to death
for treason by a Turkish court in June. The death sentence is due to be
reviewed by the Turkish Court of Appeals in October, however the final
decision will be made by Turkey's parliament. If Abdullah Ocalan is hanged,
Osman warned, "we will not be able to control the situation."
<p><b>PKK continues to withdraw from Turkey</b>
<br>The PKK has begun pulling its forces out of Turkey, in response to
Abdullah Ocalan's call for a complete withdrawal. Osman Ocalan said that
the withdrawal had been slowed by continual pursuit by Turkish forces and
by the difficulties of the terrain, but that the withdrawal should be completed
by the end of the year. So far the organization has evacuated roughly a
fourth of it forces, he said.
<p>The PKK commander did not say where the PKK's forces would regroup,
but said that there was no lack of place for them to go. He suggested that
the withdrawal be monitored by the UN, saying that if the militants were
guaranteed safe-conduct the withdrawal would be completed sooner.
<p>Abdullah Ocalan first called for an end to the armed struggle and the
withdrawal of PKK forces in a statement issued from prison just over a
month ago. He urged his organization to end its 15-year uprising and called
for "a new phase of dialogue and conciliation." So far both Ocalan's calls
for dialogue and the PKK's unilateral cease-fire have been ignored by the
Turkish government.
