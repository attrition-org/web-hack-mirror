<p><center><h2>Arson Attack Kills 13 in Istanbul Department Store</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Unknown attackers set a crowded department store alight, killing at
least 13 people, in Turkey's deadliest terror attack in recent years. The
fire was apparently started by a firebomb attack on the ground floor of
the six-story building.
<p><b>Differing accounts</b>
<br>The exact chain of evens is still unclear. Istanbul fire chief Sabri
Yalin said that the attackers forced people up the stairs at gunpoint before
dousing the store with petrol and setting it ablaze. Others reported seeing
the attackers toss petrol bombs into the store from a vehicle in front
of the store. Still others said that three men walked into the store, threw
the bombs and escaped on foot.
<p>Within minutes of the attack the first few floors were engulfed in flames.
Eyewitnesses said that people ran for the stairs in search of escape.
<p>Istanbul governor, Erol Cakir said that more people might have been
saved if the first fire engines to arrive on the scene had been equipped
with extension ladders. One young woman was saved when people in a neighboring
building stretched a ladder across the intervening space, but others were
not so lucky.
<p>Thirteen people are reported dead so far, though the numbers are expected
to rise. Eleven died of smoke inhalation, while two people died in the
fire. Several others were severely injured when the leapt from the roof
of the building. The building had no fire-escape.
<p><b>Latest in a wave of violence</b>
<br>The attack was one of the worst in living memory in Istanbul. So far
no one has claimed responsibility, though suspicion immediately fell on
the PKK (Kurdistan Worker's Party).
<p>The attack was the fourth in a week in Istanbul, and
the latest in a series of firebombings, arson, and carbombings that have
swept across Turkey since the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. A
car bomb in the central Turkish town of Cankiri killed three last week
and seriously injured the regional governor. On Wednesday a suitcase
left in a taxi on a busy Istanbul street blew up, killing the driver
and wounding eight bystanders.
<p>Other bombs targeted buildings and vehicles in Turkey's
commercial center. One of these, a petrol bomb attack on a shopping center
killed one man. The <I>modus operandi</I> was similar to that of today's attack.
The earlier shopping center attack was claimed by a previously unknown
group calling itself the Kurdish Revenge Brigade. However, a Maoist group
called TIKKO also claimed responsibility for that attack and for the attempt
on the life of regional governor Ayhan Cevik in Cankiri.
<p><b>Is the PKK behind the TIKKO attacks?</b>
<br>TIKKO is known to have a strategic alliance with the
PKK. There has been increasing speculation in the Turkish press that the
recent attacks were sub-contracted out to TIKKO by the PKK as part
of a pact signed between the two organization last summer.
<p>The two groups have a commonality of interests, as well
as common supporters and a shared history. Although the ideological paths
of the two have diverged in recent years, they have nevertheless shared
weapons and tactics in the past. Both groups operated training camps in
Lebanon's Beka'a valley in the 1980's and often shared resources.
<p>The PKK may feel the need to carry out attacks at the
present time as revenge for the capture of its leader, now awaiting trial
on Imrali prison island. However the organization--determined to be seen
as a national liberation group--may be disinclined to claim responsibility
for such attacks. By allowing TIKKO to pull the trigger and to take the credit,
both groups get what they want--TIKKO gains publicity and prestige in the
eyes of its followers; the PKK gains a vicarious revenge while still being
more or less insulated from a political backlash.
