<p><center><h2>One Dead and More than Twenty Injured in Istanbul Bombing</h2></center>
<p>
A bomb explosion in a crowded Istanbul park killed one man and injured
more than 20 late Sunday night. The explosion occurred around 10:30 p.m.
at a park in the Avcilar quarter on the European side of the city. The
park overlooking the Sea of Marmara, is a popular picnic ground for Istanbul
residents.

<P><B>Spate of low-level bombings</B>
<BR>Police said that the homemade shrapnel bomb was hidden in a trash bin,
and may have been operated by a timer. According to local media, five or
six people were seen running from the park just before the explosion. Though
no one claimed responsibility for the blast, Istanbul governor Erol Cakir
said that he had no doubt that the PKK was behind the attack.

<P>According to Reuters, Turkish police sappers defused another bomb Saturday
night in the city's Beyoglu district, an entertainment and business area.&nbsp;
The bomb was connected to a timer and planted in a pedestrian area lined
by shops. A police officer quoted by Reuters said, "The bomb was of the
same type as the one which exploded in the park."

<P>Last week, a similar device exploded in a coffee house in Istanbul's
Gaziosmanpasha district, injuring three people. Police later arrested 10
people on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks to protest Ocalan's death
sentence. They were reportedly in possession of explosives when they were
apprehended.

<P><B>Conflicting signals</B>
<BR>Turkish authorities have urged vigilance in the wake of the latest
attacks. Security has been tightened in urban centers after the PKK threatened
to retaliate for the sentencing of Abdullah Ocalan. Intelligence reports
indicated that PKK operatives were already in place in Istanbul to carry
out attacks. Ocalan meanwhile called on his organization to refrain from
actions which might endanger his efforts to escape the death penalty handed
down by a Turkish court last week.

<P>Despite this, the PKK today officially claimed responsibility for last
week's machine gun attack on a coffee house in Elazig. Four people were
killed in the attack. In a statement reported by the German-based DEM news
agency that the attack was carried out by two fighters from the PKK's armed
wing, the Kurdistan People's Liberation Army (ARGK). However the statement
claimed that the attack targeted not a cafe, but a "training center of
the ultra-nationalists." The PKK's political wing, the ERNK, meanwhile
denied that any of the recent attacks were carried out by the PKK.

<P><B>Suicide bombings continue</B>
<BR>In yet another attack, a suicide bomber blew herself up in front of
the police headquarters in Adana. Fourteen people were wounded in the attack,
which occurred at roughly 4:20 in the afternoon. A possible accomplice
to the bomber is being sought by police. Suicide bombings, usually against
army and police checkpoints are a favorite <I>modus operandi </I>of the
PKK.
