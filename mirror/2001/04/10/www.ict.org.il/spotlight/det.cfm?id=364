<p><center><h2>U.S. State Department Issues Worldwide Travel Warning</h2></center>
<p>The United States has warned its citizens traveling abroad that terrorists
could be seeking to target Americans. The <a href="http://travel.state.gov/wwc_terrorist.html" target="_new">travel
warning</a> cited "credible evidence that terrorists are planning attacks
specifically targeting American citizens" over the New Year, which this
year coincides with the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
<p><b>Warning linked to Osama bin Ladin</b>
<br>The warning urged U.S. citizens traveling abroad to "avoid large crowds
and gatherings, keep a low profile, and vary routes and times of all required
travel." The travel warning did not single out a particular region, but
emphasized the global nature of the threat.
<p>The travel warning was intended to supplement previous warnings involving
Osama bin Ladin's organization "al-Qaida." The warning was reportedly prompted
by the arrest of a number of individuals who were said to be plotting terrorist
attacks against Americans. Several of those arrested had definite links
to bin Ladin's organization, and were said to be planning to target Christian
targets in Jerusalem or Rome over the New Year holiday. The arrest took
place in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, according to U.S. officials.
<p>In Pakistan, a man called Abu Ayed was arrested on suspicion of having
close ties with bin Ladin. Abu Ayed, a Jordanian who held a US passport was arrested in Hayatabad. Bin Ladin
operatives have recently been arrested in Turkey as well.
<p><b>Opportunities for terrorism</b>
<br>The U.S. State Department has issued similar warnings in the past concerning
the possibility of terrorist activity during Ramadan. The threat is increased
considerably by the fact that Ramadan coincides with the Millennium celebrations,
which will draw large crowds all around the world.
<p>The Millennium could also see a variety of Y2K-related problems, which
terrorists could conceivably take advantage of to launch attacks. Earlier
this month the FBI arrested two men in California who had planned to bomb
a propane storage facility.
<p>According to the FBI, the suspects were members of a militia group seeking
to overthrow the federal government. They reportedly hoped that the bombing
would goad the government into declaring martial law, thus giving the militias
a chance to act against the government.
<p>Meanwhile security forces in Israel are on the alert for apocalyptic
cults, which may be planning violence against Jewish and Muslim Holy places
in Jerusalem. Members of several potentially violent religious groups have
already been deported from Israel, Greece and several European countries.
