<p><center><h2>Update: Investigation into the Bombing of USS Cole</h2></center>
<p><P>Over 160 investigators from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the U.S. State Department are hard at work attempting to piece together
the sequence of events that preceded the bombing of the American Destroyer
USS Cole. Security sources in Washington say that the evidence increasingly
points to a sophisticated and well-financed terrorist operation.

<P><B>A well-planned attack</B>
<BR>From what is now known of the attack, the explosion that cost the lives
of 17 U.S. sailors originated in a small fiberglass or inflatable boat
some seven meters in length. Witnesses said the boat was manned by two
people, who stood at attention just before the explosives detonated.

<P>The blast blew a hole over 12 meters in diameter in the steel-plate hull of
the Destroyer. Experts say the damage indicated that the explosion was
equal in power to some 440 pounds of TNT. According to ABC News, FBI investigators
pointed to the fact that the walls of the blast hole were turned inward
as evidence of a possible shaped charge.

<P>Whatever the exact composition of the explosives used, the operation
itself would have required a sophisticated level of operational planning.
The Yemeni authorities had received advance notice of the stopover less
than two weeks prior to the docking. The bombers would thus have needed
to plan their attack on short notice and be in a position to infiltrate
the harbor at the appropriate time.

<P>All of this points to a high level of surveillance of U.S. Naval activity
and knowledge of refueling and security procedures. However, even more
ominous, the entire operation would very likely require the help of local
harbor workers, and perhaps even government employees.

<P>U.S. Naval authorities pointed out that all services for the refueling
stop are provided by local vendors, including fuel and harbor services.
Without the interception of electronic communications, it would be impossible
for the bombers to have known in advance of the time of arrival and scheduling
of the USS Cole. This has raised suspicions that the perpetrators either
planted or bought collaborators in one or more of the local vendors or
the harbor authority. They could have even been tipped off by sympathetic
sources in the Yemeni military or government.
<BR> 
<BR><B>Claims of responsibility</B>
<BR>So far two groups have claimed credit for the bombing of the USS Cole. The leader
of the London-based Al-Muhajiroun militant group, Mohammed Bakri, said last
Friday that he was contacted by a group known as Muhammed's Army. The group
claimed to have carried out the attack but offered no corroborating details.
Bakri, who claims to be a spokesman for Osama bin Ladin, was dismissive
of the claim.

<P>Somewhat more plausible is the claim of an offshoot of the Aden-Abyan
Islamic Army, which according to <I>Al-Hayyat</I> was made through the
group's London contact Abu Hamza al-Masri. This violently anti-American and
anti-Western group was founded with the help of bin Ladin's brother and
is led by veterans of the Afghan war. In December 1998 the Aden-Abyan
Islamic Army kidnapped 16 Western tourists in southern Yemen; four of the
tourists died in a rescue attempt by the Yemeni government. The group's
leader, Zein al-Abidine al-Mehdar, was executed last year for his part in
the kidnapping.

<P>The Islamic Army has loose ties to bin Ladin, and has made his cause
its own. The group has demanded an end to the U.S. military presence
in Yemen and at the Muslim holy sites. However, the attack on the Cole
would have required a level of sophistication far in excess of what has
so far been displayed by the Islamic Army.

<P>In addition, the group has been hard-pressed by the Yemeni security
forces and has suffered a number of setbacks. It has a history of bogus
or exaggerated claims of responsibility.

<P>A number of other Islamist extremist groups have a presence in Yemen,
among them Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. While there is some
speculation that these groups could have carried out the attack in response
to a perceived American support of Israel, neither of these groups has
targeted American interests in the past, nor threatened to do so.

<P>On the other hand, several other radical Islamic groups have made such
threats, and could conceivably have been in a position to carry them out.
The Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the al-Gama'at Islamiyyah both have a strong
presence in Yemen. Both groups support Osama bin Ladin's al-Qaidah network.
Al-Qaidah maintains businesses and training camps in Yemen.

<P>There is also the possibility that the attack was carried out by a local
group, such as the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, but with the help of another
country. The finger of suspicion in such a case would most naturally point
to Iraq. The USS Cole was on its way to the Persian Gulf to enforce the
naval embargo on Iraq when it was targeted. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has been increasingly vocal in his threats against the United States, Israel,
and the moderate Arab states.

<P><B>The bin Ladin connection</B>
<BR>However, the name that pops up again and again with respect to the
bombing of the Cole is that of Osama bin Ladin. Whether the attack was
carried out by local people or not, most experts expect to find that
bin Ladin was somehow involved.

<P>The United States is apparently taking very seriously the possibility
of a bin Ladin connection. ABC News reported on 15 October that the investigation
into the bombing had been handed over to U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who
handles all cases related to the bin Ladin and his al-Qaidah network.

<P>Bin Ladin is known to have set up training camps and recruiting stations
in Yemen, the original home of his family. He took credit for the bombing of
a hotel hosting American troops in 1992, which he said drove U.S. troops
out of Yemen; and of course, he makes no secret of his hatred for all things
American. Only last month al-Jezera satellite TV broadcast a video in
which bin Ladin vowed to "take action against this iniquitous and faithless
force which has spread troops throughout Egypt, Yemen and Saudi Arabia."

<P>The reference to Yemen may not have been coincidental. Bin Ladin has
good contacts in the country, including Sheikh Abdel Majid Zindani, an
associate from the Afghan war, now the ideological leader of Yemen's main
opposition party, Islah.

<P>Vincent Cannistraro, former chief of the CIA's counter-terrorist department,
pointed out that the attack was most certainly an "inside job," which would
seem to indicate local support. The Washington Post quoted Cannistraro
as saying that "specific information" indicated that a bin Laden cell was
"operationalized" last week, but that it was unclear whether the USS Cole
was its target.

<P>If the U.S. is seriously regarding Osama bin Ladin as a suspect, he
seems quite happy to take the blame. In a statement published in Pakistan's
largest circulation Urdu-language newspaper, <I>The Jang, </I>on 17 October,
bin Ladin warned the United States against attacking Afghanistan in retaliation
for the attack. Without directly mentioning the attack on the Cole, he
vowed to continue his battle against the "enemies of Islam."
