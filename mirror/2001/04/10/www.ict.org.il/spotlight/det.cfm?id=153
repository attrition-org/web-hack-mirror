<p><center><h2>Two More U.S Embassies shut in Africa</h2></center>
<p>

<P>The United States has temporarily closed two more embassies in Africa,
following unspecified threats.

<P>A U.S. State Department <A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/ghana_announce.html" target="_new">Public
Announcement</A> noted stated that the embassy in Ghana would be closed
from August 31 through September 2, and perhaps longer, due to "an increased
threat to U.S. government installations in Ghana."&nbsp; American citizens
in Ghana were warned to "avoid all U.S. facilities on these days."

<P>A similar announcement was posted concerning the U.S. embassy in neighboring
Togo, where the facility was said to be closed due to a "security alert"
pertaining to August 31 and possibly additional days.

<P>This brings to five the total number of U.S. embassies in Africa closed down
because of security threats.&nbsp; The others are in Khartoum, Sudan; Bissau,
Guinea-Bissau; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; Brazzaville, Republic
of Congo; and Mogadishu, Somalia.&nbsp; Several of the embassies ceased
operation soon after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
others have closed down since the American retaliatory strikes in Afghanistan
and Sudan.

<P>A variety of threats have forced U.S. security authorities to tighten
security at American facilities around the world.&nbsp; Reportedly, operatives
affiliated with Osama bin Ladin's network have offered monetary incentives to
other terrorist organizations to attack American interests.
