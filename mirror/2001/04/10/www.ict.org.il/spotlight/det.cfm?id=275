<p><center><h2>Egyptian Militant Indicted in United States</h2></center>
<p>
<p>The leader of the terrorist cell that assassinated Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat has been charged in connection with the bombing of the American
embassies in East Africa in August '98.
<p><b>Egyptian al-Jihad leader shares bin Ladin's spotlight</b>
<br>Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the Egyptian al-Jihad group is believed
to be in hiding with bin Ladin in Afghanistan. He allegedly sat on the
al-Qaidah ruling council, which planned the embassy attacks. In addition
al-Zawahiri was among those who endorsed bin Ladin's <a href="../articles/fatwah.htm"><i>fatwah</i></a> against
American citizens. The <i>fatwah</i> urges Muslims to kill Americans, including
civilians, anywhere they are found.
<p>Al-Zawahiri--who since 1992 has led a bloody fight to set up Islamic
rule in Egypt--brought his group into bin Ladin's network in order&nbsp;
to oppose non-Islamic governments with terrorism. His group claimed responsibility
for the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat. Al-Zawahiri already faces the
death penalty in Egypt and was among those tried <i>in absentia </i>by
an Egyptian military court this past April.
<p>Only three days before the embassy bombings, Al-Zawahiri threatened
to retaliate against America for its capture and extradition of al-Jihad
members from Albania to Egypt.
<p><b>The "Nuclear Bomb of Islam"</b>
<br>According to the indictment, al-Zawahiri also worked with bin Ladin
to obtain "The Nuclear Bomb of Islam." In May of 1998 bin Ladin issued
a statement saying, "it is the duty of the Muslims to prepare as much force
as possible to terrorize the enemies of God."
<p>The U.S. attorney's revised 267-count indictment regarding the embassy bombings
adds 29 new counts to the previous indictment. This is the sixth revision
of the proceedings. <p>The latest version of
the indictment added two new names to the list of accused, thus bringing
the total number of defendants to 15, including bin Ladin. Five defendants indicted in the case are in custody in the United States.
These include Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, Ali Mohammad, Wadih el-Hage, Mohammed
Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali. A date for the trial of
the defendants in custody has not yet to be set.  Nine of the
accused are still at large.
<p><b>The al-Qaidah "media" office</b>
<br>The second name on the revised indictment is that of Khaled al-Fawwaz.
He is suspected of setting up businesses in Nairobi to provide operational
cover for the bombing. al-Fawwaz is currently in custody in Britain. A
hearing is scheduled for June 24 in London to consider al-Fawwaz' extradition
to the United States.
<p>The indictment described al-Fawwaz as responsible for al-Qaidah's "media
department," which sent messages from terrorist leaders to the media. He is said to have set up a media information office in London in 1994 to publicize
bin Ladin's statements, recruit others, and obtain satellite telephones
and equipment to improve communications among terrorists.
<p>Among the documents disseminated by his office was bin Ladin's August
1996 declaration against Americans, which called for Muslims to "expel
the heretics from the Arabian Peninsula." The indictment said that in the
hours before and after the U.S. embassy bombings on August 7 claims of
responsibility for the bombings were sent to and from al-Fawwaz's London
office.
