and Sudan</h2></center>

<P><I>The United States has launched attacks on sites in Afghanistan and
a factory in Sudan, linked to Osama bin Ladin,&nbsp; suspected as being
behind the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania.</I>

<P>The United States has launched attacks on six sites in Afghanistan and
a factory in Sudan.&nbsp; The sites are linked to Osama bin Ladin's international
terror network. Bin Ladin has been suspected from the very beginning as
being behind the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania.
The Sudan target was a chemical weapons facility in northern Khartoum,
which, according to Israeli security analysts, quoted by Israel radio was
built with Iraqi support.

<P>In a public announcement, U.S. President Bill Clinton said, "We have
convincing evidence these groups played the key role in the embassy bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania . . .Terrorists must have no doubt that in the face
of their threat, America will protect its citizens . . . Today we have
struck back."

<P><B>"Declaration of war"</B>
<BR>A group calling itself&nbsp; the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders (<I>Al-Jabhah al-Islamiyyah al-`Alamiyyah li-Qital al-Yahud
wal-Salibiyyin</I>) issued a warning earlier this week that “strikes will
continue from everywhere” against American targets, both military and civilian.
This is the same group founded by bin Ladin in February 1998. The group
published a fatwah, or Muslim religious ruling calling Muslims the world
over to attack American interests.&nbsp; An American security analyst was
quoted by Israel radio last month as saying that the U.S. regarded such
rulings as, "a declaration of war."

<P>CNN quoted an unnamed security source in Washington as saying that the
confession of Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, the prime suspect in the embassy bombings,
was a major intelligence break.&nbsp; Odeh's testimony provided a detailed
description of bin Ladin's involvement in a number of anti-American terrorist
attacks.&nbsp; The investigation involved cooperation between the intelligence
agencies of a number of countries, pointed with "near certainty to bin
Ladin's hand in these incidents."

<P>The targets were known bases and training camps belonging to Osama bin
Ladin. Though there have as yet been no reports of casualties, the bases
were reported to be densely populated and well-guarded at all times.&nbsp;
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, seemed to corroborate this,&nbsp;
saying "We have taken these actions to reduce the ability of these terrorist
organizations to train and equip their misguided followers."

<P>Clinton, in a hastily called press conference, pointed out the reasons
for the U.S. attack:
<UL>
<LI>
"These groups have executed terrorist attacks against Americans in the
past."</LI>

<LI>
"We have compelling information that they were planning additional terrorist
attacks against our citizens and others."</LI>

<LI>
"They are seeking to acquire chemical weapons and other dangerous weapons."</LI>
</UL>
<B>Foreign workers out from Afghanistan and Pakistan</B>
<BR>International aid agencies began pulling their staff out of Afghanistan
yesterday, following a warning from the U.S. State Department that non-Muslim
workers could be in danger.&nbsp; Although the U.S was not specific about
the danger, there was speculation that the warning was related to the presence
in Afghanistan of Osama bin Ladin. It was common knowledge that the exiled
Saudi millionaire is suspected of masterminding the terrorist bombings
of American embassies in east Africa. There were hints as well that the
warning was related to the arrest last week of a follower of bin Ladin
in Pakistan. His testimony linked bin Ladin to a number of previous attacks
on American targets.

<P>The State Department began pulling its people out of Pakistan with unprecedented
urgency several days ago, sparking local rumours that the U.S. was preparing
to "go after" bin Ladin.

<P>The U.S. has emphasised that the Taliban cannot expect recognition,
as the legitimate government of Afghanistan unless it extradites Osama
bin Ladin. A spokesman for the movement, which now controls most of Pakistan,
has ruled out the possibility of handing over bin Ladin to the U.S. Government.

<P><B>Results of the American strikes</B>
<BR>The Taliban has issued a formal statement claiming that Osama bin Ladin
is "alive and well" after the American attacks.&nbsp; The group claimed
that the U.S. attacks were concentrated on the mountains of Kost and the
area of Jalalabad, but that bin Ladin had moved to a well-protected area
prior attack.

<P>The Sudanese government claims that "U.S. warplanes attacked a private
factory for pharmaceuticals in Khartoum."&nbsp; Sudanese radio reports
said that at about 20:00 local time, three large explosions were heard
in the direction of the "Shifa" pharmaceuticals plant, after which missiles
were fired.&nbsp; The large, three-story facility is said to have been
heavily damaged in the attack.&nbsp; There were initial reports of casualties.&nbsp;
Electricity outages were reported in several sections of the city.

<P>The attacks were reportedly executed by means of 'Tomahawk" guided missiles
lauched from American ships. U.S. Secretary of State, William Cohen has
stated that more attacks may follow.
