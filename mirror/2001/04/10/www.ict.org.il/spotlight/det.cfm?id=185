<p><center><h2>Taliban Cautions U.S. Regarding bin Ladin Indictment</h2></center>
<p>
<P>The Afghan Taliban militia has issued a statement to the effect that
the United States could endanger its citizens by attempting to prosecute
Osama bin Laden. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicted bin Ladin and his
top military commander, Mohammed Atef on 224 counts of conspiracy to commit
murder on the background of the August bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.

<P><B>The Indictment covers over a decade of terrorist activity</B>
<BR>Also named in the indictment were four of bin Ladin's operatives--Wadih
El Hage, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, Mohamed Sadik Odeh and Mohamed Rasheed
Daoud Al-'Owhali.&nbsp; In addition to the embassy bombings, the indictment
accuses bin Ladin of a long list of terrorist activities. Among these are:
<UL>
<LI>
The October 1993 attack in Mogadishu, Somalia, that&nbsp; killed 18 U.S.
soldiers,&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Cooperation and joint activities with terrorist groups such as Al-Gama'a
al-Islamiyya (The Islamic Group), Hizballah, and the Egyptian al-Jihad.</LI>

<LI>
Assistance to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in weapons development.</LI>

<LI>
Cooperation with representatives of the government of Iran in planning
operations against the United States.</LI>

<LI>
Planning and/or executing a wide range of terrorist attacks against American
citizens and the citizens of other nations,</LI>

<LI>
Attempting to obtain the components of chemical and nuclear weapons.</LI>
</UL>
The Taliban, in an official statement read over the its official radio,
warned that the U.S. Supreme Court's indictment could set off a
violent popular response: "all that the Americans will gain is a storm of hatred
against them--in this region, and in the whole Muslim world.  It will cost them
hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of years to find any friends
here."

<P><B>Five million dollar reward may find no takers</B>
<BR>U.S. officials have offered a $5 million reward for information leading
to capture of either Osama bin Ladin or Mohammed Atef. Some have questioned the effectiveness
of offering a monetary reward for someone who is regarded as a hero by
just about anyone likely to have any concrete knowledge of his doings.

<P>In any case, extricating bin Laden from his fortress in the remote Afghan mountains
would be no easy task. The terrain, the close-knit structure of his organization,
and the esteem in which he is held by his compatriots, all make a covert
mission to capture him extremely risky and unlikely to succeed.&nbsp; Barring
the consent of the Taliban in extraditing bin Ladin, nothing short of a
major military operation would stand much chance of bringing him to trial.&nbsp;
The Taliban has already stated that it will not hand him over.

<P><B>The Taliban sets deadline for evidence against bin Ladin</B>
<BR>The most the Taliban is willing to do is try bin Ladin under Islamic
law in Afghanistan if provided with evidence of his involvement in terrorist
activities. Several weeks ago a judicial inquiry was set up by the militia
to investigate the allegations against him. According to Taliban spokesman
Abdul Hai Muttmayan, "If anyone has any evidence of bin Ladin's involvement
in cases of terrorism, subversion, sabotage or any other acts they should
present it to the court before November 20. If by then there is nothing,
we will close the case and in our eyes he will be acquitted."

<P>The United States has dismissed the Taliban's ultimatum. "We
believe that Osama bin Ladin should be brought to justice swiftly for his
crimes," U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said, adding, "there
is no expiration date on terrorist acts of this kind." Rubin said that
the United States is discussing the bin Ladin issue with the Taliban. However,
he ruled out the possibility of a formal extradition request, because the
U.S. does not recognize the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan.

<P><B>A diplomatic dilemma</B>
<BR>Non-recognition of the Taliban puts the U.S. in a dilemma. While recognition
of the Taliban would mean legitimization of the militia's takeover of Afghanistan,
such recognition would give the United States more leverage in dealing
with the movement. Not only could the U.S. request the extradition of bin
Ladin, but in the event of a refusal to comply, it could lobby for the
imposition of UN sactions--such as those levied against Libya for its refusal
to surrender the Lockerbie bombing suspects.


<P><B>Indictment "sends a message"</B>
<BR>Regardless of the improbability of bringing bin Ladin to justice, American
officials see the indictment as a milestone--it's importance is as much
symbolic as anything else. In the words of Attorney General Janet Reno,
"This is an important step forward in our fight against terrorism. It sends
a message that no terrorist can flout our laws and murder innocent civilians."
