<p><center><h2>Osama bin Ladin and the Nairobi Bombing</h2></center>
<p>

<P>The investigation underway in Nairobi has not only confirmed the role
of Osama bin Ladin in the bombing of the American embassy there, but is
revealing many new details on how bin Ladin's
network actually works. The Kenyan daily <I>Nation</I> reported the details
as they emerged from the investigation into the bombing.

<P>Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, Khalid Salim, and Abdallah Nacha&nbsp; were members
of a seven-man team sent to Nairobi by Osama bin Ladin's network to "strike
a blow against the Crusaders and the Jews."

<P><B>Planning and reconnaissance</B>
<BR>According to a source quoted in the Nation, planning for the bombing
was finalized in July under the leadership of Ali Saleh, a member of the
Egyptian <A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18">al-Jihad</A> group.&nbsp;
Saleh is said to be an associate of Osama bin Ladin, and the leader of
bin Ladin's network in Africa.

<P>However, the operatives who were to carry out the attack were in place
in Kenya long before.&nbsp; Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, whose marriage to a Kenyan
women allegedly made him a good choice for the mission set up the group's
cover.&nbsp; He worked as a fisherman in Mombasa and&nbsp; traveled regularly
to Nairobi to sell his catch. Khalid and Abdallah, based in Nairobi "bought"
and sold Mohammed's fish&nbsp; to restaurants and hotels. In this way they
were able to familiarize themselves with the city, and with the area around
the American embassy.

<P>Having familiarized themselves with the area, they sketched out the
entry and escape routes. According to <I>the Nation</I>, the three men
now in custody are the same three who were seen filming the embassy with
video recorders on August 4, only three days prior to the bombings.&nbsp;
They were spotted by a witness, described by the paper as an "experienced
security officer." He reported the matter to the U.S. marine guards at
the embassy, only to be told that the filmers were most likely tourists.

<P><B>Execution of the attack</B>
<BR>The primary components of the bomb would have needed to be assembled
near to the place where it was to be detonated, in order to minimize risks
of accidents enroute.&nbsp; This task was reportedly carried out by four
men who rented rooms 102 and 107 of the Hilltop hotel in Nairobi.&nbsp;
The men, described by the Nation as two Palestinians, an Egyptian and a
Saudi Arabian, were said to have bought a drum of aqueous ammonia solution
from a school and laboratory shop near the hotel.&nbsp; Odeh, who may have
been the leader of the group, is said to have assembled parts of the bomb
and gave technical advice to the other terrorists on how to detonate the
device.

<P>The original intention of the terrorists was apparently to detonate
the bomb directly beneath the American embassy, where they were certain
to cause massive devastation. One of the men was quoted by the paper as
saying that&nbsp; "the bomb was highly explosive and if they had managed
to sneak it into the basement, it would have brought down the targeted
embassy building and all the adjacent ones."

<P>From the layout of the embassy building and its surroundings it is probably
true that the attack might have caused even more damage than it did had
it been carried out as planned.&nbsp; What prevented this from happening
was the fact that the guards near the rear gate of the embassy challenged
the terrorists and would not let them pass.&nbsp; Apparently the terrorists
detonated the bomb prematurely, while engaging the embassy guards in an
exchange of gunfire.

<P>Khalid Salim has been identified in a police lineup as the man who jumped
from the back of the pick-up and threw a grenade at the guards. Salim was
lightly injured but escaped the main force of the blast, as did the guard
who later identified him.&nbsp; The guard said that he had ducked the grenade
and then run around the side of the building yelling "terrorism! terrorism!"&nbsp;
Moments later, the bomb exploded. Reportedly two of the bombers died in
the blast.&nbsp; It is not clear whether they were intended to be suicide
bombers or whether the premature detonation of the bomb caught them in
the truck before they could escape.

<P><B>Loose ends</B>
<BR>After the bombings the surviving perpetrators were to have dispersed
and made their way separately back to Afghanistan, where they were to be
"greeted and congratulated by Osama bin Ladin."&nbsp; It is unclear, how
many did indeed succeed in escaping.&nbsp; At least two were apparently
killed in the blast. Odeh told Pakistani interrogators that six other conspirators
left Kenya before the explosion, arriving in Pakistan on different flights
between Aug. 5 and Aug. 7.&nbsp; He himself left Kenya only hours ahead
of the attack, at was arrested upon arrival in Pakistan and turned over
to Kenya. Khalid Salim, and Abdallah Nacha are in custody in Nairobi.&nbsp;
Two additional suspects--a Saudi and a Sudanes--were reportedly being held
in Karachi.&nbsp; However, it has not yet been established if these two
are connected with the bombing or not. The <I>New York Times</I> reported
that the suspects detained by Pakistani authorities are suspected of arranging
safe passage for Odeh and his colleagues through Pakistan to Afghanistan.

<P>It is also unclear how much local help the terrorists had. The FBI recently
raided the offices of a Saudi welfare organization suspected of being a
front for bin Ladin's activities. On August 22, the FBI carried out an
extensive search in a private house in the Maweni area.&nbsp; Local people
said that the place had recently been visited from "strangers from Witu,"
which suggests that the place may have been used as a safe house prior
to the bombings.

<P><B>The legacy of the mujahedin</B>
<BR>Mohammed Odeh would seem to be typical of the men working for bin Ladin's
networks.&nbsp; According to <I>the Nation</I>, he is the son of Palestinian
parents, born in Tabuk in Saudi Arabia in March, 1965. He joined the Palestinian
Liberation Organization while studying in Jordan. He acquired a diploma
in architecture from the Philippines.

<P>In 1990 Odeh, traveled to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban's
mujahedin against a communist government. There he met Osama bin Ladin,
a legendary figure among the Arabs who had come to join the struggle. After
the fall of Afghanistan's communist government in 1992, Odeh said bin Laden
sent him to Kenya in 1994 to attack U.S. interests in Africa. Odeh told
Pakistani investigators that he was involved in killing of two Belgian
members of the UN peace-keeping force in Somalia. He claimed that he and
a group of guerrillas remained in Somalia aiding clan leader Mohammed Farah
Aideed for a full year, and "considered the humiliation of U.S. troops there a major
victory."
