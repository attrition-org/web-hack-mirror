<p><center><h2>Palestinian Islamic Jihad Claims Bombing</h2></center>
<p>
<P>The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has claimed responsibility for last
Friday's bombing in Jerusalem. A leaflet faxed to Reuters news agency in
Jerusalem said, "This heroic attack, which was not the first and will not
be the last, was carried out . . . to confront the great conspiracy that
aims to liquidate the Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation
agreements."

<P><IMG SRC="../graphics/car_bomb1.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=131 WIDTH=175 ALIGN=RIGHT>In
an interview with Radio Monte Carlo's Arabic Service, Islamic Jihad leader
Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, currently residing in Damascus, confirmed the
reports that the PIJ was behind the bombing.&nbsp; Israeli reports soon
after the bombing had identified the terrorists as members of the PIJ,
discounting reports that Hamas was responsible.

<P>The two terrorists killed in the explosion were identified by the Islamic
Jihad as Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 22, of the Anata refugee camp north
of Jerusalem, and Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, of the village of Silat al-Hartiyeh,
north of Jenin. Both men had previously served prison sentences in Israel
for security-related offenses.

<P><B>"It could have been much worse"</B>
<BR>It isn't clear what type of attack the two were attempting, though
Israeli sources are in agreement that the Mahane Yehuda market was the
intended target. From the remains of suitcases found in the wreck of the
car it would seem that the plan was to carry out two separate suicide bombings.&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../graphics/car_bomb2.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=167 WIDTH=213 ALIGN=LEFT>Possibly
the car was to have been detonated by one of the men, while the other was
to have carried an explosives-laden suitcase deeper into the crowded market.

<P>This plan apparently misfired when the mechanism for detonating the
explosives malfunctioned or detonated prematurely. Security sources said
the bombs were of a "very low professional level, almost primitive." The
series of small explosions alerted bystanders that something was wrong.
Most of the people in the area managed to get out of range of the main
explosion in time, averting a major tragedy. As it was, 21 people were
injured, most lightly, and several moderately to seriously. The phrase
on everyone's lips was, "it could have been much worse."

<P><B>Palestinian Authority arrests Jihad members</B>
<BR>Israeli security services are currently searching for a senior Islamic
Jihad official in the Jenin area who is suspected of involvement in the
attack, after both Israeli and Palestinian investigators concluded that
orders for the attack came from the Jenine branch of Islamic Jihad. The
town is under the control of the Palestinian Authority, though both men
lived in villages under Israeli security control.

<P>The Palestinian security authorities arrested five Islamic Jihad activists
in Jenin and three in the Bethlehem area, while the Israeli security forces
arrested seven men from the village of Silat al-Kharithiya, where one of
the terrorists lived. Suleiman Musa Dahayneh was on Israel's wanted list.
He was arrested by the Palestinian Authority, only to be released a short
time later over Israeli protests.

<P>The Islamic Jihad has not carried out a major bombing since its leader
Fathi Shqaqi was shot dead in Malta by two men on a motorcycle in October
1995. Most of the group's activities since then have been on the political
front. The group's main affiliation is with Iran, from which it receives
both logistics support and instruction.

<P>According to Israeli security sources, the organization does not have
a sophisticated infrastructure in the territories, and both the quantity
and quality of its activists are inferior to those of Hamas. Ya'akov Perry,
former head of the General Security Service, said that raids conducted
by Israeli security forces and, more recently, by PA security forces have
led to the arrest of key leaders and the killing of expert bomb makers.
"There is a weakness both in the explosives used and in the engineers--the
experts capable of building bombs--and there is also a problem in the quality
of the terrorists themselves."

<P><B>Reactions to Friday's attack</B>
<BR>Although the Israeli cabinet suspended its discussion on the Wye accords
upon hearing of the attack it isn't likely that the attack will cause a
major delay in the implementation of the agreement. Israeli Defense Minister,
Yitzhak Mordehai said that the agreement will probably be ratified during
the coming week. "I&nbsp; estimate that the government will meet this week
and will accept&nbsp; the decision of the majority." Ironically, the attack
may have occurred just in time to prove a point. For while the terrorists
were both from locations under the control of Israel's security forces,
they received their orders and training from areas under the control of
the Palestinian Authority. The fact that both Israeli and Palestinian activity
would have been needed to preempt the attack has been widely commented
on in Israeli political circles.

<P>The United States President Bill Clinton condemned the attack as an
act of "criminal terror," and said that the only answer to such an act
would be to persevere in the quest for peace. Palestinian leaders said
Israel should not use Friday's suicide bombing as an excuse to stop the
peace process.

<P>On Friday evening the Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee
approved a letter from Arafat to Clinton specifying which clauses of the
PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction were null and void. This was
a first step toward meeting the Israeli demand that all clauses calling
for the destruction of Israel be deleted from the charter. However several
leaders of radical Palestinian groups announced on Sunday in Damascus that
they would attempt to block any effort to amend the Palestinian National
Charter to remove the clauses. They accused Arafat of "selling out" to
the Israelis and the Americans.

<P>Although most European leaders refrained from condemning the bombing,
Pope John Paul II, in his weekly appearance, said, "Another attack in the
center of Jerusalem has awakened new fears for peace just when hopes were
reborn ... after the recent&nbsp; accord between both sides that was the
fruit of arduous and&nbsp; courageous negotiating."
