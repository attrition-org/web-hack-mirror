<P>According to the terms of the Mideast peace agreement signed at Wye
Plantation, the CIA is destined to play an unusually public role as arbitrator
between the security forces of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

<P>We should bear in mind that the CIA was involved in intelligence activities
in the region long before the Oslo accords and this involvement deepened
still more after they were signed. Usually the CIA's activities were not
public knowledge until relatively recently. For example, the CIA trained
some members of the intelligence forces of the Palestinian Authority. In
March 96, after the severe suicide attacks in Israel George Tenet, who
was then deputy director of the CIA, met with Arafat. At the same time
discussions took place between representatives of Israeli, American and
Arab intelligence agencies at Sharm e-Sheikh. They even decided on the
establishment of a joint coordination apparatus. In March 97, after the
terror attack at the Apropo Cafe in Tel-Aviv, representatives of the CIA
met with security authorities from Gaza. And in August 97, after the terror
attack in Jerusalem, and the discovery of the Hamas explosives factory
at Bet Sahour, the IDF performed a laboratory experiment that revealed
the Hamas involvement in the attack. This experiment was witnessed by both
Palestinian and CIA intelligence officials.

<P><B>Old business in a new suit</B>
<BR>The Wye Plantation Agreement would seem to lead naturally to a deepening
of the CIA's role in keeping the peace. From what has been published about
the security agreement it seems that the U.S. is helping to develop the
Palestinian counter-terrorist strategy. In future the CIA will meet as
part of a joint committee every two weeks with the Palestinian Authority
to examine what steps the PA has taken to destroy the infrastructure of
terrorism. The committee will check whether the PA has outlawed the terrorist
organizations and what punitive steps have been taken against those accused
of violent acts, and the confiscation of illegal weapons.

<P>The Israeli-American-Palestinian committee will also be concerned with
the issue of smuggling explosive into PA lands. This means the CIA will
help develop security at border checkpoints. In addition, a joint committee
will be established to inspect incitement to violence in PA territory.
And the Americans will help analyze concrete threats of terrorism.

<P><B>A Dilemma for America</B>
<BR>The status of the CIA within the security arrangements means that eventually
a day will come when the CIA will be called upon to act as judge and jury.<B>
</B>The U.S. faces two major problems here; the first concerns the difficulties
in judging whether there is a violation, and the second concerns what happens
when the CIA must declare whether the Palestinians are in violation of
the agreement.

<P>It is public knowledge that the Americans delivered a separate letter
to both sides. In the letter to the Israeli side they recognized the interdependence
between the fulfillment of the agreement and the Palestinian’s carrying
out their security commitments. In this situation the CIA knows that if
it states that the Palestinians haven’t fulfilled their end of the agreement,
then the peace process will be held up, and may stop altogether. This obviously
puts the agency--and by extension the State Department--in a very tight
spot.

<P>To begin with, by what criteria is the CIA to judge whether a violation
has taken place. Here the question is whether the CIA is to examine the
<I>efforts</I> of the Palestinians or their <I>success</I> in thwarting
terror attacks. Effort is very difficult to measure, and is subject to
interpretation. While Arafat declared in Washington that he promises to
invest 100% effort, he made it clear that he can’t guarantee 100% success.

<P>But an even bigger problem faces the U.S. if--or when--it is determined
that the Palestinians are indeed in violation of the agreement. Should
such a verdict be handed down by the CIA, the Israelis will be justified
in suspending further developments in the peace process. With the future
of the peace process depending on its verdict, the CIA won’t be in any
hurry to pass such a judgement.

<P>On the other hand, the Israelis may have their own reasons to want such
a judgement to be made public, and this could cause a conflict between
the Americans and the Israelis. Should there be Palestinian violations--or
merely Israeli accusations of such violations--the Americans will be in
a dilemma whether or not to disclose the violations, and this dilemma is
very likely to bring the U.S. into conflict with Israel.

<P><B>Other risks entailed by the agreement</B>
<BR>Yet another possible risk inherent in the CIA's new role is the threat
of increased terrorism against the U.S. The publicly active role of the
CIA in fighting against Hamas and the Islamic Jihad could well cause a
backlash from these groups towards American interests in the region. This
is especially likely if the Palestinians really begin working to undermine
the infrastructure of these organizations. Because of the internal political
situation in the Palestinian Authority, these groups might prefer to blame
the Americans for their setbacks, rather than the PA. Such a step allows
them to unify their constituency against a common enemy, while preserving
Palestinian unity.

<P><B>A matter of trust</B>
<BR>The increased involvement of the CIA came at the request of the Palestinians.
Israel at first opposed the suggestion, and eventually gave in only because
it seemed the American intelligence agency was the only possible go-between
trusted by both sides. On the whole the Palestinians stand to benefit from
the arrangement and its attendant dilemmas. But while Palestinian trust
in the Americans might seem to have increased, the trust between the two
sides has definitely declined. The deepening CIA involvement in the security
arrangements could in fact be considered a failure of the direct dialogue
between the Palestinian and Israeli security authorities.
