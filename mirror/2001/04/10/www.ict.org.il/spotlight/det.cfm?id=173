<p><center><h2>Taliban Could Try bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<P>Afghanistan's Taliban Movement does not rule out the possibility of
putting Osama bin Ladin on trial.&nbsp; U.N. envoy to Afghanistan Lakhdar
Brahimi was quoted by Reuters as saying that the Taliban would be willing
to try bin Ladin if provided with sufficient evidence of his involvement
in terrorist activities.&nbsp; He said that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad
Omar even indicated the possibility of the case being decided by a joint
panel of Afghans and non-Afghans.

<P><B>Bin Ladin's presence a dilemma</B>
<BR>The Taliban leader said that his movement has asked to be presented
with evidence of bin Ladin's guilt, but has "so far not received any evidence."&nbsp;
Last month the Taliban reportedly ordered bin Ladin to cease his vocal
threats to act against U.S. interests, which were increasingly becoming
an embarrassment to the Taliban.

<P>The movement's leaders had also voiced the Taliban's "condemnation of
terrorism in all its forms," following the American air strikes on terrorist
training bases in Afghanistan.

<P>Bin Ladin moved to Afghanistan in 1996 when American pressure on his
former country of refuge, Sudan, forced him to seek asylum elsewhere.&nbsp;
He has since been living as a "guest of the Taliban" near the city of Kandahar.

<P><B>Deportation also an option</B>
<BR>The Taliban's desire to find a way out of a difficult situation was
corroborated by an earlier hint that bin Ladin could be deported to a third
country, on condition that he not be handed over to the U.S.&nbsp; This
was reported in the Arabic-language <I>Al-Hayat</I>, published in London.&nbsp;
The paper said the Taliban had informed the Saudi government of its readiness
to try bin Ladin if asked to do so by families of Saudi victims of the
1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; It was suggested
that the offer was an attempt to restore the Taliban's relations with Saudi
Arabia. The Saudis had earlier withdrawn their diplomats from Afghanistan
over the bin Ladin affair.
