<p><center><h2>Suspected Terrorists Caught in Philippines</h2></center>
<p>
<P>Security forces in the Philippines have arrested two men suspected of
belonging to Osama bin Ladin's "al-Qaida" terrorist network.&nbsp; According
to the <I>Manila Times</I>, the two, identified as Mohammed Ibrahim and
Haji Moor Mohammed Khan, were caught Monday morning at Ninoy Aquino International
Airport.&nbsp; They were carrying false passports identifying them as Greek
citizens, Andipsus Chalkis and Aidipsus Plakias.

<P>According to the <I>Times</I> report, they had obtained the counterfeit
documents in Bangkok for $2,000.&nbsp; They apparently boarded Lufthansa
Airlines flight no. LH-0744, under their own names, then changed passports
before deplaning. The flight manifesto had no record of any Greek passengers.

<P>Security at the airport was especially high due to intelligence
reports that four of bin Ladin's men would attempt to enter the country
 using European travel documents.&nbsp; The terrorists are suspected
of being involved in a plot to blow up the American Embassy in Manila.&nbsp;
The embassy had been under security alert for several weeks.

<P>At the beginning of the month, a handwritten note was found in the bathroom
of a plane that arrived in Kuwait from Dubai threatening the U.S. Embassy
in Manila. The note, written in English, said, "The American Embassy in
the Philippines will be bombed on Sept. 4, 1998."

<P>Tight security was also being implemented around the Bay View Hotel,
which had received a number of  bomb threats over the past few
days. The five-star hotel reportedly issued a memo to security personnel
containing the names and photos of at least 60 suspected terrorists.
