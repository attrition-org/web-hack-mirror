<P>Today’s terrorist attack is part of a series of attacks perpetrated
subsequent to the signing of the Wye River agreements. At present it isn't
clear whether the Palestinian Islamic Jihad or Izz e-din el-Qassam, the
military wing of Hamas, is responsible for the attack.&nbsp; The question
now is: how should the Israeli Government respond to the attack?&nbsp;
Should the peace process with the Palestinians be stopped or should it
continue as if this and the previous attacks never happened? In order to
provide an answer to this question, we should analyze the motivation of
the various parties involved:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The Palestinian Authority</B></LI>

<BR>The PA today is certainly interested in the implementation of the Wye
agreements, which will give the Palestinians control over an additional
13% of the territories. Terrorist attacks do not serve this goal, particularly
after Israel made the withdrawal conditional on active counter-terrorist
measures on the part of the Palestinian Authority. On the one hand the
PA argues that any stalling of the peace process will play into the hands
of the fundamentalists who are trying to stop the process. On the other
hand to simply ignore the attacks and continue the process as planned does
not increase the motivation of the PA and Palestinian public opinion to
go after the perpetrators of the attacks, considering that, terrorism or
no terrorism, the peace process goes on and the goals of the Palestinians
are attained.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Palestinian public opinion</B></LI>

<BR>Palestinian public opinion in a state of flux, alternating between
the desire to attain the Palestinian national goals via the peace process
(removal of Israel from the territories and the establishment of a Palestinian
state), and the support of at least part of the population for attacks
against Israel—whether from hatred and a desire for revenge, or whether
from lack of trust or other motivations. It’s important that the Palestinian
public understand that Israeli policy is founded upon the political "stick-and-carrot"
principle—in the absence of terror attacks the peace process goes forward
and the national goals of the Palestinians are attained; however when terrorist
attacks occur, the attainment of Palestinian goals is deferred.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Hamas</B></LI>

<BR>At this stage it isn’t clear whether the recent attacks were carried
by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad or by Hamas.&nbsp; If Hamas was behind
it, then were the attacks approved by Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin or not?
Did the Hamas political wing initiate the attacks, or allow them, or merely
turn a blind eye? Or were the attacks planned and executed contrary to
the position of the movement’s political leaders? At least from the Sheikh’s
public statements it would seem that he has no qualms about the perpetration
of the attacks, not to mention encouraging them. The Hamas movement depends
on the support of the Palestinian public. It is a movement that is influenced
greatly by Palestinian public opinion.&nbsp; For this reason, the means
to force the movement—or elements of it—to renounce terrorism is a combination
of firmness on the part of the Palestinian Authority, together with pressure
on the part of the Palestinian public on Hamas to cease perpetrating attacks
that put Palestinian interests at risk. The PA has tried in the past, with
some success, to prevent Hamas from carrying out attacks by persuading
the movement’s leaders that such attacks do not, at the time, serve Palestinian
interests. Occasionally the PA would make use of threats against the movement,
at times even backing up these threats with the arrest of Hamas members,
only to release them a short time later.&nbsp; So far the Palestinian Authority
has not made use of its full capabilities to undermine the widespread Hamas
infrastructure in the territories. This will be a hard step for the PA
to take—one which it will need to find justification for taking.&nbsp;
So long as the peace process continues on track after terrorist attacks,
from the Palestinian point of view there is no justification for declaring
all-out war on Hamas.&nbsp; Only if there is a real threat to Palestinian
national interests (13% withdrawal, for example) can the PA make use of
this threat in order to act energetically to advance its national interests.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Israeli public opinion</B></LI>

<BR>The Israeli public—like any other society—cannot tolerate a situation
in which discussions are underway, and concessions made, while at the same
time the personal security of the citizens is compromised with each new
terror attack. No government can remain long in power if it ignores its
constituency’s demands for a reaction to terrorism—whether that reaction
is political or military. (This was one of the main reasons for the change
in government in Israel in 1996.)</UL>
<B>Recommendations</B>
<BR>From all of the above, it follows that Israel must apply the "carrot-and-stick"
principle in its political relations with the Palestinians. In the absence
of terror attacks, the peace process goes forward, to the profit of the
national interests of the Palestinians; whereas terrorist attacks delay
the furtherance of these interests. The Israeli government should resolve
that after an attack the implementation of&nbsp; the Wye agreements will
be suspended for a predetermined and limited period, for example one month—time
enough for both Palestinians and Israelis to take stock after the attack.
The government should also announce that in the absence of attacks the
peace process will continue on course immediately at the end of this period
of suspension.&nbsp; In the event of further attacks taking place within
this period Israel will consider the various possible reactions according
to the specifics of the attack. Such specifics could include, for example,
whether the Palestinian Authority could have prevented the attack; whether
the political wing of hamas initiated the attack or had prior knowledge
of the attack; or alternately whether the attack was an individual initiative
or carried out by Islamic Jihad or Hamas activists without the knowledge
and instruction of the organizations’ leadership.

<P>This position will no doubt spark severe criticism from the Palestinian
side and from other elements, since it demonstrates to the Palestinians
that there is a political price to terrorism. At the same time, while not
endangering the process as a whole, it will increase the Palestinian Authority’s
motivation to combat terrorism, while providing it with the means to explain
to the Palestinian people the reasons for its activities against Hamas.
