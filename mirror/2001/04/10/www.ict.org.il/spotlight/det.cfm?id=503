<p><center><h2>U.S. Warship Targeted by Suicide Attack in Yemen</h2></center>
<p><P>U.S. authorities are treating an explosion that killed 17 sailors
and injured 33 yesterday in a Yemeni port as a terrorist attack. A large
hole was blown in the side of the USS Cole, one of the most advanced destroyers
in the U.S. navy. Eleven people are still missing.

<P>The explosion occurred at 12:15 local time, when a small boat--apparently 
a rubber Zodiac craft--pulled up alongside the Cole, ostensibly to assist with mooring lines. Witnesses
said they saw two men in the boat stand at attention moments before detonation.
U.S. officials are treating the incident as a suicide attack.

<P><B>Attack was well-planned</B>
<BR>American security sources say the attack was well-planned. The USS
Cole is a heavily armed and well-protected vessel. The ship had made a
fueling stop in Aden harbor on its way to the Persian Gulf in order to
enforce the naval blockade on Iraq. The refueling stop was only scheduled
to last between four and six hours and was not well-publicized.

<P>The Yemeni authorities had received advance notice of the stopover less
than two weeks prior to the docking. The bombers would have needed to plan
their attack on short notice and be in a position to infiltrate the harbor
at the appropriate time. They would also have needed to know what part
of the ship to target, as well as having the necessary skills to assemble
a bomb powerful enough to penetrate the ship's metal plating.

<P>Navy Adm. Vern Clark, Chief of Naval Operations, was quoted by ABC News
as saying, "A boat that was involved in mooring would not be expected to
be a threat." The explosion blew a 10 meter-wide hole in the ship, heavily 
damaging the main and auxiliary engine rooms. Casualties were higher due to
the fact that most of crewmen in the targeted regions were at their stations
for the docking.  

<P><B>British Embassy bombed</B>
<BR>On Friday morning, a small bomb detonated outside the British Embassy
in Sana'a, shattering windows but causing no casualties. A British Embassy
spokeswoman was quoted by ABC News as saying that the explosion was close
the embassy's generator in the courtyard of the building.

<P>There were unconfirmed reports that a small device was tossed over the
wall into the building's courtyard in the early hours of the morning. Only
a Yemeni night guard was on duty at the time.

<P><B>Osama bin Ladin link?</B>
<BR>The Pentagon has sent investigators to the scene to piece together
the sequence of events and start a hunt for the culprits. As yet no formal
claims of responsibility have been received.

<P>A number of Islamist extremist groups have a presence in Yemen, among
them Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. While there is some speculation
that these groups could have carried out the attack in response to a perceived
American support of Israel, most point out that neither of these groups
has targeted American interests in the past nor threatened to do so.

<P>On the other hand, several other radical Islamic groups have made such
threats, and could have been in a position to carry them out. The Egyptian
Islamic Jihad and the al-Gama'at Islamiyyah both have a strong presence
in Yemen. Both groups support Osama bin Ladin's al-Qaidah network. Al-Qaidah
maintains businesses and training camps in Yemen.

<P>In December 1998, the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, an group with loose
ties to bin Ladin, kidnapped 16 Western tourists in southern Yemen. Four
of the tourists died in a rescue attempt by the Yemeni government. The
U.S. State Department issued a travel warning in February of this year,
warning Americans against travel to Yemen.

<P>Previous terrorist attacks seven years ago caused all American
military personnel to be withdrawn form Yemen. In January 1993 the U.S.
Embassy was targeted by bombings, along with several hotels housing Americans.
Osama bin Ladin's al-Qaidah is suspected to have carried out at least two
of the bombings.

<P>Citing security concerns, The U.S. has ordered the closure of a number of 
its embassies until next week. American embassies in 13 Arab and seven 
African nations and Pakistan have been told to remain closed to the
public until Monday.
