<p><center><h2>International Anti-Terrorism Campaign Bears Fruit</h2></center>
<p>As the millennium celebrations approach, security forces in several Middle
Eastern countries have launched an unprecedented campaign to thwart possible
attacks by terrorist elements. With the latest wave of arrests of potential
terrorists the level of cooperation between American and
Middle Eastern security forces has reached a new high. In the majority
of cases, those arrested were said to have links to Osama bin Ladin and
his Al-Qaidah network.
<P>In the U.S. and Canada authorities are attempting to unravel the chain
of events that lead an Algerian to attempt to smuggle a truckfull of bomb-making
materials into Washington State from Canada. Ahmed Ressan was arrested
last Tuesday after he allegedly boarded a ferry to Port Angeles from Victoria,
British Columbia. Ressan had been turned down for refugee status in Canada
because he was suspected of belonging to the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
the Algerian terrorist group held responsible for bombings in France and
countless massacres in their own country.

<p><b>Turkey and the Iranian connection</b>
<br>Turkey's Counter-Terrorism units have been put on alert against possible
terrorist attacks several times over the past few months. In October security
forces captured several Islamic militants allegedly connected with al-Qaidah,
who attempted to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran. According to <i>Al-Watan
el-Arabi,</i> the interrogation of the militants revealed that a "commando
unit" affiliated with Osama bin Ladin had infiltrated into Turkey across
the Iranian border. The results of the interrogations prompted Turkish
intelligence to inform their counterparts in Europe of the possibility
of action by bin Ladin's network in their countries.
<p>A Turkish intelligence report called attention to the statement of one
of the captured militants to the effect that the unit was trained by an
Iranian official from the city of Tevriz. Most of the unit's members infiltrated
from Iran, while others entered Turkey by way of European countries, such
as Italy and Bosnia. The report said that two additional infiltrators were
still in Iran waiting to cross over into Turkey. According to the Turkish
report, the militants were financed by bin Ladin and infiltrated into Turkey
on his orders.
<p>The Turkish authorities said that six members of an eight member team
crossed into Turkey from Iran on 11 June, 1999 and are currently at large
somewhere in Turkey. The unit was said to include four Iranian Kurds and
two Algerians, all of whom were carrying forged passports. An Egyptian
Islamist in exile confirmed that such a manhunt was underway, but insisted
that the suspects were in no way affiliated with bin Ladin. He was speaking
to the Arabic-language paper <i>Al-Hayyat.</i>
<p>On December 6, Turkish police detained six Libyans suspected of planning
an attack against American diplomatic targets. According to the Turkish
media, security forces received intelligence information that a terrorist
cell affiliated with Osama bin Ladin had infiltrated into Turkey. 
They were reportedly planning an attack on the American embassy in Ankara.
The suspects, who claim to be Libyan dissidents, were charged with traveling
on false passports and possession of forgery materials.
<p><b>Arrests in Jordan linked to American travel warning</b>
<br>Last week Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Raouf al-Rawabdeh announced
that Jordanian security forces had arrested a group of eleven Jordanian
nationals, an Iraqi and an Algerian on suspicion of planning terrorist
attacks.
<p>Jordanian officials said the group was plotting attacks on Christian
pilgrimage sites in the Hashemite kingdom. Three suspects were still being 
sought outside of Jordan.
<P>A Jordanian official was quoted by AFP as saying, "The ring
that was smashed was funded in particular by Omar Abu Omar, also known
as Abu Qatadah, who is a right-hand man of Osama Bin Laden."

<P>Omar Mahmoud Abu Omar is well known to Jordanian security forces.
In 1998 he was sentenced <i>in absentia</I> for his part in a series of bomb blasts
in Amman at the beginning of 1998, one of which targeted the former official of Jordanian military
intelligence.

<P>Abu Omar was the ideologue of a group known as
“The movement of reform and challenge” (<I>Harakat al-Islah wal-Tahaddi</I>). 
He was granted political asylum in the UK. In the last few
years Abu Omar served as one of the editors of “<I>Al-Ansar</I>,” the official 
publication of GIA. He published his radical Islamic ideas in a book 
<I>Between two Methods</I> (<I>Bayn al-Minhajayn</I>).

<P>The leader of the Afghan-trained group was identified as Khader Abu Ghoshah. In 1993
Abu Ghoshah was sentence to a jail term in Jordan for several bombings.
He was released before his sentence was served out by a royal pardon. From
Jordan he traveled to Afghanistan, where, according to Jordanian security
forces, he was trained in explosives and bomb-making. Abu Ghoshah formed
a group called Jaish Mohammed (the army of Mohammed), comprising veterans
of the Afghan conflict. Jordanian officials say the group was behind some
of the bombings last year in the Kingdom.

<P>The unnamed Jordanian source quoted by the AFP said that the security
forces had the Afghan group under surveillance shortly after they returned
to Jordan, but waited to make arrests until all its members could be detained.
The clampdown came on December 5, after the last members of the group,
most of whom travelled on false passports, were once more back in the country.
<p>The arrests were linked to an American travel warning to its citizens
traveling abroad that terrorists could be seeking to target Americans.
The <a href="http://travel.state.gov/wwc_terrorist.html" target="_new">travel
warning</a> cited "credible evidence that terrorists are planning attacks
specifically targeting American citizens" over the New Year, which this
year coincides with the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
<p><b>Taliban arrests alleged Western spy</b>
<br>On 13 October, a man reported to be an aide to Osama bin Ladin, Mahrez
Hamduni was apprehended at Istanbul's international airport during the
course of a police action in which Interpol was also involved. He was said
to be carrying a Bosnian passport. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, a man called
Khalil al-Deek, also called Abu Ayed was arrested on suspicion of having close ties with bin Ladin.
Abu Ayed, an American-Jordanian who holds a US passport was extradited to Jordan at the request of the Jordanian government on December 16.
<p>Senior Afghani sources told <i>Al-Hayyat</i> that the arrest of  Hamduni
may be connected to the arrest of a suspected "Western spy." A young Jordanian
man, identified as Abu al-Mubtasim was arrested by the Taliban on suspicion
of providing information on the movements of Osama
bin Ladin's network to "a foreign country.".
