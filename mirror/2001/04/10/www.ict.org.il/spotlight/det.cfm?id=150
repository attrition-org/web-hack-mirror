<p><center><h2>Muslim Groups Condemn Cape Town Bombing</h2></center>
<p>

<P>Eighteen of South Africa's Muslim organizations have published a joint
statement condemning the bombing of the Planet Hollywood restaurant on
August 25. In the statement, quoted by the South African <I>Electronic
Mail&amp;Guardian</I>, the groups say: "The South African Muslim community
condemns in the strongest possible terms the bombing of the restaurant
in Cape Town. We call on the government to spare no effort in tracking
down the perpetrators of this outrageous deed.

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>"We also want to add a note of caution that while there
is speculation as to the identity of the bombers it will be extremely irresponsible,
unfair and perhaps dangerous to prematurely blame any particular group
until the investigation is completed and the evidence has been gathered."</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0></FONT>

<P>ABC News said that eleven Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders had hung
bouquets of red and white roses on the coils of barbed wire erected around
the restaurant. A Muslim religious leader, Mohammed Moerat, was quoted
as saying, “None of our religions condones this barbarism.&nbsp; Such despicable
actions can only serve to turn all people of good will against the perpetrators.”<FONT SIZE=+0></FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Cape Town vigilantes implicated</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+0>Meanwhile the investigation continues into who planted
the bomb.&nbsp; </FONT>Some time after the explosion a man claiming to
represent Muslims Against Global Oppression phoned a local radio correspondent,
claiming that the restaurant bomb was in in retaliation for U.S. missile
strikes against terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. However, another
spokesman for the group strongly denied that they were involved and even
condemned the attack.

<P>South Africa's Muslims--numbering about 500,000--make up roughly 1 percent
of the population.&nbsp; It is estimated that only a very small minority
could be described as "radical."&nbsp; However, this radical minority has
made its presence felt on the local scene, leading protests against the
U.S and Israel,&nbsp; fighting it out with local criminal gangs and campaigning
in mosques for Muslim youths to join the battle to overthrow the government
and set up an Islamic state.

<P>The most active of the local militant groups is a Muslim vigilante organization
called People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad).&nbsp; This group has
targeted suspected gangsters and drug dealers, but has also attacked moderate
Muslim religious leaders and scholars. It has increasingly come under the
influence of a Muslim fundamentalist group called "Kibla" ("Direction")
led by Ahmed Cassim.&nbsp; According to intelligence sources and former
members of Pagad, Cassim has recently conducted a "purge" of non-Islamic
members of the organization. His stated aim, and that of his group, is
the establishment of an Islamic state in South Africa.

<P>The <I>Electronic Mail&amp;Guardian</I> reported that in the 1980s some
of Kibla's members were sent to Libya for military training. The organization
claimed responsibility for an attack on an Athlone tavern in 1984, for
which two of its members served prison terms. Since the Kibla "take-over"
of Pagad, the organization has been implicated in a number of pipe-bombings,
against both criminal gangs and against moderate Muslim religious leaders.

<P>Based on the available evidence, South African intelligence services
believe that Pagad or its supporters may be behind the Planet Hollywood
bombing. As for Muslims Against Global Oppression, former Pagad members
described the organization as a "cut-out" used by Pagad for specific campaigns.
One former Pagad member quoted by the <I>Mail&amp;Guardian</I> said that,
"The organization does not exist. It is a front name used by Pagad when
anti-imperialist campaigns are launched."

<P><B>FBI to help in the investigation</B>
<BR>American FBI investigators, already busy with the investigations underway
in Nairobi and in Tanzania, have joined the hunt for the perpetrators of
the Planet Hollywood bombing.&nbsp; Police say that just prior to the blast,
the restaurant's security cameras picked up a "Moroccan-looking" man, believed
to be a Zimbabwean, who may have planted the bomb. The authorities are
offering a $40,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of those responsible for the bombing.

<P>Security has been stepped up at American businesses and government offices
in South Africa.&nbsp; American restaurant chains such as McDonald's have
begun giving special instruction to their staffs in dealing with suspicious
objects or people.&nbsp; Some businesses have hired extra security staff
through private companies.
