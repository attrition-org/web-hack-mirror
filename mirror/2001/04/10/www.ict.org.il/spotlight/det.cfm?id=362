<p><center><h2>Turkish Police Arrest Terrorism Suspects</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Turkish police have detained six Libyans suspected of planning an attack
against American diplomatic targets. According to the Turkish media, security
forces received intelligence information that a terrorist cell affiliated
with Osama bin Ladin had infiltrated into Turkey. They were reportedly
planning an attack on the American embassy in Ankara.
<p>Roadblocks and checkpoints were set up along the Istanbul-Ankara road
throughout the night Saturday and into Sunday morning in order to try to
apprehend the suspects. Early Sunday morning the six were arrested at a
bus station. Turkish news agency IHA identified the suspects as Mohammed
Raoi, Mohammed Delal, Khalifa Sactani, Rashid Nahi and Lamiyet Yousouf.
<p>The suspects, who claim to be Libyan dissidents were charged with traveling
on false passports and possession of forgery materials. No connection has
so far been found with bin Ladin's organization, al-Qaidah.
<p><b>Turkey considered an "easy target" for infiltrators</b>
<br>Turkey's Counter-Terrorism units have been put on alert against possible
terrorist attacks several times over the past few months. In October security
forces captured several militants allegedly connected with al-Qaidah. 
The militants were caught attempting to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran.
<p>According to <I>Al-Watan el-Arabi,</I> the interrogation of the Islamic militants
revealed that a "commando unit" affiliated with Osama bin Ladin infiltrated
into Turkey across the Iranian border. The results of the interrogations
prompted Turkish intelligence to inform their counterparts in Europe of
the possibility of action by bin Ladin's network in their countries.
<p>According to the Turkish report, the militants were financed by bin
Ladin and infiltrated into Turkey on his orders. Their purpose was to perpetrate
terrorist attacks during last month's summit on European Cooperation
and Security.
Turkey has long been considered a particularly easy target for Islamic
militants to infiltrate due to porous borders and the long-running Kurdish
conflict.
<p>The Turkish authorities said that six members of an eight member team
crossed into Turkey from Iran on 11 June, 1999 and are currently at large
somewhere in Turkey. The unit is said to include four Kurds and two Algerians,
all of whom are carrying forged passports. On 13 October an aide to Osama
bin Ladin, Mahrez Hamduni was apprehended at Istanbul's international airport
during the course of a police action in which Interpol was also involved.
He was said to be carrying a Bosnian passport.
<p><b>The Iranian connection</b>
<br>According to U.S. and Israeli intelligence sources Iran has stepped
up its support to Middle Eastern terrorist organizations. There are some
indications that the Iranian government is also giving limited support
to Islamic terrorist organizations elsewhere in the world. More serious
is the implied connection between bin Ladin's network and the Iranian government.
<p>A Turkish intelligence report called attention to the statement of one
of the captured militants to the effect that the unit was trained by an
Iranian official from the city of Tevriz. Most of the unit's members infiltrated
from Iran, while others entered Turkey by way of European countries, such
as Italy and Bosnia. The report said that two additional infiltrators were
still in Iran waiting to cross over into Turkey.
<p>According to the Turkish Counter-Terrorist forces, bin Ladin's militants
intended to target American and British diplomatic missions. Information
to this affect obtained from foreign intelligence sources was disseminated
three months ago to local security forces, who were directed to beef up
security around American and British embassies.
