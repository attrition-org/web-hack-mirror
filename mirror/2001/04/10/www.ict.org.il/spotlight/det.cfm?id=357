<p><center><h2>Turkish Court Upholds Ocalan
Death Sentence</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Turkey's appeals court upheld the death sentence handed down on Kurdish
separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan, head of the Kurdistan Worker's
Party (PKK) was sentenced to death after being declared guilty of separatist
treason in violation of Turkish Penal Code (TCK) Law No. 125 by the Ankara
No. 2 State Security Court (DGM) on June 29, 1999.
<p>Ocalan's sentence was handed down on June 29 by a three-member panel
of judges on the Turkish island of Imrali. The Turks hold Ocalan responsible
for the deaths of 37,000 people as a result of his 15-year battle for Kurdish
separatism.
<p>In order for the death penalty to be carried out in Turkey--which has
not happened since 1984--Parliament must pass a special law for execution
of the sentence in question.
<p><b>From guerilla leader to political martyr</b>
<br>Throughout his trial Ocalan has been at pains to portray himself as
a peacemaker. He offered to act as a restraining influence on his organization
if his life were spared, had called on the Ankara government to negotiate
with the PKK for a peaceful and democratic solution to the Kurdish problem.
Turkish authorities have, at least publicly, refused to negotiate with
the PKK.
<p>In August the PKK announced that it was withdrawing its forces from
Turkey, though isolated clashes with Turkish forces continue. The 
withdrawal paves the way for a further demilitarization and further politicization
of the PKK. Some analysts say the PKK cease-fire is merely making a virtue
of necessity, as the organization has been militarily weakened by successive
Turkish army operations in southwestern Turkey and northern Iraq. Politicization
and demilitarization will help the PKK in its attempt to win European support
for its fight for a Kurdish homeland.
<p><b>Delicate situation</b>
<br>Ocalan warned that his execution would embroil Turkey in a bloodbath,
as Kurdish separatists took the law into their own hands. "Thousands of
people will start the terror machine for me," he warned. Certainly the
execution of Ocalan could have ramifications for Turkey's desire to join
the European Union.&nbsp;
<p>Husnu Ondul, Chairman of the Human Rights Association was quoted by
Reuters as saying, "This is a delicate and dangerous situation. Abdullah
Ocalan is a personality whom millions of people hate, just as another group
of millions follow him for this or that reason." The confirmation of the
death sentence, while bringing Ocalan closer to execution, could boost
his position as a political rather than a military leader. However, said
Ondul, "it will also strengthen those in the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party)
who still favor armed struggle for Kurdish cause."
<p><b>Defense appeals to European Court of Human Rights</b>
<br>Ocalan's lawyers have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights
for a stay of execution. The European Court will examine the case next
week, however the Court's ruling is not expected to be handed down earlier
than six months and could well take a full year. The European Court could
ask Turkish authorities to take such a decision as a "temporary measure"
until the Courts in Strasbourg has time to hand down a ruling on the Ocalan
case.
<p>Rulings by the European Court are limited to demonstrating whether or
not there was a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. It
would then pass on to the executive organ of the Council of Europe to exercise
any pressure on authorities of the country involved.
<p>The lengthy process could work not only to Ocalan's advantage, but Turkey's
as well. As passions over the issue cool, the Turkish government will have
time to weigh its options. Turkey is seeking to join the European Union,
all of whose current members oppose the death penalty. It is likely that
during the intervening months the issue of abolishing the death penalty
in Turkey will resurface.
<p>In addition, while executing Ocalan would satisfy public opinion, especially
the families of the many soldiers who died in the fight
against the PKK, it could also make of Ocalan a martyr, a symbol to many
Kurds who have hitherto rejected his violent methods. The Turks have no
desire to make of Ocalan a rallying point for the continuation of the conflict.
