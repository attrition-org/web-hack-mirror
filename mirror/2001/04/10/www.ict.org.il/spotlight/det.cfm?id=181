<p><center><h2>Hizballah, Hamas Call for Arafat's Assassination</h2></center>
<p>
<P>Hizballah leader Sheikh Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah called on Palestinians
to take matters into their own hands and "bring down the traitor Arafat."
Speaking at a rally in Damascus on Saturday, Nasrallah said that the Wye
agreements were "worse than the Balfour Declaration, since the British
who promised Palestine to the Jews were not speaking on behalf of the Palestinian
people [as Arafat is]."&nbsp; The rally was organized by the Palestinian
Islamic Jihad to commemorate the third anniversary of the assassination
of the group's founder Fathi Shqaqi, killed by alleged Israeli agents in
Malta in 1995.

<P>Hassan Nasrallah's comments echoed those of Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, who criticized Arafat for signing the Wye agreement, but
stopped short of calling him a traitor. Nasrallah accused Arafat of working
for many years to eliminate all opposition to his plot to "sell Palestine
to the Zionists."&nbsp; "When Arafat and his supporters gather in Gaza
to sign the nullification of parts of the Palestinian National Charter,
they will be signing the death sentences of traitors," he said.

<P><B>Call to jihad</B>
<BR>Nasrallah said the responsibilities of the Palestinians are larger
and more critical than ever before.&nbsp; Just what those responsibilities
are he outlined more fully at a second gathering on Sunday in Beirut. There
he called for the Palestinians to rise up against "the traitor Arafat."&nbsp;
"Is there no Palestinian who can do as did Khaled Islambouli [the killer
of Anwar Sadat] and proclaim that Arafat's presence on the face of this
earth is shameful to the Palestinians and the Muslims?" he demanded.

<P>Calling the Wye agreement a sellout, Nasrallah said, “It’s possible
to bring down the agreement. It’s been done before. It will fail when we
take to the streets and kill Jewish soldiers and settlers. Even the Israelis
themselves will rise up against Netanyahu.” He called upon Palestinians
to declare Jihad against the Jews, and to use every means to foil the implementation
of the agreement.

<P><B>Hamas threatens to turn its guns on the Palestinian Authority</B>
<BR>Hamas has also joined in the condemnation of Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority. The Palestinian Authority has recently arrested or detained
a number of the organization's followers, in the wake of a suicide bomber's
attempt to blow up a busload of Israeli school children. An anonymous caller
to Israel Radio took responsibility for the attack in the name of Hamas.
Although some security authorities have questioned the authenticity of
the claim, it provided the PA with the necessary motivation to crack down
on Hamas activists. Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was placed under house
arrest, in an unprecedented move by Palestinian security forces.

<P>Formerly reluctant to confront the PA directly, for fear of igniting
a civil war, the organization has apparently elected to throw caution to
the winds. A statement faxed to the media, and attributed to Hamas' military
wing Izz e-din al-Qassam warns the Palestinian Authority that continued
"oppressive measures" against the Islamic fighters "may push many of the
sons of Hamas and its military wing, because of savage pressures, to reject
abiding by the orders and guidance of their leaders and to direct their
war and guns, out of necessity, against the Authority's security apparatus."

<P>However, a leader of the organization's political wing, Abu Shanab,
has called the authenticity of the statement into question.&nbsp; Saying
that the threats violate Hamas policy, he went on to say that "Hamas seeks
to spare the Palestinian society the evil of fighting regardless of circumstances
or causes." Shanab also denied the claim that Hamas was responsible for
last week's suicide bombing. He was quoted by Reuters as saying that the
attack was "heroic" but added, "the information we have confirms that it
was not Hamas and that there were other parties which stood behind it."
