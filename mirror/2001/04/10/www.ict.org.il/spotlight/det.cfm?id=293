<p><center><h2>Turkey Arrests PKK Activist in Europe</h2></center>
<p><p>Turkey announced that a senior Kurdish rebel had been seized and brought
to Turkey from Europe. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said, "A man said to
be very important within the PKK has been captured in a European country
in a very successful operation and brought to Turkey." He did not immediately
identify the man, but claimed that he was the number two man in the PKK.
<p>The Turkish intelligence agency, MIT identified the man as Cevat Soysal,
alias Cemil-Mehmet Hoca, and said that he was "detected during a journey,
captured and brought to Turkey." An MIT statement quoted by the Turkish
Anatolian news agency claimed that Soysal was involved in "extensive efforts
in Europe and the Middle East to gain militants for the PKK" and that he
was "given orders to PKK rebels in Turkey to carry out acts of violence."
<p><b>Soysal was "handed over by Moldova"</b>
<br>However the PKK downplayed the importance of Soysal in the organization,
and claimed that he was handed over to Turkey by Moldova. The Kurdistan
National Liberation Front (ERNK), the political wing of the PKK sent a
statement to the Kurdish DEM news agency saying, "Cevat Soysal was not
captured in a 'secret' operation by the Turkish state, but was arrested
by the Moldovan state and handed over to the Turkish state."
<p>The leader of the Kurdish community in Moldova, Hamghin Abdullah, was
quoted by the BBC as saying that Soysal was detained on 13 July when he
went out to make a telephone call to Germany. Soysal had been living in
Germany for 14 years, where he was granted political asylum. Soysal had
been carrying German travel documents when he was detained.
<p>Security officials in southeast Turkey said Soysal had served time in
prison as a teenager for belonging to the PKK. He was freed from Diyarbakir
jail in 1986. He was arrested in December 1979 in Batman and sentenced
to 21 years in prison by a court in the southeastern Turkish province of
Diyarbakir on charges of being a "member of an organization that seeks
to divide Turkish territory to set up a separate state." However the sentence
was commuted to 14 years as Soysal was under 18 years of age at the time.
He was released after serving six years in Diyarbakir prison.
<p><b>"Not a senior member"</b>
<br>The ERNK statement claimed that Soysal was a member of the ERNK's European
branch and not a PKK member responsible for Europe. However, Ocalan during
interrogation named Soysal as was in charge of training PKK members abroad,
particularly in Romania. Turkish intelligence officials said that Soysal
was involved in training PKK militants and organizing pro-PKK activities
in Europe and Middle East, and that he had also been organizing PKK teams
in Turkey "in developing mass violence." According to MIT Soysal's importance
had increased since Ocalan's arrest.
<p>A spokeswoman for the ERNK admitted that Soysal was a PKK activist "but
not a senior member." Researchers at ICT concur. "His name does not appear
on the list of the 'big ones,'" said Dr. Ely Karmon, "He is not particularly
influential."
