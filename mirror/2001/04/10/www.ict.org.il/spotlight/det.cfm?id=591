<p><center><h2>Verdict Reached in Millennium Bomb Plot
</h2></center>
<p>An Algerian caught smuggling explosives across the Canadian border into
 the U.S. has been convicted of terrorism by a California court. Ahmed Ressam,
 33, was found guilty on Friday of conspiracy to commit terrorism, document 
fraud and possession of deadly explosives.  </p> <p>Other counts include placing an explosive in proximity to a ferry terminal, 
smuggling, transporting explosives and carrying an explosive during the commission 
of a felony. Jurors also found that his actions were committed in connection 
with a crime of violence.</p> Ressam faces a possible sentence of 130 years in prison when he is sentenced 
later this year. His lawyers say he intends to appeal the conviction. Sentencing 
is scheduled for June 28. <b><br> <br> "A terrorist attack on the United States of America was stopped in its  tracks"</b><br> Ressam was arrested on Dec. 14, 1999 in Washington state trying to enter
the United States from Canada with 60 kg of explosives and four timing devices--enough
 to make at least four high-powered bombs--hidden in the trunk of his rental
 car. "A terrorist attack on the United States of America was stopped in
its  tracks," Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Hamilton said, referring to
the day customs officials arrested Ressam as he drove off a ferry from British
Columbia.<br> <p>It was never clear whether the bombs were intended for four different targets
or whether they were intended to be set off in rapid succession in or around
the same target. Police found that Ressam had reserved a motel room near
the city's landmark Space Needle. An accomplice who had apparently traveled
with Ressam was believed to be still at large--possibly in the United States.</p> <p>This, together with the arrest of two additional Algerians suspected in 
involvement in the plot, lead to the cancellation of public millennium celebrations 
in Seattle were canceled as a precaution. One of the arrested men, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, an Algerian, pleaded guilty to conspiracy last month and agreed to
testify against Ressam in exchange for leniency. </p> <p>A second witnesses was a French official who has been working to link Ressam
with a terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>Ressam's trial was moved from Seattle to Los Angeles by Coughenour, who
 feared that pretrial publicity would make a fair trial more difficult to
achieve. For much the same reasons, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour barred
prosecutors from mentioning the connection with Osama bin Ladin. It was thought
that mention of the Saudi dissident's name during Ressam's trial would prejudice 
the jurors and preclude a fair trial.</p> <p><b><b>Ressam convicted in France the same day</b><br> </b>It was Ressam's second criminal conviction in a single day. A French
court earlier found him guilty <i>in absentia</i> of belonging to an Islamic
terrorist organization and sentenced him to five years in prison. </p> <p>Also convicted in France was Fateh Kamel, who was sentenced to eight years
in prison for organizing a network of safe&nbsp; houses and false identity
papers for Islamic rebels in Europe and Canada and planning terrorist attacks
in France in 1996.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kamel, 40, holds both Canadian and Algerian passports and is seen by U.S.
officials as teh European link to Ressam. French authorities accuse him of
headed a network extending from Turkey&nbsp; to Canada that provided false
passports and other documents to Islamic militants so they could move about
with ease. </p> <p>Ressam and Kamel were among two dozen people who stood trial, of whom,
seventeen were handed sentences of between six years and 16 months.<br> </p> <p>Ressam is also wanted by authorities in Canada, who accuse him with assembling
bomb-making materials in a Vancouver motel. Several other suspects in plotting
to execute millennium attacks are still awaiting trial around the world.&nbsp;
Jordanian authorities this week named two more fugitive suspects linked to
a terrorist conspiracy to stage attacks in the United States and Israel during
millennium celebrations. Six men have been sentenced to death in the case.<br> <br> Ressam's accomplice, Abdel-Majid Dahoumane was arrested at the end of March
by Algerian security forces. He was reportedly detained on his return from
Afghanistan, where he had undergone arms and explosives training. Another
suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, arrested in Canada following Ressam's arrest, is
awaiting trial in New York.<br> </p> <b>Sources: Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times</b><br> <b><br> <br>
