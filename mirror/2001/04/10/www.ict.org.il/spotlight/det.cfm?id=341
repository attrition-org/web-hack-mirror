<p><center><h2>UN Imposes Sanctions on Taliban over Bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p><P>The United Nations Security Council voted on Friday to impose sanctions
on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan unless it surrenders Osama bin Ladin
within 30 days.

<P>The <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19991015.sc6739.doc.html" target="_new">resolution</a>, 
which was drafted by the United States, freezes the
Taliban's overseas assets and bans flights owned, leased or operated by
the Taliban from taking off or landing internationally. The resolution
passed unanimously.

<P>The Security Council demanded that the Islamist faction hand over bin
Ladin "without further delay to a country where he has been indicted" or
"to appropriate authorities in a country where he will be arrested and
effectively brought to justice." The exiled Saudi billionaire was indicted
in the United States for the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in August 1998.

<P>The Taliban was given until November 14 to surrender bin Ladin, after
which the sanctions will go into effect. UN member states will be required
to "deny permission for any aircraft to take off from or land in their
territory if it is owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of the Taliban."
States are also required to "freeze funds and other financial resources,
including funds generated from property owned or controlled directly by
the Taliban."

<P>Exemptions to the flight ban include flights for humanitarian reasons
or to allow Afghan citizens to perform the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

<P>More sweeping sanctions against the Taliban were imposed by the United
States earlier this year. On July 4 President Clinton signed an <A HREF="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=26">executive
order</A> prohibiting trade or transactions with the Taliban or in territory
controlled by the Taliban, thus preventing any U.S. investment in Afghanistan.
It also freezes any Taliban-owned assets within U.S. jurisdiction and allowed
for the seizure of the Afghanistan airline's $500 million in U.S. assets.

<P>The U.S. has tried repeatedly to persuade the Taliban to extradite bin
Laden to the United States, or to a third country to stand trial for his
role in the August 1998 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Taliban has refused. Bin Ladin now enjoys the dubious fame of appearing
on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list, with a $5 million price on his head. There
are indications that he may be in financial troubles, after his assets
abroad were frozen by the several western countries. It is unknown how
much capital he has tied up in anonymous accounts and "cover" companies. 

<P>The Taliban denounced Friday's vote on the resolution. Abdul Hakeem
Mujahid, the movement's representative in New York, was quoted by the Associated
Press as saying it would cause suffering to the people of Afghanistan and
would undermining efforts to resolve the bin Ladin issue by diplomacy.
"We did want to solve the problem by talks and negotiations and still it
is our policy," Mujahid said. "But putting pressure, it will have more
negative effects than the positive ones, and it will make the problem more
complicated than it was before."
