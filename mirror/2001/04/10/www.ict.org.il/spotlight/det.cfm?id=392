<p><center><h2>Arrest of Mauritanian Could Link bin Ladin to Anti-U.S. Bomb
Plot</h2></center>
<p>
<p>The recent arrest of a man in West Africa has provided investigators
with the first real link between a group of Algerians accused of planning
a bombing in the U.S. and exiled Saudi militant Osama bin Ladin.
<p>Mohambedou Ould Slahi, a Mauritanian was detained last Wednesday in
Senegal, reportedly due to the fact that his name appeared on an Interpol watch list. Prior to showing up in Senegal, he had been under investigation in Canada in connection
with the bomb plot. He reportedly fled the country when the investigation got too
close.
<p><b>Cash flow traced from bin Ladin
company to Slahi</b>
<br>According to one account, Slahi is related by marriage to Khaled Al-Shanquiti,
also known as "The Mauritanian," a key business associate of Saudi expatriate
Osama bin Ladin. Although investigators have said that the relationship
is not certain, they confirmed the link to bin Ladin.
<p>Slahi, an electrical engineer allegedly ran an import export company
in Germany called "Ould Slahi G.M.B.H." The company is now suspected of
being a front for the transferal of funds to Islamic militants operating from
Europe.
<p>In October of last year Slahi dropped out of sight, reappearing on Nov.
26 in Montreal, Canada. There he reportedly worked with Mokhtar
Haouari, the Algerian suspected of working out the logistics of the attack.
Slahi is also suspected of meeting with Ahmed Ressam, who on December 14 was was caught attempting to smuggle a carload of explosives across the U.S.
Border.
<p>Investigators say that in 1998 Slahi received thousands of dollars in
a bank transfer from Khaled Al-Shanquiti in Khartoum, Sudan. He is said
to have had "constant communications" with one of bin Ladin's construction
companies in Khartoum, thought to be a front for bin Ladin's al-Qaidah
organization.
<p><b>FBI to question Slahi in Mauritania</b>
<br>According to local media reports Slahi was detained for questioning
for a few hours at the Dakar airport in Senegal then allowed to
continue on to his native Mauritania. Upon his arrival in Nouakchott he
was taken into custody by Mauritanian authorities, apparently at the request on the
United States government.
<p>FBI agents who had been enroute to Senegal will now be granted permission
to question Slahi in Mauritania. It isn't clear whether the United States
will put in a request for Slahi's extradition. He is currently being held
at the offices of the Bureau of Mauritanian Security.
<p>Meanwhile a Moroccan man was arrested on yesterday when he attempted to cross
the U.S. border from Canada. Youssef Karroum was listed in U.S. officials'
computers as an associate of Ahmed Ressam. The car Karroum was driving
tested positive to explosive residue, but no explosives were found. He
is currently being held as a material witness, and no criminal charges
have been filed against him.
