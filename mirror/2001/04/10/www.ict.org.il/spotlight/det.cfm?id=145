<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas is stating its harsh condemnation
to the traitorous American aggression on Sudan and Afghanistan. This aggression
presents once again the aggressive and biased American position against
the Arab and Islamic peoples. It also proves that the American administration
relates to the people of this nation with the logic of the laws of the
jungle, not with the logic of justice and human rights.

<P>This aggression which comes together with the 29th Anniversary of the
crime of setting fire to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, emphasizes the American-Zionist
persecution of our Arab Islamic nation. This is a clear attempt of the
American president Bill Clinton to cover up his moral scandals and distract
people from the internal crisis he is facing.

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, which stands in the front line
of the forces struggling against the Zionist occupation, which is entirely
backed by the USA, declares its solidarity with the Sudanese and Afghan
people in confronting this aggression. It views this as an aggression against
every Palestinian, Arab and Muslim. Hamas calls on the governments and
the peoples of this nation to confront this continuous American-Zionist
aggression with all their power and determination.
