<p><center><h2>Rockets Fired at U.S. and U.N. Offices in Islamabad</h2></center>
<p><p>Six rockets were fired from improvised launchers at American and United
Nations offices in Islamabad. The rockets were all fired within a few minutes
of each other at around 11:15 this morning. Several of the rockets caught
fire upon smashing into cars, leading to earlier reports that the explosions
were the result of car bombings.
<p>One of the rockets hit a metal fence around the U.S. Information Services
cultural center, known as the American Center. A Pakistani guard standing
nearby&nbsp; was lightly injured by shrapnel. So far his was the only injury
confirmed, though there were reports that at least three others were injured
by flying glass and metal.
<p><b>Rockets were fired from vehicles near targets</b>
<br>Pakistani security officials said that six rockets were believed to
have been fired from vehicles in three different locations but that
only four of the rockets had been accounted for. The vehicles used in
the attack were believed to have been equipped with twin-barrel rocket
launchers.
<p>Although no one has taken responsibility for the attacks, both the timing
and the intended targets leave little doubt that the attacks were connected
to the imminent impositions of sanctions against the Taliban for refusing
to hand over Osama bin Ladin. The rocket attacks come only two days before
U.N. sanctions are due to take affect.
<p><b>"You will be surprised at what is coming to you"</b>
<br>Earlier this week Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, warned of "surprises"
if the U.N. resolution calling for the economic sanctions was carried out.
In the letter, which was addressed to the "people of the United States"
Omar said, "I call upon the people of the United States of America to bring
pressure on their government and ask them to cease hostility with us. If
you do not take a step (in) this direction (then) you will be surprised
about what is coming to you and you will not be able to do anything about
it."
<p>The threat of sanctions has already sparked widespread protest in Afghanistan
and in Pakistan. On Wednesday angry demonstrators, who were holding a rally
against the United Nations and United States stormed the UN office in Kandahar,
causing damage to the building but no injuries. Official estimates are
that over 50,000 people turned out for the protest rally. The protesters
burned U.S. flags and effigies of President Bill Clinton before attacking
the United Nations offices with stones and bottles.
