<p><center><h2>PKK Leadership Announces an End to the War with Turkey</h2></center>
<p>
<p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced a formal end to its
war against the Turkish government. In a statement faxed to news agencies
today, the PKK's said its ruling Congress "has confirmed the decision of
our party leader to stop the armed struggle." The Congress brought together
senior PKK commanders in January for 20 days of consultation. The meeting
is thought to have been held at a secret PKK base in Iran.
<p><b>PKK Congress backs Ocalan</b>
<br>From his prison cell on Imrali Island, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan had
earlier called on his organization to cease its armed struggle
against the Turkish government. He said that the violence had not brought
the Kurds any closer to realizing their dream of a separate homeland.
<p>The PKK has suffered overwhelming military setbacks as well as the arrest
last year of Ocalan. Making a virtue of necessity, the organization has followed a policy of increasing
politicization in recent years. "The resolution of the Kurdish question
within the framework of peace and democratization. ... will mean the pavement
of the path of peaceful and democratic unity in the Middle East," today's
statement said.
<p><b>From terrorist organization to political party</b>
<br>Today's statement hinted that the cessation of its military activities
would clear the way for negotiations with the Turkish government on a political
basis. The Turkish government has thus far refused
to negotiate with the PKK on grounds that it was a terrorist organization.
"The democratic political struggle has been adopted to be applied in all
arenas as the basic form of struggle."
<p>Today's announcement follows an earlier PKK decision to withdraw its fighters from Turkish soil. On 2 September,
1999 Abdullah Ocalan's brother Osman Ocalan, a military commander in the
PKK announced that the PKK was disarming for good. "We are laying down
our weapons, never to take them up again," he said in a statement broadcast live
by the pro-Kurdish satellite channel Medya-TV. "We will never fight again."
Osman Ocalan is a military commander in the PKK, and claimed to be
speaking on behalf of the organization's leadership council, of which he
is a member.
<p><b>Political changes</b>
<br>In its statement, the PKK said that its political wing, the Kurdistan
National Salvation Front, will be replaced by the Democratic People's Union
and its armed wing, the Kurdistan People's Salvation Army, will be called
the People's Defense Force. The military and political wings were
to be reorganized to reflect the transformation of the group into a political
party.
<p>In a major symbolic move the PKK said that the word "Kurdistan" would
be dropped from the names of new organizational subdivisions. This step
is seen as a clear concession to Turkey, which has made it a crime to use
the term "Kurdistan" within Turkish borders. In addition, the organization's
logo, a hammer and sickle within a Soviet-style star was to be replaced
with a new logo with a burning torch replacing the hammer and sickle.
<p>The PKK congress also called for an end to the conflict with a rival
Kurdish party, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in northern Iraq.
<p><b>Splits in the PKK becoming evident</b>
<br>Since Ocalan's initial call for a ceasefire, there have been signs
of a widening rift in the organization's leadership between militant hard-liners
and supporters of increased politicization of the PKK. These splits were
reflected in the decision announced in the PKK statement to disown a group
of PKK militants who refuse to lay down their arms. The renegades have
been involved in skirmishes with Turkish forces over the past year in Turkey's
eastern Tunceli province.
<p>The PKK said, however, that its peace overtures were "inseparable" from
the fate of Ocalan, a veiled warning that a backlash could occur should
the death sentence against the PKK leader be carried out.
