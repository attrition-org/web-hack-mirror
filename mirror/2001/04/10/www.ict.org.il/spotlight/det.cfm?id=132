<p><center><h2>Dar es Sala'am Bomb may not have been on Water Truck</h2></center>
<p>
<P>The New York Times reported on Thursday that initial theories concerning
the Dar es Sala'am bombing may have been mistaken. It was thought that
the bomb had been attacked to the embassy water truck.&nbsp; The truck,
which daily brought clean water to the embassy staff, was apparently awaiting
clearance to enter the embassy grounds when the bomb went off.

<P>The explosion left a crater 3 meters wide just behind the water truck,
investigators now believe. The remains of the water truck were swept forward
agianst the embasssy wall, suggesting that the bomb was not attached to
the truck&nbsp; The undercarriage of the vehicle seems to have suffered
far less damage than would have been suspected had the bomb been attached
to the truck.

<P>However, the investigators have so far found no evidence of a second
vehicle that could have been used to carry the bomb.&nbsp; Nor were there
eyewitness accounts of any other vehicles near the embassy gates at the
time of the blast.

<P>Meanwhile, the assistant to the driver of the water tanker Saidi Rogati,
remains missing. American officials said no trace of Rogati, who had worked
at the embassy for 13 years, had been found.&nbsp; The body of the driver
of the tanker had been found at the site.&nbsp; According to the <I>New
York Times</I> report, co-workers had seen him on the embassy grounds before
the explosion. Embassy officials assumed that he died in the blast, and
have strongly suggested that he was not a suspect.
