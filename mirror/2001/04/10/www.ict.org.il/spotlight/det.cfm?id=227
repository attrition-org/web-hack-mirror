<p><center><h2>Taliban Insists that Osama bin Ladin has Disappeared</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Afghanistan's Taliban militia is insisting that its controversial "guest,"
Osama bin Ladin has disappeared. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters news
agency that the Taliban had no idea where bin Ladin had gone, but that
he had not been forced to leave. "We still don't know anything about his
whereabouts, but we have never told him to leave."
<p>Bin Ladin's disappearance comes less than a week after the United States
reiterated its calls for the Taliban to extradite him to face trial in
the U.S. for his part in the U.S. embassy bombings last August. Last week,
President Clinton's special adviser on Terrorism, Richard Clarke affirmed
the right of the United States to take military action against nations
that willingly provided safe haven for known terrorists. Many see this
announcement as being directed specifically at the Taliban.
<p>The Taliban again rejected the American demands to extradite or expel
bin Ladin, who is regarded as a hero by many in the Arab world. In an apparent
effort to appease the United States, the militia announced last Wednesday
that bin Ladin's communication equipment had been confiscated, and that
he was under constant surveillance. The U.S. State Department dismissed
these restrictions as meaningless.
<p><b>No forwarding address</b>
<br>Osama bin Ladin's current whereabouts are unknown, though there has
been no lack of speculation in the media. The exiled Saudi dissident was
last reported to be living under heavy guard in the Taliban's spiritual
capital of Kandahar. The militia offered no comment as to how bin Ladin
managed to evade the surveillance team that was supposedly monitoring his
movements, nor on what means he had used to leave the areas under the militia's
control.
<p>Conditions in the region are such that it would not have been difficult
for a small group to slip across any of Afghanistan's territorial borders.
The nearest border is with Pakistan, but Afghanistan also shares a border
with Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China.
<p>However, the most likely candidate for asylum according to the media
is Iraq. This follows reports that a former Iraqi official was seen in
Kandahar recently.&nbsp; A report in London's <i>Guardian</i> claimed that
bin Laden had contacts with the Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, Faruq Hijazi,
in the mountains near Kandahar.
<p>Meanwhile, Iran, responded to reports that bin Ladin had been seen in
the vicinity of the Afghan-Iranian border.&nbsp; An official statement
from the Iranian foreign ministry said, "this information is unfortunate
and irresponsible, aimed at confusing public opinion."
<p>The Taliban's ambassador in Islamabad, Sayyed ur-Rahman Haqani, said
he had not been told of bin Ladin's departure, “but if it has happened,
it will be a good thing.”&nbsp; The departure of bin Ladin from Afghanistan
would prove convenient for the Taliban. The arch-terrorist's presence in
Afghanistan had been one of the major stumbling blocks to international
recognition for the movement as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.
However the Taliban could not risk asking him to leave, and thus angering
the movement's own supporters who see bin Ladin as a hero.
<p><b>"Nothing but gossip"</b>
<br>However, there is as yet no proof that bin Ladin has indeed left the
country. State Department Spokesman James Rubin told reporters that the
U.S. was not in a position "to confirm reports that bin Ladin has left
Afghanistan." British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Derrick Fatchet
said that he did not think it likely that the Taliban had lost track of
bin Laden.
<p>Two Arabic newspapers, <I>al-Quds</I> and <I>al-Hayyat</I>, reported that bin Ladin
had left Kandahar because of a "difference of opinion" with Taliban supreme
ruler Mullah Mohammad Omar. <I>Al-Hayyat</I> said that he left the city with about
ten others, including his military commander Mohammed Atef, the head of
the&nbsp; Islamic Jihad group in Egypt Ayman Zawahri, and Mohammed Shawqi
Islambouli, a leader of the Egyptian Gama'a al-Islamiya
(Islamic Group). Sources close to bin Ladin reportedly said he had moved
north to areas controlled by commanders of former Prime Minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami who recently joined the Taliban.
<p>Some sources close to the Taliban also deny that bin Ladin has left
Afghanistan. Maulana Samiul Haq, head of a faction of the Jamiatul Ulema-i-Islami
party, told Reuters, "all this talk of his having gone missing is nothing
but&nbsp; mere gossip." Haq, whose schools train Islamic militants for
"Jihad," feels that bin Ladin would not have left Afghanistan of his own
will, and that the Taliban would never have asked him to leave. "I think
it would be advisable for Osama to go underground.&nbsp; He is the asset
and honor and pride of Islam," he said.
