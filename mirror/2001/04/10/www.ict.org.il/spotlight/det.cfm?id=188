<p><center><h2>Muslim Brotherhood Accuses Palestinian Authority
of Assassination Plots

</h2></center>
<p><BR><I>Accusation points up links between Hamas and the Jordanian Brotherhood</i>
<P>Information and Commentary by Reuven Paz, ICT Academic Director

<P>The 19 November 1998 edition of the Jordanian weekly, <I>Al-Saheel</I>,
the organ of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, claims that the Palestinian
Authority is plotting to assassinate religious figures in Jordan.

<P>Salem Al-Falahat, a senior member in the executive office of the Jordanian
Muslim Brotherhood says that his organization has information concerning
the intention of certain security apparatuses within the PA to assassinate
several important personalities in Jordan. He claims that these key figures
have been targeted because they are the highest source <I>(Marja段yyah)
</I>of religious rulings <I>(Fatwah)</I> and have great influence on public
opinion regarding the Wye Plantation Accord.

<P>Al-Falahat identified Dr. Hamam Sa段d, deputy secretary general of the
Islamic Labor Front political party, as the chief target of the PA strike.
He added that the General Inspector <I>(Al-Muraqih Al-羨am)</I> of the
Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood warned the Jordanian authorities about these
threats, and was informed that the Jordanian government knew of these intentions
and "has taken the necessary steps." Al-Falahat announced that the Muslim
Brotherhood has taken precautions to preclude any PA action, and that the
movement is taking these unprecedented threats very seriously. He described
the PA scheme as "the fruit of its accords with the enemy and one of the
appendices of the contemptuous security accords signed at Wye Plantation."

<P>Al-Falahat denied any existence of a religious ruling by Dr. Hamam Sa段d,
which allegedly sanctioned the killing of PA leaders. Dr. Sa段d has also
denied these allegations, stating his concern for preventing a civil war
within the Palestinian people. Sa段d claimed that these false accusations
are an attempt to silence those voicing their opposition to peace accords
with the enemy.

<P>Media sources reported that the Jordanian authorities have warned the
PA not to carry out any assassinations on Jordanian soil. Dr. Sa段d told
<I>Al-Sabeel</I> that "there were talks held between the leadership of
the Muslim Brotherhood and the Jordanian government, and apparently the
government had this information and had warned the PA against any assassinations
on Jordanian soil." He went on to censure "the Jews whose hands are behind
these threats, in order to liquidate the active forces that empower the
people to confront the Jews." Sa段d added that he "was not the only the
target of these threats; the Wye Plantation Accord was meant to eliminate
what they call terrorism, and the accord would not exclude any of the activists
who favor the struggle against the Jewish existence."
