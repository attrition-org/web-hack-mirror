<p><center><h2>Investigation into Embassy Bombings gets Underway</h2></center>
<p>
<P>As hope fades of finding anyone left alive beneath the rubble, the search
to find the perpetrators gets underway. Rescue workers are still working
feverishly against the clock to free the few survivors still believed to
be alive as of Monday afternoon. However, increasingly rescue work is being
superceded by detective work.

<P>The American government has made it clear that no effort will be spared
in tracking down and bringing to justice those responsible for Friday's
bombings. Already, more than 100 U.S. investigators are hard at work at
the two bombing sites, sifting the debris and sordid remains of the embassies
and surrounding buildings in search of clues.

<P><B>The search for "fingerprints"</B>
<BR>Of foremost importance, according to the FBI investigation team, is
to determine the nature of the explosives used. The importance of such
a determination was explained by Israeli security analysts: If the explosives
were constructed of easily acquired materials, such as fertilizers,
then the bombs could have been made locally. However, the presence of more
complicated materials, such as RDX or Semtex would indicate an operation
of a much higher order of sophistication.

<P>RDX is a standard explosive, in use by government and private factories
for making explosives. Semtex is a plastic explosive that gained notoriety
in the 1980's, when it was a favorite of international terrorist organizations.
The presence of this type of explosive could indicate the involvement of
a state, or at least of an organization with very complex international
connections.

<P>This level of devastation would require a colossal amount of homemade
explosives of the kind used in the Oklahoma City bombing. However, the
much smaller quantity of standard explosives needed to produce the same
effect could have been smuggled across the borders from the neighboring
countries of Sudan, Ethiopia or Somalia.

<P><B>The Nairobi Bombing - conflicting accounts</B>

<br>The investigators initially have very little to go on--those who might
have been close enough to give reliable eyewitness accounts must have all
been killed in the blasts. The known facts in both bombings are few. In
Nairobi, what is known is that the explosion occurred near the rear entrance
to the embassy. A high-level embassy official told reporters that the vehicle
was first driven to the embassy's main entrance. There, the Kenyan guards,
who did not recognize the vehicle, directed it around to the delivery entrance at
the back of the embassy.

<P>After passing through a manually operated gate at the edge of the ramp
leading to the embassy's underground parking garage, the explosives-laden
vehicle approached to within a few meters of the wall of the embassy. What
happened next is unclear. According to an embassy official, at least one
of the Kenyan guards at the embassy gate was killed by grenades hurled
by the terrorists. Other witnesses said that they heard the sound of
gunfire shortly before the blast.

<P>The local daily <I>Nation</I> quoted a witness as saying he saw two men drive
a yellow pickup truck to the back of the embassy and jump out brandishing
machine guns. "One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy," he said.

<P>What is certain is that those in the immediate vicinity were buried
beneath tons of cement and steel as the five-story Ufundi building collapsed
on top of them. The blast blew out windows 10 blocks away, including the
supposedly bomb-proof windows of the embassy. According to some explosives
experts, the force of the blast was equal to that of over 500 pounds of
TNT.  The embassy building was damaged far less than the buildings around it, due to its bomb-proof construction.  The structure, which once served as the Israeli embassy, was built by an Israeli company according to rigid security standards.

<P>From the size and shape of the bomb crater, the type of vehicle, and
traces of chemicals left behind at the scene, investigators hope to come
up with an analysis of the type of explosives used. This analysis will
be only the first step on the long road to finding out who built, transported
and detonated the bombs.

<P><B>The Dar es Salaam Bombing - a video camera and a water truck</B>

<br>While the search in Nairobi concentrates mostly on the rescue efforts,
 presenting few clues to investigators, the bombing site in Tanzania would
seem to offer the best hope of finding direct evidence of events leading
up to the bombing. A video camera located on the roof of the Embassy seemed
to be intact--and was still pointing directly at the guardhouse near which
the bomb exploded. American officials pointed out that the security camera's
images are not always recorded, but are observed in real-time. However,
there is some chance that the camera survived the blast intact and recorded
the bombing itself.

<P>If the prevailing theories are correct, the Dar es Salaam bomb was hidden
on a water truck owned by the embassy. The truck made a daily run from
an embassy-owned well to the embassy to provide clean drinking water to
the staff. The driver of the vehicle was well known at the embassy and
would have been admitted into the embassy grounds with very little question.

<P>However, there is some speculation that the vehicle raised some suspicion
on the part of the local guards at the gate, and that they may have actually
been investigating the tanker when the bomb went off. The truck was within
meters of the building on detonation. The remains of the water truck would
seem to indicate that it was awaiting entry clearance when it exploded.
One of the questions that will need to be answered concerns how the bomb
came to be attacked to the embassy-owned tanker.

<P><B>The need for intelligence</B>

<br>Though it is clear that the physical evidence from both sites is of
the utmost importance in unraveling the chain of events that led to the
two bombings, it is equally clear that much work will need to be done
on a less visible front--that of international intelligence. The on-scene
investigation, now in its first stages, will undoubtedly be only a first
step in an inquiry spanning continents and cultures. If present speculation
as to the identity of the bombers is correct, then a major effort of intelligence--particularly human intelligence, which some say the Americans have largely neglected in recent years--will be required in order to bring
those responsible to justice.<p><b>Sources: </>Ha'aretz, the Nation</I></b>
