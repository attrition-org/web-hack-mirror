<p><center><h2>Extradition of Alleged bin Ladin Associate to U.S.  Upheld</h2></center>
<p><p>Britain's High Court rejected a bid by Khaled al-Fawaz, a suspected
member of Osama bin Ladin's al-Qaidah network, against his extradition
to the United States.
<p><b>Request for extradition based on American indictment</b>
<br>Al-Fawaz was indicted by a U.S. grand jury for his part in the bombings
of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998. The American court
papers accuse al-Fawaz of conspiring with bin Ladin and others, between
1993 and 1998, to murder American citizens. He has been held since September
1998, pending the outcome of the extradition proceedings.
<p>In handing down the ruling, Lord Justice Buxton said, "the evidence
points sufficiently strongly to Mr. Al-Fawaz's involvement in the conspiracy..."
However, al Fawaz' lawyer, Akhtar Raja, said that he would appeal the verdict
to the House of Lords.
<p><b>Suspect is reportedly bin Ladin's primary British contact</b>
<br>Al-Fawaz, in his 30's, is the former head of the London-based "Advice
and Reformation Committee" (ARC), created in 1994 as a support group for
Islamists in Britain. The group was the primary channel for the distribution
of bin Ladin's fatwas and calls for Jihad.
<p>In the past, al-Fawaz described himself as an old friend of Osama Bin
Ladin, whom he called "a wise and a kind man." Although, al-Fawaz has been
at pains to distance himself from bin Ladin's calls for holy war, he is
widely recognized as bin Ladin's primary contact in Britain.
<p>Britain at present hosts some 400 Islamic organizations, some of which
are now under investigation as being front groups for terrorist groups.<font color="#990000"></font><font color="#990000"></font>
<p><b>More suspects to be tried in U.S. next month</b>
<br>Al-Fawaz is one of 17 people indicted in the United States in connection
with the embassy bombings. One of the 17, Ali Mohammed, a former U.S. Army
sergeant, pleaded guilty at the end of October to helping to plot the embassy
bombings and participating in a terrorist conspiracy against Americans.
Five other suspects are due to appear in a U.S. court on 3 January, 2001.
<p>The U.S. filed extradition requests for three suspects detained in Britain,
including al-Fawaz. Eight additional suspects, including bin Ladin himself,
remain at large. The U.S. government has offered a $5 million reward for
the capture of each of the eight fugitives.
