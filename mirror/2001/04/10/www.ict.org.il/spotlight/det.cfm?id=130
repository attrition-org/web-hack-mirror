<p><center><h2>Sheikh Yassin statement on Terrorism outside of
Israel</h2></center>
<p>

<P>On 11<SUP>th</SUP> August 1998, in a statement quoted on Hamas’ official
internet site, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin claimed to have no knowledge of the
identity of those responsible for the bombings of the American embassies
in Nairobi and Dar al-Salaam. However, Yassin justified the explosions
as being waged in the framework of self-defense. “The USA,” he said, “has
placed itself on the side of the Jewish state against the Arab and Islamic
world, therefore it comes as no surprise to see people who wish to take
revenge for the unjust American policy.” Yassin regarded the explosions
in Africa as “the self-defense of those who sought to avenge the damage
caused by the American policy in their countries.” He emphasized that Hamas
had neither information concerning the people responsible for the attacks
nor their relations with Ossama Bin Ladin.

<P>Yassin also attacked the American investigators: “the American intelligence
people are mistaken in identifying their enemy.”

<P>In the course of his statement Yassin declared that “Hamas has no wish
to attack the USA. Our struggle is on the land of Palestine and we will
not move it outside of Palestine because it does not serve our cause and
our people.”

<P>Sheikh Yassin also declared also that “Hamas has carried out no attacks
on the Jewish State recently--not because of an ideological change--but
due to circumstances confronting Hamas warriors in the field. This is the
consequence of the common activity of the American and Israeli intelligence
and the Palestinian Authority against the activity of our sons”. He emphasized
that “Hamas has not thrown down its arms and is still devoted to the Jihad.”
