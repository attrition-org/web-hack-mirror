<P>The American strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan show that the Americans
have evidently solved the mystery of the bombings in Nairobi and Tanzania,
and have obtained ample evidence of Osama bin Ladin's involvement in the
attacks.&nbsp; The speed with which the Americans reacted reveals that
security forces have for some time been watching bin Ladin's people, as
well as carrying out reconnaissance on the specific sites of the bombings.&nbsp;
This type of attack requires the collection of extensive operational intelligence
over a long period of time, indicating that American intelligence was on
bin Ladin's trail long before the bombings of the American embassies.

<P>A number of factors required the American to act as soon as possible.&nbsp;
Among these are bin Ladin's reiteration of threats to attack American targets,
as well as the nature of the target attacked in Sudan--if the Shifa factory
was indeed engaged in the manufacture or storage of chemical weapons.&nbsp;
The natural response, and the quickest and most efficient, was to execute
an aerial attack, using either planes or cruise missiles.&nbsp; Such an
option allows the Americans to use to good advantage their technological
advantage to very quickly destroy or seriously damage the selected targets.

<P>The American strikes have accomplished several things at once. On the
one hand the attacks were a punitive response to bin Ladin's role in the
bombings in east Africa; on the other hand, the strikes serve to disrupt
bin Ladin's networks, and deter them from future involvement in terrorist
activity.&nbsp; Another message in America's hitting these particular targets
is directed at those nations that support terrorists; nations that allow
terrorist organizations to use their soil as a base from which to launch
terror attacks. The Americans are in effect saying to such nations, "be
aware that we are capable of striking back."&nbsp; But above all, the American
strikes should be seen as pre-emptive attacks, aimed at forestalling the
terrorists from carrying out their threats to again attack American targets.
