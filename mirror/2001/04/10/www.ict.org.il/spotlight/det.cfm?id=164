<p><center><h2>Islamists Detained in England Allegedly Linked
to bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<P>In a joint action between anti-terrorist police officers from Special
Branch and MI5, British police arrested seven men thought to be linked
to Osama bin Ladin's international terrorist network.&nbsp; The seven,
described by the BBC as "of Middle Eastern origin," were arrested at separate
locations in north-west and west London early on Wednesday morning. A business
address was also searched.

<P>Among those arrested, according to a Reuters report, are Khaled al Fawaz,
the London representative of the Saudi dissident "Advice and Reform Committee,"
and Adel Abdul Magid Abdul-Bari, an Egyptian. Five other Egyptians were
also arrested.&nbsp; The detainees were named by Bakri Mohammed, a spokesman
for the Muhajiroun Islamist group, as Hani al-Sibai, Abdul-Mageed Fahmi,
Abu Mussab As-Souri, Ahmed Abdel Maqssoud, and Sajed Ajami.

<P>Al Fawaz has described&nbsp; himself in recent interviews as an old
friend of Osama Bin Ladin, whom he called "a wise and a kind man."&nbsp;
However, he took care to distance himself from bin Ladin's calls for holy
war. Abdul-Bari was sentenced to death in absentia in Egypt for plotting
to blow up a Cairo bazaar.

<P>A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard was quoted by the BBC as saying
that all the suspects "are being interviewed. There were no shots fired,
no armed officers involved."&nbsp; Under British law, the suspects can
legally be questioned for up to four days without charge. Scotland Yard claimed that
the arrests had nothing to do with new laws making planning terrorist acts
abroad a punishable offense in Britain. Rather, the arrests took place
under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989.

<P>Whether or not they served as the basis for the current arrests, the
new laws insure that extremist groups will find it much harder to find
safe-haven in England than in the past.&nbsp; Britain at present hosts
some 400 <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_158000/158410.stm">Islamic
organizations</A>, some of which are now under investigation as being front
groups for terrorist groups.
