<p><center><h2>UN Sanctions against Taliban go into Effect</h2></center>
<p>
<p>A UN Security Council resolution imposing travel and economic sanction on Afhanistan's Taliban militia goes into effect today. The resolution calls for the Taliban to hand over terrorism suspect Osama bin Ladin or face geographical and financial isolation. The resolution passed unanimously
on October 15. The <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19991015.sc6739.doc.html" target="_new">resolution</a>,
which was drafted by the United States, freezes the Taliban's overseas
assets and bans flights owned, leased or operated by the Taliban from taking
off or landing internationally.
<p><b>Taliban still refuses to hand over bin Ladin</b>
<br>The Security Council demanded that the Islamist faction hand over bin
Ladin "without further delay to a country where he has been indicted" or
"to appropriate authorities in a country where he will be arrested and
effectively brought to justice." The exiled Saudi billionaire was indicted
in the United States for the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in August 1998.
<p>The U.S. has tried repeatedly to persuade the Taliban to extradite bin
Laden to the United States, or to a third country to stand trial for his
role in the August 1998 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Taliban has refused. Bin Ladin now enjoys the dubious fame of appearing
on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list, with a $5 million price on his head. There
are indications that he may be in financial troubles, after his assets
abroad were frozen by the several western countries. It is unknown how
much capital he has tied up in anonymous accounts and "cover" companies.
<p><b>Sanctions could effectively isolate Taliban</b>
<br>Under the terms of the sanctions UN member states will be required
to "deny permission for any aircraft to take off from or land in their
territory if it is owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of the Taliban."
States are also required to "freeze funds and other financial resources,
including funds generated from property owned or controlled directly by
the Taliban."&nbsp; Exemptions to the flight ban include flights for humanitarian
reasons or to allow Afghan citizens to perform the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.
<p>More sweeping sanctions against the Taliban were imposed by the United
States earlier this year. On July 4 President Clinton signed an <a href="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=26">executive
order</a> prohibiting trade or transactions with the Taliban or in territory
controlled by the Taliban, thus preventing any U.S. investment in Afghanistan.
It also freezes any Taliban-owned assets within U.S. jurisdiction and allowed
for the seizure of the Afghanistan airline's $500 million in U.S. assets.
<p><b>Imposition of sanctions sparks widespread protests</b>
<br>Taliban supporters have taken to the streets in protest of the sanctions,
burning American flags and effigies of U.S. President Bill Clinton. In
Kabul protesters attacked the UN World Food Program building with bottles
and stones. In Pakistan too there have been protests, sponsored by Islamic
religious organizations that identity with the interests of the Taliban.
Afghanistan's Taliban and its adherents are regarded by many Pakistanis
as Islamic heroes.
<p>On Friday homemade rockets were fired at American and United Nations
interests in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan. Although no one has taken
responsibility for the attacks, both the timing and the intended targets
leave little doubt that the attacks were connected to the imminent impositions
of sanctions against the Taliban.
<p>Last week Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, warned of "surprises"
if the U.N. resolution calling for the economic sanctions was carried out.
In the letter, which was addressed to the "people of the United States"
Omar said, "I call upon the people of the United States of America to bring
pressure on their government and ask them to cease hostility with us. If
you do not take a step (in) this direction (then) you will be surprised
about what is coming to you and you will not be able to do anything about
it."
