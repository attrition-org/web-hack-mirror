<p><center><h2>Jordanians Arrest Fugitive Linked to bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<p>A Jordanian fugitive allegedly linked to Saudi militant Osama bin Ladin
was arrested in Amman on Tuesday. Jamal Tahrawi, a Jordanian of Palestinian
descent was detained on charges of planning terrorist attacks.
<p>His arrest brings to 16 the number of Arab suspects currently in police
detention for allegedly plotting to attack American and Israeli tourists
in Jordan during New Year's celebrations.
<p><b>Trial enters second month</b>
<br>A total of 28 suspects are currently on trial for the terror plot.
They have been charged with possession of explosives and affiliation with
"an outlawed group" involved in a "conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks"
in Jordan and carrying out robberies to finance their activities. The group
reportedly planned attacks on Mount Nebo and a Christian settlement along
the Jordan River said to be the site where Jesus was baptized.
<p>Fifteen suspects, including 13 Jordanians of Palestinian origin, an
Iraqi and an Algerian were arrested in December of last year. Another 12
are being tried <i>in absentia</i>. Those still at large are thought to
be in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Britain, Lebanon and Syria. The Jordanian
government has begun extradition proceedings for some of the suspects.
<p><b>False passports, explosives and maps of tourist sites</b>
<br>Since the trial began on 20 April, witnesses have testified that the
defendants had stockpiled weapons, ammunition, acid and detonators to use
in bombing attacks. Police officers earlier this week testified that sketches
of Jordanian tourist hotels and addresses of Jewish diplomats were found
in the possession of some of the suspects.
<p>Jordanian officials identified the leader of the group as Khader Abu
Ghoshah. In 1993 Abu Ghoshah was sentence to a jail term in Jordan for
several bombings. One of the officers testifying against Ghoshah said that
the address of a woman diplomat with the Israeli embassy in Amman was found
in his possession along with sketches of tourist hotels in Amman and of
military and official buildings.
<p>Three other police officers testified on Monday that a search of the
homes of six of the suspects turned up counterfeit U.S., French, Dutch,
Iraqi and Jordanian passports, as well as fake Amman airport customs stamps
and fake stamps of the Syrian interior and foreign ministries, Aleppo University
in northern Syria and others of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
<p><b>Instructions to the cell came from Osama bin Ladin</b>
<br>Jordanian Prosecutor General Lieutenant General Mahmoud Obeidat called
the cell was "the most dangerous terrorist group ever uncovered in Jordan."
He said that instructions to the cell were relayed by Zein Al Abiddeen
Hassan, an Egyptian national currently living in in Pakistan. "Zein Al
Abiddeen Hassan is the representative of Osama bin Ladin and one of the
senior officials of al-Qaidah organization."
<p>One of those on trial <i>in absentia</i> at large is Omar Mahmoud Abu
Omar, a Muslim fundamentalist residing in Britain, who, according to the
indictment provided most of the funding for the cell. Abu Omar is well
known to Jordanian security forces. In 1998 he was sentenced in absentia
for his part in a series of bomb blasts in Amman at the beginning of 1998,
one of which targeted the former official of Jordanian military intelligence.
