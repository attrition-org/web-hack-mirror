<p><center><h2>Ramzi Yousef Gets 240 Years</h2></center>
<p><P>Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the terrorist convicted of masterminding and helping to carry out the deadly 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was sentenced in New York to 240 years in prison with the highly unusual recommendation from the judge that he be kept in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.

<P>In the bombing on February ’93 six people were killed and a thousand injured.
Ramzi Yousef , 29 year old Pakistani (?), is considered to be one of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, and in the view of FBI investigators, he was involved in the planning of many terror acts in different countries.

<P>Yousef belongs to a group of militant Muslims who planned numerous terrorist acts “to punish” the United States. Ramzi Yousef escaped the United States several hours after the explosion in the parking lot of one of the two towers. He was trapped in 1995 in Pakistan and was extradited to the United States.

<P>Yousef was also sentenced today to another life term for a 1994 plot  to plant bombs abroad 12 U.S. airliners operating in the far east and for exploding a bomb abroad a 
Philippine airliner as a trail run, killing one passenger.

<P>Prosecutors also unsealed an indictment today against Khaled Shaikh Mohammad for participating in the plot to bomb U.S. airlines. He is believed to be a relative of Yousef, who has operated under a number of different names.

<P>Six Muslim immigrants, among them the blind Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdid el Rahman who were convicted two years ago as accomplices in the World Trade center bombing are now serving life imprisonment sentences.
