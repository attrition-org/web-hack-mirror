<p><center><h2>Trial of Islamic Militants Opens in France</h2></center>
<p><p>The trial of more than 20 people accused of aiding Islamic militants
opened on Wednesday in a Paris courthouse. The defendants face charges
of providing false documents, funding and recruitment for armed Islamists.
<p>Among the accused was Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian accused of plotting
to carry out bombings in the U.S. during the Millennium celebrations. Ressam
is currently held in the United States, after being apprehended in December
1999 at the U.S.-Canadian border with a large quantity of explosives. He
is due to go on trial in Los Angeles on 12 March of this year. Ressam is
one of seven defendants being tried <i>in absentia </i>in Paris.
<p>Another of the suspects on trial is Fateh Kamel. French prosecutors
accuse Kamel of organizing a support network of Islamists, known at the
Roubaix gang. The group is thought to have provided logistic aid to Islamic
militants in France and abroad. Kamel is believed to be linked to Osama
bin Ladin and his al-Qaida network. He has been held in France since April
of this year.
