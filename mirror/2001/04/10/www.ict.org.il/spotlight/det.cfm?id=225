<p><center><h2>United States Raising the Stakes for Sponsoring
Terrorism</h2></center>
<p>
<p>In what many see as a departure from its former tactics, the United
States is now asserting that it could, in certain circumstances, take military
action against government facilities in countries that provide safe haven
to terrorists.
<p>In an interview with the Associated Press, Richard Clarke, President
Clinton's coordinator for counter-terrorism outlined the administration's
strategy. Clarke said that the U.S. could bomb government facilities or
civilian infrastructure in countries that knowingly harbor terrorists.
The State Department was careful to distinguish between countries fighting
an internal terrorist presence; and countries--such as Sudan and Afghanistan--that
willingly give safe haven to terrorists and defy international efforts
to bring terrorists to justice.
<p><b>New policy is merely increased enforcement of older doctrine</b>
<br>This marks a departure in application rather than in doctrine, as the
Clinton administration has repeatedly warned countries that sponsor terrorism
that they are not exempt from punitive measures. The U.S. demonstrated
that these were not just idle words when, on August 20, 1998, it lauched
cruise missiles at sites linked to Saudi militant Osama bin Ladin in Sudan
and Afghanistan.
<p>However, those attacks deliberately refrained from targeting the host
countries' official installations. They were selective strikes against
 sites having no direct connection with the ruling regime.&nbsp;
In the past, the U.S. carried out military strikes on official installations
belonging to countries known to be actively involved in terrorism. In 1986
the U.S. air force bombed targets in Libya following revelations that Tripoli
was behind Abu Nidal's attacks on American targets.
<p>Now, the U.S. is "upping the ante." A country that knowingly gives sanctuary
to terrorists--even if not directly involved in planning or executing terrorist
activity--could find itself looking down the bore of the American counter-terrorism
apparatus.
<p>This threat has particular relevance now, in light of the latest developments
in the bin Ladin case. Recently, the arrest of several of his operatives
has strengthened the evidence that he may be planning further attacks on
American targets. However, the Taliban has once more reasserted that it
has no intention of surrendering bin Ladin to face charges, whether in
the U.S. or elsewhere.
<p><b>Taliban may be the first test of U.S. policies</b>
<br>Last week senior Taliban militia members met to consider whether to
honor an American request to expel or extradite Osama bin Ladin. The meeting
followed contacts between Rick Inderfurth, a senior U.S. envoy, with a
Taliban delegation in Islamabad. Inderfurth reportedly sent a letter to
the militia's rulers urging them to extradite bin Ladin to either the U.S.
or Saudi Arabia, or at the very least, to expel him from Afghanistan.
<p>On Wednesday, Taliban spokesman Mullah Abdul Haye Mutmaen announced
that the militia had decided not to expel bin Laden. Mutmaen was quoted
by Reuters as saying that the Taliban viewed the American request as "irrational."
"Any move on these lines against Osama will cause a lot of resentment and
a chaotic situation among the Afghans and the whole Muslim world. No Muslim
or Afghan would accept the handing over of Osama."&nbsp; He added, "We
guarantee we will control his political and military activities."
<p>Although some may see the American announcement concerning countries
that harbor terrorists as directed in particular at Afghanistan, the issue
of military strikes on Taliban installations apparently was not raised
during the discussions with the Taliban on bin Ladin.
<p>However, there are signs that the Taliban is taking the implicit threat
seriously. Today the militia announced that the they were clamping down
on bin Ladin's activities. The statement claimed that bin Ladin was now
cut off from all communication with the outside world--his phone service
had been cut off and his meetings restricted. In addition, all of his comings
and goings will henceforth take place under the eyes of a "surveillance
group."
<p><b>Easier said than done</b>
<br>Afghanistan is not the only potential target for punitive strikes.
The American announcement could just as easily be applied to Libya. So
far Tripoli has resisted all international efforts to bring to justice
the two Libyan agents accused of bombing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie
in 1989.
<p>Whether the announcement was meant to be construed as directed toward
a particular country or not, what is certain is that putting the new policy
into effect could involve major complications. Not least of these is the
need for concrete proof that a country is willingly and knowingly providing
safe haven for terrorists. This issue runs up against a considerable obstacle
in the form of the "terrorist vs freedom fighter" argument. The majority
of states that presently willingly tolerate a terrorist presence in their
territory justify this on the grounds that they host "national liberation
movements" or "freedom fighters."&nbsp; In view of the current lack of
an accepted means of determining who is a terrorist, strikes against state
sponsors of terrorism will continue to rest on a shaky legal foundation.
<p>No less thorny are the moral issues. Targeting a country's government
facilities could lead to high civilian casualties, entailing grave moral
and political implications. This holds true even more for strikes against
civilian infrastructure such as power plants or dams.
<p>On the other hand, countries that harbor terrorists and their infrastructure
cannot say they have not been warned.
