<p><center><h2>U.S. Temporarily Closes Six Embassies in Africa</h2></center>
<p><P>The United States has ordered six of its embassies in Africa temporarily
closed, citing "concrete information" that a terrorist attack may be in
the works. State Department Spokesman James Rubin said that the closures were 
based on information that some of the embassies had been under surveillance by
suspicious individuals.

<P>The embassies in question are those in Namibia, Senegal, Madagascar,
Liberia, Togo and Gambia. Security at other U.S. embassies has been tightened
since the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last August. In many countries
the embassies have been closed repeatedly due to security concerns.

<P><B>Threats increasing both in quantity and quality</B>
<BR>"In recent weeks the State Service has received a number of threats
against US embassies in those countries, so we have decided for the safety
of American and other citizens in those areas to close them for the moment,"
an official at the US embassy in Pretoria told the AFP.

<P>Although the State Department doesn't as a rule reveal its reasons for
security precautions, the name behind the recent threats is almost certainly
that of Osama bin Ladin. The millionaire-terrorist, accused of orchestrating
last years bombings in Dar-es-Sala'am and Nairobi, and financing a number of
other attacks on American interests is once more in the news. 
Last week ABC News quoted American officials as saying that
there was increasing evidence that bin Ladin's network was preparing to
strike again.

<P>An intelligence source quoted by Reuters said,
"there are some new indications that he may be reaching
the point of possibly conducting a terrorist attack somewhere." He added,
"the same thing could have been said at several points over the last six
months, but there are  indications that he and his associates might
be close to conducting such an attack."

<P><B>Part of a pattern?</B>
<BR>According to ABCNews, the evidence that an attack may
be in the works includes intercepted phone conversations in which bin Ladin's
operatives discussed the transferal of explosives and personnel.

<P>ABC said that the U.S. Embassy in Mozambique was videotaped
from a parked car last month. The car sped away when police approached
to investigate. Several other embassies in Africa--notably in Ghana and
Senegal--have also reportedly been under observation by unknown elements.

<P>Bin Ladin's televised interview on Qatar's al-Jazeera
satellite would also seem to fit the pattern. In the past bin Ladin has
been particularly outspoken just before attempting a terrorist operation.
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley was quoted by Reuters
as saying that American officials had been preparing for attacks on U.S.
installations around the world since August. "We have said all along that
Osama bin Laden would seek to attack U.S. interests around the world ...
and we fully believe he intends to do so if he can," he said.

<P><B>At least seven previous attacks foiled</B>
<BR>In February USA today reported that U.S. intelligence
services had thwarted at least seven attempted attacks by bin Ladin's network
on American installations. Citing unidentified senior intelligence
officials, the paper said attacks were foiled against the Prince Sultan
Air Base in Saudi Arabia, and against embassies in Albania, Azerbaijan,
Ivory Coast, Tajikistan, Uganda and Uruguay.

<P>American officials had said that two additional attacks were prevented,
this time against embassies which had been evacuated and closed due to
security threats.

<P>Intercepted phone calls proved crucial to foiling these attacks. American
intelligence agencies used a reconnaissance satellite to monitor calls
by members of bin Ladin's network, and tipped off local officials at the
proposed target. In a number of cases arrests were made in connection with
the planned attacks.
