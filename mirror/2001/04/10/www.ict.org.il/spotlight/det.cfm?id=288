<p><center><h2>PKK
Calls for a Halt to Revenge Attacks</h2></center>
<p><p>The Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) has called for an end to the wave of
revenge attacks in the wake of the sentencing of Kurdish leader Ocalan.
In a statement distributed by the German-based DEM Kurdish news agency,
the PKK, said "from now on and until another order is issued there will
be no sacrificial actions and efforts will be made to prevent attacks on
civilian targets."
<p>"We are of the opinion that the desired message of this magnificent
uprising has been delivered and sufficiently reached all people," the statement
said.
<p><b>PKK heeds Ocalan's calls to maintain order</b>
<br>The organization called on its members to "act with utmost prudence
so as not to harm our struggle during this sensitive period." The statement appears to be in response to a previous call
by Ocalan. The Kurdish leader asked his supporters not to engage in any
activities that might worsen his chances of escaping the death penalty
decreed against him by a Turkish court.
<p>Since his capture last February, Ocalan has been at pains to portray
himself as a peacemaker. Throughout his trial he offered to act as a restraining
influence on his organization if his life were spared. His appeal against
the death sentence is expected to last for months.
<p>PKK military commanders currently holed up in the mountains of eastern
Turkey and northern Iraq have so far backed Ocalan's peace overtures. However
there are signs of a widening rift in the organization's leadership between
militant hard-liners and supporters of increased "politicization" of the
PKK.
<p><b>Arrests made in latest bombings</b>
<br>On Tuesday, Turkish police arrested around 20 suspected Kurdish militants
accused of involvement in last week's park bomb that killed one person
and injured 25 others. Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir said that a significant
amount of explosives and bomb-making materials were found in caches disclosed
by the suspects during their interrogation.
<p>Ozdemir said two other suspects were arrested over a bomb explosion
in a minibus in Istanbul late Monday that left two people critically injured.
He said that four of the detainees were being trained to carry out suicide
attacks. The four were all women, a fact which ties in with the PKK tradition
of using mostly women as suicide bombers.
<p>Since the Ocalan verdict last month, PKK militants have attacked coffee-houses,
planted bombs in crowded streets and public places, and carried out suicide
attacks. The attacks have left at least 10 people dead and around 50 injured.
<p><b>PKK reserves right of "Active defense" against military targets</b>
<br>The statement issued by the PKK emphasized that the organization was
not calling for a cease-fire, but only a cessation of activity against
civilian targets.&nbsp; The rebels vowed to press on with their "active
defense" against the Turkish armed forces. Fighting continues between PKK
rebels and Turkish security forces in the mountains of eastern Turkey and
the Kurdish-held enclave of northern Iraq.
<p>Meanwhile, Turkey's parliament has extended by four months the state
of emergency rule in force in six southeastern provinces. The decision
was widely expected and provides emergency rule authorities with wide powers
to combat Ocalan's rebels active in the region.
