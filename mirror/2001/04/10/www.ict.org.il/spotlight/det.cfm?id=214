<p><center><h2>The Kidnapping in Yemen: the British Connection</h2></center>
<p>
<p>The kidnapping of 16 tourists in Yemen last month--and the diplomatic
crisis between Yemen and Britain surrounding the botched rescue of the
hostages--has become entangled with the arrest of five British nationals
in Yemen.
<p>The five Britons were identified as Shahid Butt, 33; Malik Nasser, 26;
Samad Ahmad, 21; Mohsin Ghalain, 18; and Ghulam Hussein, 25. They were
arrested last month on suspicion of involvement in a plot to bomb British
interests in Aden. The Yemeni government claimed that last month's kidnapping
was intended to try to secure the release of the five Britons.
<p>The leader of the kidnappers is currently on trial in Aden for his part
in the kidnapping, which cost the lives of four hostages--one Australian
and three Britons. The accused was identified as Zein al-Abidine al-Mehdar,
known as Abu al-Hassan al-Mehdar, 28. Abu Hassan and two others were captured
in the rescue in which the tourists were killed. If found guilty they face
the death penalty under Yemeni law, which views kidnapping as a capital
crime.
<p><b>The British connection</b>
<br>The issue of the five Britons under arrest in Aden came up in connection
with the kidnapping when Yemeni authorities claimed that the kidnappers
demanded the release of the five in exchange for the release of the western
hostages. The lawyer for the five Britons, Salim Basunaid, was quoted by
the London paper <i>The Times</i>, as saying, "My fear is that Abu Hassan's
trial will incriminate my clients and yet they still have not been charged
let alone had a chance to explain why they were in Aden."
<p>Basunaid said that he had been shown police files which claim the men
confessed to meeting Abu Hassan at an <i>al-Jihad</i> camp. There they
were given explosives and weapons, along with instructions. The Yemeni
authorities claim that the men were planning to blow up the British Consulate
in Aden on Christmas Day. However Basunaid insisted that these confessions
were made under torture.
<p><b>London Islamist organization may have funded attacks on British targets</b><BR>The British authorities are investigating claims that the five were
sent to Aden by the London-based Islamist group <i>Ansar al-Shariah, or </i>Supporters of Shariah (SOS). Several
of those being held in Aden are believed to be personally linked with the head of the organization, Abu Hamza. One of the five, Mohsin Ghailan is Abu Hamza's step-son.
Ghailen allegedly confessed to receiving &pound;1,200 from SOS to take
part in the operation. According to relatives of the suspects, the cleric's
17-year-old son, Mohammed Mustapha was on the run after escaping security
forces when they arrested the group last month.
<p>Meanwhile, the American FBI is investigating possible links with Osama
bin Ladin and the SOS, who is suspected of funding the London-based organization.
<p><b>"Blood on the streets"</b>
<br>Relatives of the accused warned of violent reprisals if the men are
executed. At a press conference at Birmingham's Central Mosque relatives
of the five warned that if the men were executed there would be "blood
on the streets." They denounced British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's
recent calls for the men to be charged or released, and said that he would
be to blame if the men were tried and executed.
<p>The relatives denied that the men were members of Supporters of Shariah,
and claimed that they had traveled to Yemen in order to study Arabic.
