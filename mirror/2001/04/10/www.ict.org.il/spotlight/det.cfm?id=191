<p><center><h2>Bomb Explodes on Turkish Bus</h2></center>
<p>

<P>A bomb exploded on a bus in central Turkey in the early hours of Friday
morning, killing four passengers and injuring seventeen. The bomb, apparently
operated by a timer, was hidden in the luggage rack above the bus door.
It went off just after midnight when the Istanbul-bound bus was about 14
km from the town of Kirikkale, east of Ankara.

<P>The bomb may have been planted in Sivas before the bus set out for Istanbul.
Forty-four passengers were aboard at the time of the explosion, some of
them relatives of Islamic militants arrested earlier this month for plotting
an attack on the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk during the Turkish
anniversary celebrations (<A HREF="det.cfm?id=182">Topic of the Day - November
4, 1998</A>). They reportedly were traveling to visit the detained in an
Istanbul prison.

<P>No organization has as yet taken responsibility for the blast. While
either the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) or Islamic militants could have
been behind the attack, the identity of the passengers would seem to mitigate
against any Islamic involvement. Most local speculation has focused on
the PKK, in particular as today is the 20th anniversary of the founding
of the organization, whose leader Abdullah Ocalan, was recently arrested
in Rome.

<P>Ocalan is currently the center of a crisis between Turkey, Italy and
Germany. Turkey is demanding his extradition, while Italy is weighing the
option of granting him political asylum or handing him over for trial in
Germany where his organization has carried out terrorist attacks.
