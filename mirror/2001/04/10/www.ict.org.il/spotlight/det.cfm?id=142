<p><center><h2>Further Details on the American Strikes</h2></center>
<p>

<P>Although the Pentagon remains reticent about the specific details of
the American strikes, certain reports have been filtering through to the press.
The assault is believed to have been launched from U.S. Navy warships in
the Gulf region. Two ships stationed in the Red Sea along with five in
the Arabian Sea--including a submarine--are said to have participated in
the action.

<P>A large number of cruise missiles were apparently used in the attack.
The weapons are guided by GPS satellite transmissions, which steer the
1000-lb. warheads to their target with a high degree of accuracy. The cruise
missile is said to be especially effective in certain terrain where reaching
a target is ordinarily a formidable task.

<P>Witnesses in Sudan report seeing five cruise missiles strike the El
Shifa Pharmaceutical Company’s headquarters. Other reports indicate two
low-flying jets had delivered payloads. The plant, according to U.S. sources,
manufactured a chief chemical component of VX nerve gas.

<P>In a BBC interview, the Sudanese ambassador to the UN, Mohamed Ahmed
Erwa categorically denied such allegations, arguing that the plant was
a privately owned civillian facility which manufactured antibiotics. Erwa
called the attack an act of “naked aggression,” against his country.

<P>As operational information is being hushed by Secretary of Defense William
Cohen and the Pentagon, it is possible that the operation is still underway.

<P>The U.S. has alerted its citizens abroad in expectation of reprisals
for the US military response. U.S. Security Adviser Sandy Berger, in a
press conference with Madelaine Albright, said that the FBI has issued
a high alert to police and security authorities.

<P>Secretary of State Albright declared, “The US will act unilaterally
when our interests are threatened.”

<P>There are reports that US intelligence sources have evidence that an
attack on the U.S. embassy in Yemen was imminent, which may well have been
one of the factors affecting the timing of the American offensive.
