<p><center><h2>Jordan Indicts Suspected Members of Terrorist Cell</h2></center>
<p><p>A Jordanian Military Court has indicted 28 Arab nationals on charges
of plotting to attack tourist targets in the Kingdom during the Millennium
celebrations.
<p>Fifteen suspects, including 13 Jordanians of Palestinian origin, an
Iraqi and an Algerian were arrested in December of last year. Jordanian
Military Attorney General Mamoun Khassawneh said that the suspects will
be tried in Jordan's State Security Court in mid-April.
<p><b>"Most dangerous terrorist group ever uncovered in Jordan"</b>
<br>The indictment lists 12 charges, including membership in an illegal
group, plotting to carry out terrorist attacks on American and tourist
targets during Millennium celebrations and possession of weapons and explosives.
Some of the charges carry the death penalty.
<p>Prosecutor General Lieutenant General Mahmoud Obeidat said the cell
was the most dangerous terrorist group ever uncovered in Jordan. The group
is linked to Osama bin Ladin's Al-Qaida organization, and reportedly received
extensive training in arms and explosive in camps belonging to bin Ladin
in Afghanistan.
<p>According to Xinhua News Agency the Jordanian police found radio-controlled
detonators, explosives, ammunition, raw material for bomb-making and nerve
gas hidden at a farm outside Amman, which they believe the suspects intended
to use in their planned attacks.
<p><b>Almost half of the defendants are still at large</b>
<br>Thirteen of the defendants named in the indictment are at large. Those
indicted <i>in absentia</i> were said to be in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Britain,
Lebanon and Syria. The Jordanian government has begun extradition proceedings
for some of the suspects.
<p>Those at large include Omar Mahmoud Abu Omar, a Muslim fundamentalist
residing in Britain, who, according to the indictment provided most of
the funding for the cell. Abu Omar is well known to Jordanian security
forces. In 1998 he was sentenced <i>in absentia</i> for his part in a series
of bomb blasts in Amman at the beginning of 1998, one of which targeted
the former official of Jordanian military intelligence.
<p>Abu Omar was the ideologue of a group known as "The movement of reform
and challenge" (<i>Harakat al-Islah wal-Tahaddi</i>). He was granted political
asylum in the UK. In the last few years Abu Omar served as one of the editors
of "Al-Ansar," the official publication of The Armed Islamic Group (GIA). He published his radical
Islamic ideas in a book "Between two Methods" (<i>Bayn al-Minhajayn</i>).
<p><b>Instructions to the cell came from Osama bin Ladin</b>
<br>Instructions to the cell were reportedly relayed by Zein Al Abiddeen
Hassan, an Egyptian national currently living in in Pakistan. "Zein Al
Abiddeen Hassan is the representative of Osama bin Ladin and one of the
senior officials of al-Qaidah organization," Obeidat said.
<p>Also indicted <i>in absentia</i> was Munir Maqdah, a Palestinian guerrilla
commander in a refugee camp in Lebanon. Khalil al Deek, a Jordanian with
U.S. citizenship extradited from Pakistan in December for what was said
to be links to bin Ladin was not named in the indictment. Khassawneh said
Deek was still under investigation but had no connection with the case.
<p>Shortly after the arrest of the cell, Jordanian officials identified
the leader of the group as Khader Abu Ghoshah. In 1993 Abu Ghoshah was
sentence to a jail term in Jordan for several bombings. He was released
before his sentence was served out by a royal pardon.
<p>From Jordan he traveled to Afghanistan, where, according to Jordanian
security forces, he was trained in explosives and bomb-making. Abu Ghoshah
formed a group called Jaish Mohammed (the Army of Mohammed), comprising
veterans of the Afghan conflict. Jordanian officials say the group was
behind some of the bombings last year in the Kingdom.
<p>Jordanian security forces had reportedly conducted surveillance on the
group from shortly after they entered Jordan from Afghanistan, but waited
to make arrests until all its members could be detained. The clampdown
came on December 5, after the last members of the group, most of whom traveled
on false passports, were once more back in the country.
<p>Security sources in Jordan say the group intended to launch attacks
against a hotel in Amman and tourist sites at Mount Nebo and the Jordan
Valley.
