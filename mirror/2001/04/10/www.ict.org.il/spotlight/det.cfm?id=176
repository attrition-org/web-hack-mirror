<p><center><h2>CIA to have Active Role in Implementing Anti-terror
Measures</h2></center>
<p>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The American Central Intelligence Agency is to have a
crucial--and very visible role--in the implementation of the peace agreement
signed last Friday in Washington.&nbsp; This new role was outlined in the
talks at Wye plantation last week.&nbsp; The CIA, already deeply involved
in behind-the-scenes diplomacy in the region, is to be boosted into a more
public role as moderator between the two sides.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>From espionage to diplomacy</FONT></B>
<BR>The CIA's involvement in similar activities in the region is not new.&nbsp;
In essence, the CIA's potential role as mediator and guarantor of the security
arrangement was laid out in the anti-terrorism summit meeting at Sharm
el-Sheikh in 1996.&nbsp; That meeting was attended by security and intelligence
authorities from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the United States,
Europe and the moderate Arab States.

<P>The American intelligence agency has developed a relationship with the
Palestinian Authority that would have have been unthinkable only a few
years ago.&nbsp; In fact, it was the Palestinians who pushed for the CIA
to have an active role as mediator of the agreements.

<P>Security analysts say that the acceptability of the CIA as an objective
arbiter for both sides is due in large part to the personal connections
of CIA director George Tenet. Over the past two years, Tenet has met with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on a number of occasions.&nbsp; The agency's
Tel Aviv station has played host to several meetings between Israeli and
Palestinian officials, acting as liaison between the two sides.

<P>On at least one occasion in the past two years, the CIA has delivered
a favorable verdict to the U.S. Senate concerning the Palestinian commitment
to fight terrorism.&nbsp; Tenet arranged to train Palestinian security
and intelligence officials in the United States, including the head of
the PA's intelligence apparatus on the West Bank Jabril Rajub.

<P>The CIA's relationship with both the Israeli and Palestinian intelligence
services place it in a unique position.&nbsp; While the two sides have
little trust in one another, it seems both have a measure of trust in the
Tenet's ability to mediate between them.

<P><B>The CIA as mediator</B>
<BR>Although not all points of the CIA's role have been made public, it
is clear that the agency's main role will be to oversee Palestinian compliance
with the terms of the agreement concerning the fight against terrorism.
Under the terms of the agreement, the CIA. station chief in Israel will
sit on a committee with the Israeli and Palestinian security officials.
His role will be that of liaison between the two sides.&nbsp; However,
the agency is also supposed to be a sort of "validator" of Palestinian
efforts to fight terrorism. Israel has complained on a number of occasions
that the Palestinian Authority is not living up to its commitment to destroy
the infrastructure of terrorism, and its promises to arrest terrorists
and confiscate illegal weapons.&nbsp; It will be the role of the CIA to
act as judge in future cases where PA anti-terror measures are called into
question.

<P>Under the terms of the Wye agreements, the CIA will be responsible for
a number of tasks, ranging from observer to judge:
<UL>
<LI>
The agency will validate whether 30 terrorists wanted in Israel are arrested
and tried by the Palestinian authorities.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The agency will ensure that convicted terrorists actually serve out their
sentence. This requires that the CIA oversee Palestinian trials of accused
terrorist and that the agency be informed when jailed militants are going
to be released and why.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The agency would ensure that wanted criminals and terrorists are suspended
from the Palestinian police force and not rehired.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The agency will validate whether the Palestinian Authority is reducing
the size of its police force from more than 40,000 to the 30,000 called
for in earlier accords.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The agency will oversee the Palestinian compliance with it promise to confiscate
illegal weapons from militants.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The agency will serve on a joint committee to monitor the Palestinian Authority's
prevention of incitement to violence on the part of Palestinian activist.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The agency will help to develop border-control devices to facilitate inspections
at border checkpoints in an effort to detect explosives and weapons.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Criticism of public role for the CIA</B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+0>Not all are comfortable with the CIA's new role. Senator
Richard Shelby, who chairs the Select Committee on Intelligence, has declared
that he intends to lead an investigation into the issue.&nbsp; In an interview
with "Fox News" he said that while he didn't think that he could keep the
CIA from performing an active role in the monitoring the security arrangement,
he wanted more information.</FONT>

<P>"I think it is troubling, troubling to me, troubling to a lot of people
that have overseen and worked with the C.I.A. and its mission over the
years," Shelby said. "The C.I.A. would be the implementer of policy here,
which is a big departure, and I think it's something we have to look into."

<P>Former CIA director James Woolsey said in an interview with CNN that
he was more comfortable with the CIA's intended role than he was with the
fact that the whole world knows about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that the
major danger in the CIA taking a "front and center" role is that the agency's
objectivity could be called into question. "If something goes wrong --
if this agreement doesn't work out, if there's a lot of criticism of it,
if one party doesn't abide by it, then, since the CIA's principal role
is collecting intelligence and being objective about that intelligence,
people may start to wonder whether or not the intelligence is or is not
being skewed in order to make the work that the agency was doing look good."
