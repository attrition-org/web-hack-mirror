<p><center><h2>Turkey Warns Syria over Support for Kurdish Rebels</h2></center>
<p>
Tension between Turkey and Syria has reached an all time high over the
issue of Syrian support of Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Southeastern
Turkey.&nbsp; Ankara has accused Syrian President Hafez al-Assad's government
of harboring the leaders of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), of allowing
PKK guerillas to train in the Syrian-controlled Beka'a Valley in Lebanon
and of providing the organization with arms to carry out terrorist attacks
against Turkey.

<P>The PKK has carried out cross-border attacks from Syria, Iraq and Iran.
But one of the main points of contention is Ankara's accusation that Syria
allows PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to operate out of Damascus. Since the
beginning of the PKK's fight for autonomy in 1983, over 29,000 people have
died on both sides of the conflict.

<P><B>Diplomacy amid military buildup</B>
<BR>Turkey's Chief of Staff, Gen. Hussein Kivrikoglu has said that Turkey
was in a state of "undeclared war" with Syria over the issue.&nbsp; Though
relations between the two countries have been strained by issues unrelated
to the Kurdish problem, such as water rights and Turkey's military ties
with Israel, this is apparently the first time that senior Turkish officials
have actually threatened military action.

<P>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been engaged in shuttle diplomacy
between the Turkish and Syrian capitals over the past few days in attempt
to reach a peaceful solution to the dispute. On Tuesday, Mubarak met with
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. According to local sources, the Egyptian
leader received a "less than enthusiastic" welcome.&nbsp; He was presented
with extensive evidence of Syrian support for the PKK over the past decade,
as well as a list of demands. On Thursday Mubarak held talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.

<P>Meanwhile Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told a meeting of his
party deputies, "We are warning Syria for the last time. We want them to
stop their support for separatist terrorism and stop their policies of
hostility. We are waiting for a reply from Syria."

<P>The Turkish media has carried reports of convoy and troop movements
from military bases in the Southeast to nearer the Syrian border. The army
has canceled leave for troops in bases along the border. There have also
been claims that the Syrians have moved mobile missile launchers nearer
its border with Turkey.

<P><B>Reactions to the crisis</B>
<BR>Most of the Arab countries have criticized Ankara for threatening military
action against Syria. Many of them feel threatened by Turkey's military
ties with Israel.&nbsp; In a declaration in the official <I>al-Thawra</I>
daily, Syria has called for "effective Arab solidarity" similar to that
which existed at the time of the Yom Kippur War when the Arab countries
united behind Syria and Egypt against Israel.

<P>The Arab League has come out in support of Syria, accusing Israel of
instigating the crisis. The Israeli government has stated that Israel is
in no way involved in the dispute, while the Israeli army has reduced patrols
along the Syrian border in an effort to defuse the tensions. Lebanon, Jordan,
Algeria and Saudi Arabia have called for a peaceful settlement to the crisis.
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi initiated talks in Damascus
on Thursday in what he called an attempt to prevent "another war in the
Middle&nbsp; East."

<P>Washington has called for restraint from both sides, apparently worried
about the increased polarization of the region. Syria and Iraq are united against Turkey in a long-standing conflict
over the use of water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, whose sources
are in Turkey. Turkey is backed, if informally, by Jordan and Israel.&nbsp;
In addition, Turkey is a NATO ally, and has cordial ties with the United
States.

<P><B>Turkey "winning the battle but loosing the war"</B>
<BR>Turkish troops have carried out frequent raids in northern Iraq against
PKK bases, as well as a series of controversial covert operations against
PKK members in Turkey and elsewhere. One of Ankara's major successes on
the diplomatic front resulted in the PKK being put on the U.S. State Department's
list of terrorist organizations.&nbsp; Some commentators claim that although
Ankara has scored significant military successes against the PKK, it is
now in danger of "loosing the propaganda war," as the separatist group
goes more political.&nbsp; Last month, the PKK declared a ceasefire, claiming
that it would no longer attack Turkish government installations and would
fight only if attacked.
