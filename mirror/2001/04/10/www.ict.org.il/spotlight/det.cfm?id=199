<p><center><h2>Hamas' Official Analysis of the Wye River Accord</h2></center>
<p>
<BR>The following analysis was published on the&nbsp; official Hamas website
on November 20th, 1998. The tone of the analysis is relatively moderate
in comparison to similar previous and present publications of Hamas. It
does not go beyond a legitimate and quite fair criticism. This may be the
consequence of the harsh measures taken by the Palestinian Authority since
the end of October 1998 against Hamas and Islamic individuals who have
publicly criticized the accord. One of the prominent signs of its moderation
is the wide use of the term Israel instead of "the enemy" or worse, and
the appeal to logic rather than emotion.

<P>The Wye Plantation Accord was signed on October 23rd, 1998, after more
than a year and a half in which there was no activity in the Israeli-Palestinian
reconciliation process, and after several visits and meetings of American
messenger Denis Ross and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with Arafat
and Netanyahu. The Accord was reached only as a result of the concentrated
talks that lasted nine days at Wye River Plantation with the active participation
of American President Bill Clinton. The preparations for the accord included
a Palestinian acceptance of the Israeli proposal of redeployment of 10%+3%,
which was adopted by the American government after Israel had rejected
the American proposal of 13% in the occupied West Bank. Therefore, the
talks focused on the security part of the accord plus the arrangements
of the other stages: the airport, safe roads, prisoners, and the change
of the Palestinian National Charter and economic issues.&nbsp;

<P><B>American pressure...Palestinian submission...limited Israeli response</B>&nbsp;

<P>Uri Savir, one of the engineers of the Oslo Accord and director general
of the Foreign Ministry in the era of the Labor Party, described the last
accord as an American- Palestinian accord. He was more than right in the
sense of the prominent role for the first time of the American government
in drafting the accord and in supervising the execution of the security
articles of the accord, which will be presented first to the American intelligence.
The Palestinian Authority will supply the CIA with a daily report of the
achievements.&nbsp;

<P>The other side of the accord is the fact that the Palestinians put all
their bets on the Americans, hoping that they would put pressure on Israel,
something has not happened. The American Administration under President
Clinton was anxious to reach an agreement without paying attention to its
content, without pressure on Netanyahu but by pushing Arafat to response
to all the Israeli demands. After the sexual scandals of Clinton and on
the eve of the elections for the Congress, the Democratic Party was very
much eager to present voters with an that would increase the chances of
the party in the upcoming elections and the victory of Al Gore in the presidential
elections of 2000. Therefore, the presence of Al Gore in the ceremony of
signing the accord in Washington was not surprising, although he had no
prominent role in the negotiations.&nbsp;

<P>Netanyahu, who has threatened to make waves in Washington if Clinton
put any pressure upon him to accept his proposal, was well aware that this
administration was not capable of putting any pressure upon him. Therefore,
he attempted throughout the talks to achieve as many gains as possible.
The most important of them was to make the CIA supervisor of the Palestinian
security services according to the Israeli agenda, as long as the Israeli
security services could not do that themselves because they could threaten
what was left of the honor of the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu has
also succeeded in extracting an American promise to let the Israelis define
the size of the third redeployment. Moreover, the Americans submitted to
the demand of Netanyahu to sign a partial accord and delay some of the
problems to further talks.&nbsp;

<P>Immediately after the Wye Accord, the Israeli government signed an agreement
of strategic cooperation with the United States, to improve her power of
deterrence and defense against weapons of mass destruction. The agreement
includes direct and immediate American aid in case the Zionist entity is
exposed to attacks by this kind of weapon, which according to Israeli and
the American claims is owned by Iran, Syria and Iraq. This agreement is
regarded, according to Israeli evaluations, as a quality supplement to
the Israeli-American strategic cooperation agreement signed in 1981, after
the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.&nbsp;

<P>Netanyahu has achieved by this agreement most of his demands, especially
in the security dimension. He has begun to confront a right wing opposition
that accused him of high treason as it did to his predecessor Rabin. But
the Israeli Prime Minister prepared himself for such an opposition by appointing
Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister, who took part in the talks in Why Plantation
and supported Netanyahu’s position on the accord. The support of such a
right wing extremist, who is well known for his hostility towards the Palestinians,
minimizes the attacks of the Israeli right.&nbsp;

<P>The Palestinian side made plenty of concessions in the talks and withdrew
several times from its positions, which focused on the adherence to the
American proposal in order to achieve all the issues at stake, the most
important of which was the redeployment of 13% of the West Bank. The biggest
pressure on the Palestinian Authority to accept the accord was a certain
achievement connected with the land. This was in order to justify its adherence
to the Oslo Accord, in the face of an increase in opposition to that Accord
in the shadow of the absence of any real achievement, and the decline in
popularity of the Palestinian Authority as a consequence of its negative
behavior. The Palestinian Authority was afraid of the continuing political
stagnation that could push Netanyahu to put an end to the Oslo Accord and
even to abolish the Palestinian Authority and annex the Palestinian lands.
Therefore, the Palestinian Authority has approved all the American proposals,
hoping to increase the pressures on Netanyahu to implement the agreement.&nbsp;

<P><B>Reading the articles of the agreement</B>&nbsp;

<P>The agreement included the issues of the redeployment, security, the
arrangements of the intermediate period (the airport, the port, the industrial
zone, secure passage, the Palestinian prisoners, the legal and economic
arrangements and coordination, the talks on the permanent settlement and
the so called "one-side measures."&nbsp;

<P>Most of the accord focused on the security issues, as was expected.
The redeployment was linked to the security measures of the Palestinian
Authority during 12 weeks. The accord has established a temporary agenda
for the measures that the Palestinian Authority was to take in three months.
It contained the drawing-up of a comprehensive security plan to fight the
alleged "terrorism" and its infrastructure. The plan includes the arrest
and imprisonment of wanted individuals under direct American supervision
and full coordination with the Israelis. It includes also the exchange
of intelligence information; the continuance of the security coordination
and cooperation; publishing a decree against agitation; outlawing armed
organizations; a comprehensive plan for the collection of arms and prevention
of smuggling and the reduction of the number of Palestinian policemen.&nbsp;

<P>The accord divided the first and second redeployment that were merged
into one stage, to three steps or so called "pulses", which will be executed
according to the implementation of the security accord by the Palestinians.
At the end of the redeployment the Palestinian Authority will have security
and civil control of 18.2% of the West Bank (zone A), Palestinian civil
control and Israeli security control over 21.8% (zone B), and 60% under
full Israeli control. It means that the Palestinian Authority will have
full control over less than 20% of the land of the West Bank. In other
words - only 4% of the total area of Palestine. It should be noted that
the Israeli side has not even presented the maps of the redeployment and
has held on to the right to determine its details.&nbsp;

<P>The accord made provisions for the establishment of a special Israeli-Palestinian
committee to deal with the third redeployment, noting the letter of former
American Secretary of State Warren Christopher, which had been annexed
to the Hebron agreement and gave Israel the right to determine the area
of the redeployment. The Israeli government has already determined that
the third stage of the redeployment winclude no more than 1%.&nbsp;

<P>The opening of the Northern pass that will connect Gaza with the North
of the West Bank was delayed until further talks that will include also
the issues of the port and the economic and legal issues. The accord did
not include the release of prisoners, but there was an oral agreement to
release 750 Palestinian prisoners who have not carried out operations that
lead to the killing or wounding of Israelis, and those who do not belong
to Hamas or the Islamic Jihad.&nbsp;

<P>The accord demands that the Palestinian Authority ultimately change
the Palestinian charter by convening the Executive Committee and the Central
Council, and the ratification of the change in a convention of the central
bodies of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. But, it does not demand
that the Israeli side cease the settlement activity or the enlargement
of the existing settlements, except for the call to both sides to refrain
from any one-sided measures, conveyed by letters of guarantees by the American
administration to each party. The letters included an American objection
to the declaration of a Palestinian independent state on one hand, and
to the establishment of new settlements, on the other.&nbsp;

<P>It was concluded to begin the talks on the permanent settlement as soon
as possible, even before the end of the talks of the intermediate arrangements.
This was the request of Netanyahu, to which the Palestinian Authority has
objected, because it may bring the talks on the permanent settlement to
sink in the issues of the intermediate arrangements and weaken the position
of the Palestinian Authority.&nbsp;

<P><B>A partial security agreement... The Zionist Entity is the big winner</B>&nbsp;

<P>The meticulous reading of the accord and the Israeli, Palestinian, Arab
and International reactions to it, reveals as follows:&nbsp;

<P>1. Although it was not a new accord but a continuation to a former one,
the accord has established a new basis for including the security measures
in the implementations of the Oslo Accord. It also gives the security measures
the position of the judge and arbitrator of its execution, according to
determined and clear demands that leave no way for the Palestinian Authority
to get rid of it or to interpret on it according to its interests.&nbsp;

<P>Security has always been a basic axis in the Oslo Accord but its interpretation
was always discussed in the framework of the Israeli-Palestinian security
coordination. It gave both sides the ability to exclude all the marginal
details that are usually agreed on in such meetings. But the Wye River
Accord made these marginal issues an integral part of the accord, according
to an inflexible time table, under direct supervision of the CIA and by
dual Israeli-Palestinian security coordination and Israeli- Palestinian-American
triple one.&nbsp;

<P>2. The accord has determined the principle of renegotiating what has
been agreed upon in the past. The accord does not include new articles
aside from those accepted in the past. But, there was a change of what
has been agreed upon, like the change of part of the redeployed area into
a nature reserve and the participation of the CIA in the supervision over
the execution of the security plan by the Palestinian Authority and the
ratification of the change of the Palestinian National Charter.&nbsp;

<P>3. Contrary to the demands of the Palestinian Authority, the accord
does not include all the issues of the intermediate stage. It does not
include the third redeployment and has delayed other issues such as the
port, the secured pass, and the civil, legal and economic problems, into
further negotiations after the beginning in the execution of the accord.&nbsp;

<P>4. The accord has ignored the principle cause for the cessation of the
peace process, which was the establishment of new settlements and the enlargement
of existing ones, especially the project of Jabal Abu Ghneim that had brought
the negotiations to a halt. This is a clear Palestinian concession of a
previous condition and a victory for Netanyahu and his policy of imposing
the existing situation and pushing the Palestinians to submit to him in
the end.&nbsp;

<P>5. The opening of the negotiations on the permanent solution before
the end of the intermediate stage means the deferment of these issues.
This will negatively influence the Palestinian position towards the permanent
solution, which is more difficult and complicated. The Israeli side will
try to drown the talks on the delayed issues, and the negotiating grounds
of the Palestinian Authority will be weakened.&nbsp;

<P>6. The accord has come to rescue Netanyahu from his international solitude
and presented him as one who wishes to move towards a settlement, without
granting the Palestinians any real achievements except for the redeployment,
but with limiting conditions that the Palestinian Authority might not be
able to fulfill. Hence, the Palestinian Authority could be presented as
the party responsible for the abolition of what has already been agreed
upon. If President Clinton was strengthened by the agreement in his internal
position, then the Palestinian side is the biggest loser. This is a result
of its concessions, the threat on the texture of the Palestinian national
unity and of turning its back to the Arab world. The Arab world in general
does not support the signing of the accord by the Palestinian Authority,
as shown by the negative reactions in the Arab world after the signing.&nbsp;

<P>7. The supervision of the CIA over the security plan of the Palestinian
Authority is symbolic of a reduction of its sovereignty, which is ridiculous
anyway. It is also an admission that the Palestinian side is interested
in the violation of the security part of the accord, and limits the principle
of reciprocity as stated in the accord to measures taken only by the Palestinian
side without similar steps taken by the Israeli one.&nbsp;

<P><B>Doubts over the implementation... the resistance continues</B>&nbsp;

<P>The Wye Plantation Accord does not differ from former agreements in
the continuation of the policy of Palestinian concessions. But, its signing
under direct American pressure, Netanyahu’s doubts about it and his wish
to get out of it’s implementation even at the cost of lookin ridiculous,
plus the security conditions that are impossible for the Palestinian Authority
to execute despite its serious intentions—all this casts doubt on the possible
success of this accord. The conduct of Netanyahu and the Israeli government
after signing the accord—the presenting of new conditions that are missing
in it such as the ratification of the accord by the PNC by two-thirds,
the confirmation of each redeployment, the continuance of settlements and
the green light for the construction of Jabal Abu Ghneim settlement because
the agreements concerning the settlements do not include occupied Jerusalem—all
of these clearly show that the accord is not going to rescue the peace
process from its crisis. This may be an introduction to a new crisis.&nbsp;

<P>But, the most dangerous element of the accord is the attempt to strip
the Palestinian people of its sole remaining power—the resistance—after
they lost other elements such as the <I>Intifadah</I>, the relatively united
Arab stand, and the ability to play on the contradictions of the dual polarity
which existed until the beginning of the 1990s before the collapse of the
Soviet Union. The intention here is to ease the negative results of the
resistance operations on the Israeli political elite that hurries to show
its success in this field to its people, which is bound by the combination
of security and fear. Furthermore, there is an intention to deprive the
Palestinians of any card they could use to achieve some of their rights
or to gain from the power of "the balance of fear" with the Israeli side,
in order to push the Palestinians at the end to accept whatever Israel
would offer them.&nbsp;

<P>The conditioning of the accord on the success of the Palestinian Authority
to liquidate the Palestinian resistance seems inappropriate. Israel, with
all its power and despite continuous waves of persecution and blows, has
failed to eliminate the Palestinian resistance and prevent its operations
against the occupation. The PaIsraeli-American-Jordanian coordination also
failed. The attacks of the Palestinian security apparatuses before and
after the Sharem el-Sheikh conference also failed to put an end to the
armed operations of the resistance, even if there were some successes in
weakening it for some periods.&nbsp;

<P>It is clear that the Palestinian resistance will go on. It is clear
also that if the Palestinian Authority continues to oppress the Palestinian
people under the terms of Wye Plantation, such as the outlawing of the
armed organizations, confiscation of arms, arrests planned by Israel and
the United States and the so called "prevention of incitement," the Palestinian
people will be exposed to the danger of civil war from which only the Israelis
will benefit.&nbsp;

<P>It seems that the position of the Palestinian opposition headed by Hamas
towards the accord is stronger and more attractive, due to the Arab official
reservation of leading countries like Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, plus
the increasing popular Arabic and Islamic opposition. Above all, the continuous
extremist conduct of Netanyahu does not grant the accord a great chance
of success, which allows for the possibility of the return of the cycle
of crises and increases the legitimacy of the Palestinian program of resistance.&nbsp;<B></B>
