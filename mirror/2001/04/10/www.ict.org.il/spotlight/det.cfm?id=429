<p><center><h2>Leaders of UK-based Terror Cell Indicted in U.S.</h2></center>
<p>
<P>The leaders of a militant Islamic cell based in Britain were indicted
in the United States this week for their role in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.

<P>Ibrahim Hussein Adbel Hadi Eidarous and Adel Abdul Magid Abdul-Bari,
both from Egypt, were listed in an expanded indictment filed in the Manhattan
federal court on Monday. The indictment, first filed in 1998 accused Osama
bin Ladin and members of his network of conspiring to kill American nationals.

<P>The expanded indictment brings to seventeen the number so far charged
in the embassy bombings. Six of the suspects are now held in the United
States, while three are in England. The other eight, including Osama bin
Ladin, remain at large. The U.S. government is offering a $5 million reward
for information leading to bin Ladin's arrest and conviction.

<P><B>Defendants allegedly headed London bin Ladin cell</B>
<BR>Eidarous and Abdul-Bari were arrested in July 1999 in the UK, where
they allegedly headed the London cell of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.
The Egyptian group, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, joined bin Ladin's "International
Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders" (<I>Al-Jabhah
al-Islamiyyah al-`Alamiyyah li-Qital al-Yahud wal-Salibiyyin</I>) in February
1998.

<P>Al-Zawahiri, who was sentenced to death <I>in absentia</I> in his native
Egypt last April was a signatory to bin Ladin's <A HREF="../articles/fatwah.htm">fatwa</A>
making it a religious duty for Muslims "to kill Americans and their allies,
civilians as well as army men, and steal their money wherever they are."
The indictment claimed that both Eidarous and Abdul-Bari had a copy of
the fatwah in their possession.

<P>Abdul-Bari was sentenced to death in absentia in Egypt for plotting
to blow up a Cairo bazaar.

<P><B>Fingerprints found on claims of responsibility</B>
<BR>On Aug. 4, 1998, three days before the embassy bombings, the Egyptian
Islamic Jihad issued a statement threatening to retaliate against America
for the extradition of four Egyptian Islamists arrested in Albania. The
men were arrested on an American tip, and turned over to the Egyptian authorities,
under American pressure.

<P>A copy of this statement was found in the suspect's London office, together
with papers claiming responsibility for the embassy bombings. According
to the indictment fingerprints of the two were also found on the claims
of responsibility that had been sent from London to three media organizations
in France, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates the day after the bombings.

<P>The two are currently in jail in Britain pending there extradition to
the United States. The trial has been slated for September 5 of this year.
