<p><center><h2>Bin Ladin Associate Pleads Guilty in U.S. Court</h2></center>
<p>
<p>A former U.S. Army sergeant pleaded guilty friday to helping to plot
the U.S. embassy bombings and participating in a terrorist conspiracy against Americans.
<p>Ali Mohamed, 48, pleaded guilty in the Federal District Court in Manhattan
to a total of five charges of conspiracy to murder, kidnap and maim U.S.
citizens abroad, and conspiracy to destroy U.S. national defense sites.
His testimony directly linked, for the first time, Osama bin Ladin to the
bombings of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
<p><b>A trusted bin Ladin lieutenant</b>
<br>For most of the past decade, Ali Mohamed was in a unique position to
further bin Ladin's terrorist activities. A native of Egypt, Mohamed served
for three years as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, where he taught special
forces personnel about Islam and Muslim culture. Before that he served
in the Egyptian Army. Upon his discharge from the army in 1989, he became
a naturalized U.S. citizen.
<p>Even before his service in the U.S. Army, Mohamed had become involved
in the Egyptian al-Jihad group--the same group that was responsible for
the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981. Al-Jihad joined
bin Ladin's al-Qaidah network in the early 1990's. Its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri,
is reported to have sat on the al-Qaidah ruling council, which planned
the embassy attacks and is now believed to be in hiding with bin Ladin
in Afghanistan
<p>Mohamed said that he became acquainted with bin Ladin's organization
around the time al-Jihad joined al-Qaida. In 1991, he helped bin Laden
to relocate his base of operations from Afghanistan to Sudan.
<p>In 1992, three years after Mohamed became a U.S. citizen, he traveled
to Afghanistan to instruct al-Qaidah members in basic explosives and intelligence
training, teaching them how to create operational cells. In 1994, Mohamed
was summoned to Sudan to train bin Ladin's personal bodyguards, and to
coordinate with Sudanese intelligence agents who were responsible for bin
Ladin's security outside his compound.
<p><b>Operational methods</b>
<br>Mohamad's testimony provided a fascinating glimpse into the methods
of bin Ladin's al-Qaidah network. The goal of the group's activities was
to force the United States and other Western governments out of the Middle
East
<p>According to Mohamed, in the early 1990's he began working closely with
bin Ladin's top aides, including Wadih el-Hage, another of the defendants
facing trial in New York, to help bin Ladin to create "a presence in Nairobi,
Kenya."
<p>"A car business was set up to create income," Mohamed said. "Wadih el-Hage
created a charity organization that would help provide al-Qaidah members
with identity documents. I personally helped el-Hage by making labels in
his home in Nairobi. We used various code names to conceal our identities."
<p>Mohamed said he was told by bin Laden in late 1993 to survey potential
U.S., British, French and Israeli targets in Nairobi. Among those targets,
which he said were chosen to retaliate against the United States for its
intervention in the civil war in Somalia, was the American Embassy in Nairobi.
<p>"I took pictures, drew diagrams and wrote a report," he said. He later
took his report to Khartoum, Sudan, where he said they were reviewed by
Osama bin Laden, and his top aides. "Bin Laden looked at the picture of
the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide
bomber," Mohamed said.

<p><b>More trials expected</b>
<br>Of the 17 people indicted in the United States, Mohamed is the first
to appear in court. Five more suspects are due to appear in court on 3
January, 2001. The U.S. has filed extradition requests for three others
currently detained in Britain, while eight suspects, including bin Ladin
himself, remain at large. The U.S. government has offered a $5 million
reward for the capture of each of the eight fugitives.
<p>It was not clear whether Ali Mohamed would testify against his five
co-defendants, two of whom would face the death penalty if convicted, or
in what other ways he might help in the government's investigation or its
search for eight other fugitives, including Mr. bin Laden.
<p>The New York times reported on 21 October that prosecutors claim to
have won the cooperation of at least one other close bin Ladin aide. The
man, identified in court papers only as CS-1, is said to be a convicted
terrorist who worked with bin Ladin from 1989 to 1996.

<center><b><font size=+1>Excerpts From Guilty Plea in Embassy Bombing Case</font></b></center>

<p><b>Source: New York Times</b>
<p>Following are excerpts from a preliminary court transcript of a hearing
in Federal District Court in Manhattan in which Ali A. Mohamed pleaded
guilty to five charges in connection with a broad terrorism conspiracy:
<p>MR. MOHAMED Your honor, in the early 1980's I became involved with the
Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization. In the early 1990's, I was introduced
to Al Qaeda — Al Qaeda is the organization headed by Osama bin Laden —
through my involvement with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.
<p>In 1992, I conducted military and basic explosives training for Al Qaeda
in Afghanistan. . . .
<p>In 1991, I helped transport Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan to the
Sudan.
<p>When I engaged in these activities . . . I understood that I was working
with Al Qaeda, bin Laden, Abu Hafs, Abu Ubaidah, and that Al Qaeda had
a shura council . . .
<p>In late 1993, I was asked by bin Laden to conduct surveillance of American,
British, French and Israeli targets in Nairobi. Among the targets I did
surveillance for was the American Embassy . . . These targets were selected
to retaliate against the United States for its involvement in Somalia.
I took pictures, drew diagrams, and wrote a report. Khalid al-Fawwaz paid
for my expenses and the photo enlarging equipment. He was in Nairobi at
this time.
<p>I later went to Khartoum, where my surveillance files and photographs
were reviewed by Osama bin Laden, Abu Hafs, Abu Ubaidah, and others. Bin
Laden looked at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where
a truck could go as a suicide bomber.
<p>In 1994, bin Laden sent me to Djibouti to do surveillance on several
facilities, including French military bases and the American Embassy.
<p>In 1994, after an attempt to assassinate bin Laden, I went to the Sudan
in 1994 to train bin Laden's bodyguards, security detail. I trained those
conducting the security of the interior of his compound, and coordinated
with the Sudanese intelligence agents who were responsible for the exterior
security. . . .
<p>I was aware of certain contacts between Al Qaeda and Al Jihad organization,
on one side, and Iran and Hezbollah on the other side. I arranged security
for a meeting in the Sudan between Mugniyah, Hezbollah's chief, and bin
Laden. Hezbollah provided explosives training for Al Qaeda and Al Jihad.
Iran supplied Egyptian Jihad with weapons. Iran also used Hezbollah to
supply explosives that were disguised to look like rocks.
<p>In late 1994, I was in Nairobi. Abu Hafs met another man and me in the
back of Wadih el- Hage's house. Abu Hafs told me, along with someone else,
to do surveillance for the American, British, French and Israeli targets
in Senegal in West Africa.
<p>At about this time, late 1994, I received a call from an F.B.I. agent
who wanted to speak to me about the upcoming trial of United States v.
Abdel Rahman. I flew back to the United States, spoke to the F.B.I., but
didn't disclose everything that I knew.
<p>I reported on my meeting with the F.B.I. to Abu Hafs and was told not
to return to Nairobi.
<p>In 1995, I obtained a copy of the co-conspirator list for the Abdel
Rahman trial. I sent the list to el-Hage in Kenya, expecting that it would
be forwarded to bin Laden in Khartoum.
<p>In 1996, I learned from el-Hage that Abu Ubaidah had drowned.
<p>In 1998, I received a letter from Ihab Ali in early January 1998. The
letter said that el-Hage had been interviewed by the F.B.I. in Kenya, and
gave me a contact number for el-Hage. I called the number and then called
someone who would pass the message to Fawwaz for bin Laden.
<p>After the bombing in 1998, I made plans to go to Egypt and later to
Afghanistan to meet bin Laden. Before I could leave, I was subpoenaed to
testify before the grand jury in the Southern District of New York. I testified,
told some lies, and was then arrested.
<p>Mr. Mohamed was then questioned by Judge Leonard B. Sand:
<p>JUDGE SAND The overall objective of all these activities you described
was, what?
<p>MR. MOHAMED Just to — I was involved in the Islamic Jihad organization,
and the Islamic Jihad organization had a very close link to Al Qaeda, the
organization for bin Laden. And the objective of all this, just to attack
any Western target in the Middle East, to force the government of the Western
countries just to pull out from the Middle East, not to interfere in the
——
<p>JUDGE SAND And to achieve that objective, did the conspiracy include
killing nationals of the United States?
<p>MR. MOHAMED Yes, sir. Based on the Marine explosion in Beirut . . .
and the American pull- out from Beirut, they will be the same method, to
force the United States to pull out from Saudi Arabia.
<p>JUDGE SAND And it included conspiracy to murder persons who were involved
in government agencies and embassies overseas?
<p>MR. MOHAMED Yes, your honor.
<p>JUDGE SAND And to destroy buildings and properties of the United States?
<p>MR. MOHAMED Yes, your honor.
<p>JUDGE SAND And to attack national-defense utilities?
<p>MR. MOHAMED Yes, your honor.
