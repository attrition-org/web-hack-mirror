<p><center><h2>Trial of Bin Ladin Associates Opens in New York</h2></center>
<p><p>A jury of 12 people and six alternates is scheduled
to hear opening statements as the trial of four men suspected of links
to the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa gets underway
today in a federal courthouse in New York.


<p>U.S. federal prosecutors allege that the defendants are
linked to Saudi exile Osama bin Ladin, who is charged with leading a decade-long
worldwide conspiracy to kill Americans and destroy U.S. government property.
He is accused of ordering the embassy bombings, which killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans, and injured more than 4,000 people.
<p><b>Lengthy trial expected</b>
<br>The trial is expected to last 9 or 10 months. Prosecutors say they
are bringing more than 100 witnesses to New York from six countries. The
indictment runs to nearly 150 pages. The jury will be anonymous, referred
to only by numbers, to ensure security and privacy.
<p>Twenty-two men have been charged in the bombings of the embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. Of these only four will be standing trial in the current
proceedings. Two other suspects are held in the U.S., one of whom will
be tried separately and one of whom has already pleaded guilty.
<p>Ali Mohammed, a former U.S. Army sergeant entered a guilty plea in October
to charges of conspiracy and murder and is expected to testify against
the others. It was Mohammed's testimony which provided the first direct
link between Osama bin Ladin and the embassy bombings.
<p>Ali Mohammed began working for bin Ladin in the early 1990's. In his
testimony, he admitted that bin Ladin asked him in 1993 to conduct surveillance
of the American Embassy in Nairobi and other potential bombing targets.
When he returned to Sudan and showed bin Ladin his file, "bin Laden looked
at the picture of the American Embassy and pointed to where a truck could
go as a suicide bomber."

<p><b>Main conspirators still at large</b>
<br>Three additional suspects are jailed in Britain awaiting extradition
to the United States. They are Khalid al-Fawwaz, Ibrahim Eidarous and Adel
Abdel Bary. All three have been charged in the conspiracy to murder U.S.
citizens and military personnel. Eidarous and Bary have also been charged
in the embassy bombings.<p>Thirteen others, including accused terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden
and the top leadership of his al-Qaida organization remain fugitives. All
are charged with being part of bin Ladin's terrorist conspiracy to "murder
U.S. nationals anywhere in the world, kill U.S. military personnel in Somalia
and the Saudi Arabian Peninsula, and kill U.S. embassy workers."
<p>The 13 fugitives are: Osama bin Ladin. Muhammed Atef, Ayman al-Zawahiri,
Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, Mustafa Mohammed Fadhil, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani,
Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah,
Saif al-Adel, Musin Musa Matwalli Atwah, Anas al-Liby and Ahmed Mohammed
Hamed Ali.
<p>The four men on trial in New York have pleaded innocent to murder charges
and two of them face the death penalty if convicted.
<ul>
<li>
Khalfan Khamis Mohammed, 27, is the only defendant in custody charged with
a role in the bombing of the American embassy in Tanzania. He faces the
death penalty if convicted.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Mohammed Rashid Daoud al Owhali, 23, a Saudi, could also be executed for
throwing a grenade at embassy guards in the bombing of the US Embassy in
Nairobi. He has said that the attack was supposed to be a suicide mission,
and that he had not expected to survive the blast.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Wadih el Hage, 40, a Lebanon-born US citizen, admitted that he served in
the early 1990s as bin Ladin's personal secretary. He faces life in prison
if convicted.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Mohammed Sadeek Odeh, 35, a Jordanian national, is accused of planning
and executing the embassy attack in Nairobi. He faces life in prison if
convicted.</li>
</ul>
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a Sudanese national, will be tried separately. He
faces additional charges of attacking a prison guard and attempting to
carry out an elaborate escape plan. Suspected of being one of bin Ladin's
top financial officers, Salim reportedly attempted to procure weapons of
mass destruction for bin Ladin. He was extradited to the United States
from Germany after his arrest near Munich in late 1998.
<p><b>Mystery witness may make first statement</b>
<br>According to a report in today's <i>New York Times, </i>there are indications
that the government's first witness in the bombing trial will be an informer
who worked for bin Ladin until 1996, when he agreed to cooperate with the
American authorities.
<p>The witness, identified only as CS-1, is reported to be a convicted
terrorist whose identity has been kept secret for almost five years. According
to the <i>New York Times,</i> the testimony of CS-1 is the basis for many
of the significant charges in the indictment.&nbsp; These include allegations
that bin Ladin's group trained those who carried out the fatal ambush of
American soldiers in Somalia in 1993, that he cooperated with other terrorist
groups such as the Iranian-backed Hizballah, and sought to obtain materials
that could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
<p>Prior to the opening of the trial, there was speculation that CS-1 was Sidi Tayyib, a businessman who
was married to one of Mr. bin Ladin's relatives and was said to be cooperating
with the American and Saudi governments. A 1997 computer document seized
by investigators includes remarks by one of bin Ladin's operatives to the
effect that "an important man with close links [to bin Ladin] seems to
have fallen into the enemy's hands." The operative reportedly suggested
the traitor was Sidi Tayyib and expressed anxiety over the security of
the "East African network."
<p>However, the mystery witness was later identified as Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, a one-time bin Ladin aide. He is said to have managed the payrolls of al-Qaida during its early years, and claims to have been one of the first to swear alligiance to bin Ladin.
<p><b>Kenya evidence allowed in court</b>
<br>The government's case has been bolstered by the decision by U.S. District
Judge Leonard Sand not to throw out incriminating statements made by the
four defendants to investigators. Among those statements is a confession
by al-'Owhali, who allegedly admitted riding in the truck used to bomb
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and described the attack as a "martyrdom operation."
Court papers show that when he was questioned by U.S. investigators immediately
after his capture, he attempted to bargain with them by offering them "blue
chip" information.
<p>Further evidence may include a 1998 statement by one of the defendants
that he knew of plans to attack a U.S. warship in Yemen. The defendant
reportedly told the FBI about a plan to carry out a rocket attack against
a U.S. warship in Yemen. The FBI sent a warning to the Pentagon on Aug.
26, 1998, resulting in the cancellation of a visit of one U.S. warship
to Yemen.
<p>Then, on Oct. 12, 2000 the USS Cole was bombed while it was refueling
in the Yemeni port of Aden. Bin Ladin, while not formally charged, is suspected
of being behind the blast in which a small boat loaded with explosives
blew up alongside the ship, killing 17 U.S. sailors.
<p><b>New evidence links al-Qaidah to Hizballah</b>
<br>Last month, NBC News quoted unidentified American officials as saying
that the trial would reveal connections between al-Qaidah and other Iran
and Hizballah, in addition to the known links to the Egyptian and Yemeni
groups. According to the officials, prosecutors are expected to detail
meetings between bin Ladin's representative and an official of the Iranian
government. The goal of the meetings was reportedly to establish an "anti-U.S.
alliance."
<p>In addition, testimony will be brought forward concerning a meeting
between bin Ladin and Imad Mugniyeh, the operations director of the Iranian-backed
Hizballah organization. The bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa
bear an operational resemblance to Hizballah suicide attacks against the
U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983.
<p>The bombing succeeded in ousting the United States from Lebanon, a goal
that bin Ladin would like to see repeated in the case of American troops
in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Muslim world.
