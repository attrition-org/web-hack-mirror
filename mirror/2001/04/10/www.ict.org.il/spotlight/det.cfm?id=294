<p><center><h2>Taliban on Alert for Possible U.S. Strikes</h2></center>
<p>
<p>The Afghan Taliban has reportedly beefed up security at two training
camps for fear of a strike by American forces. Citing reports that three
U.S warships had entered Pakistan's territorial waters near the Gawadar
coast, the Afghani media reported that two major Islamic military camps have been put under heavy guard.
<p><b>Security increased around Osama bin Ladin</b>
<br>The Afghan News reported that the Islamic Militia has restricted access
to Rishkur, south of Kabul and Tora Boora in Nangahar province. The heavily
fortified former army base at Tora Boora is believed to be the new base
of Osama bin Ladin, who left his former base at Kandahar several months
ago. The move came after a falling-out with his Taliban hosts, who insisted
at the time that they did not know where bin Ladin was.
<p>Earlier this month the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on the Taliban for harboring
bin Ladin and his network. An <a href="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=26">executive
order </a>signed by President Clinton states that the sanctions were imposed
due to "the actions and policies of the Taliban in Afghanistan, in allowing
territory under its control in Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven and
base of operations for Osama bin Ladin and the Al-Qaida organization,"
which has "committed and threaten to continue to commit acts of violence
against the United States and its nationals."
<p>Taliban supreme leader Mullah Muhammad Omar has rejected U.S. demands
either to extradite Osama bin Ladin, or expel him to a neutral third country.
At recent peace talks between the Taliban and opposition forces, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth raised the issue of bin Ladin's
continued presence in Taliban territory. "We believe terrorism is an issue
of growing concern and that brings us to the issue of the presence in Afghanistan
of bin Ladin and his network," Inderfurth said. "We did discuss that in
our meeting with the Taliban."

<p>As renewed fighting looms between the warring factions in Afghanistan,
the "Osama issue" may be of more than trivial concern to his Taliban hosts.
Rumors are rife that American commandos are already on the ground in Pakistan,
awaiting an order to move in on Osama. Such rumors are nothing new, popping
up now and then as a recurring theme in the Pakistani press. However the
question of Pakistani assistance to American counter-terrorist forces has
increasingly become a source of political and religious unrest in the country.
<p><b>Unrest in Pakistan over the "Osama issue"</b><br>The head of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's main
fundamentalist group, Qazi Hussain Ahmed, warned the Pakistani government of serious consequences
if it assisted the United States in the arrest of Osama bin
Ladin. Addressing a high level party meeting Qazi said, "Already the government
has created trouble for itself by agreeing to the Washington accord, and this
development would sound the death knell for it." He added, "We know that the
Nawaz has previously allowed the U.S. administration to interfere [in Afghanistan], violating
the territorial integrity of the two countries."
<p>Several other Islamic groups voiced similar fears, saying that the U.S.
was on the verge of launching an attack similar to that of last August, when cruise missiles were fired at
terrorist camps in Afghanistan from American ships.
<p>Pakistan's religious atmosphere is volatile at the best of times, with
sectarian violence ready to boil over at the
slightest provocation. In a country where Afghanistan's Taliban and its
adherents are regarded by some as Islamic heroes, the government
cannot afford to be seen as bowing to American pressure. There is considerable
popular support for bin Ladin in Pakistan, and this support could erupt
in anti-government violence should the government be seen to side with
the Americans against bin Ladin.
<p><b>Pakistani government denies presence of American forces</b>
<br>Interior Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain meanwhile denied the reports
that American commandos were in Pakistan and said that the Pakistani government
had no intentions of allowing its territory to be used as a staging ground
by the Americans.
<p>"This is a matter between the United States and Afghanistan," Hussain
said, adding that Pakistan would not allow the use of its territory "for
any action against Osama bin Ladin." Hussain also dismissed claims by some
religious leaders that a deal was struck over bin Ladin during Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's recent talks with President Clinton in Washington.
<p>Despite its strong Islamic identity, Pakistan has a long record of assisting
the United States to apprehend Islamic terrorists. Pakistan was instrumental
in the arrest of Ramzi Yousef, who orchestrated the bombing of the World
Trade Center in 1995. In 1997, the Pakistani government extradited Mir
Amal Kansi, who was convicted of killing CIA employees outside the agency's
headquarters in 1993. More recently, the arrest in Pakistan of Mohammed
Odeh provided the first direct clue to bin Ladin's role in the bombing
of the American embassies in East Africa. Odeh was extradited to the United
States and has since been indicted for his role in the bombings.
<p>A top Taliban source quoted by the Afghani paper <i>The News</i> was
doubtful of the ability of the Americans to find bin Ladin. He said that
Osama was constantly changing his hideouts and that it was difficult even
for the Afghans to know his whereabouts. "We only sense the signal of Osama's
movement through the alteration in the security arrangements," he said.
