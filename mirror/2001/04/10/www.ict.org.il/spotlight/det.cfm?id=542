<p><center><h2>Further Sanctions imposed on Taliban</h2></center>
<p><p>The U.N. Security Council has voted to impose further sanctions on Afghanistan's
Taliban due to the militia's refusal to hand over Osama bin Ladin for trial.
<p><b>Superpowers in agreement, others critical</b>
<br>In a rare show of unity, the United States and Russia together sponsored
the resolution to broaden the sanctions already in force. The resolution
passed by a vote of 13 to 0, with two abstentions.
<p>The U.S. and Russia share common concerns over the Taliban's support
of terrorism--particularly their endorsement of the Islamist militants
fighting the Russians in Chechnya and Osama bin Ladin's terrorist network,
which has set itself in opposition to both superpowers.
<p>However, several countries voiced criticism of the sanctions, saying
that the imposition of further restrictions on Afghanistan would only worsen
the plight of the war-torn country, now suffering through the worst drought
in decades. China and Malaysia abstained from the vote, on the grounds
that the sanctions would further isolate ordinary Afghanis.
<p>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan criticized the sanctions, saying they could hinder peace efforts as well as relief
aid in the war-torn nation. He was quoted by the Associated Press as saying,
"It is not going to facilitate peace efforts, nor is it going to facilitate
our humanitarian work."

<p>However, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs,
Karl Inderfurth said that the sanctions were aimed "only at the Taliban
leadership" and that they contain "broad exemptions to allow humanitarian
assistance for Afghans to continue unabated." Briefing reporters in Washington
four days ago, Indefurth noted that the United States contributed over
$100 million in the past year to relieving the suffering of the Afghan people.
<p><b>Sanctions to go into effect in 30 days</b>
<br>In October of 1999, the Security Council froze Taliban assets and imposed an
air embargo on Ariana airlines to force Taliban to hand over bin Laden. According
to a U.N. report, the air ban has slowed down delivery of some goods, cost jobs
 and jeopardized air safety on domestic flights because of a lack of spare parts.
<p>Inderfurth said that the Security Council was forced to seek new measures
"because of [the Taliban leaders'] support for terrorist organizations
and the fact that they allow terrorist training camps in Afghan territory."
The Taliban bases its refusal to surrender the Saudi-born militant on what
they say is the lack of any proof that he was involved in terrorist activities.
They have also denied that training camps in militia-held territory are
used to train Chechen rebels to fight against Russia.
<p>The measures aim to pressure the Taliban to close training camps within
30 days and expel bin Laden, who has been indicted in the U.S. for orchestrating
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa in Aug. 1998. The sanction
go into effect in 30 days if the Taliban does not comply. They lapse in
a year after which the council would have to vote to reimpose them.
<p>The new resolution limits travel by senior Taliban authorities, freezes
bin Ladin's and Taliban assets and orders the closure of Afghan Ariana
Airlines offices abroad. The sanction also impose an arms embargo against
the Taliban, including  foreign military assistance that from Pakistan.
<p>The arms embargo is somewhat unusual in that it does not apply to the
opposition Northern Alliance. The alliance, led by Gen. Ahmed
Shah Massoud now controls only 5% of Afghanistan, however its leaders
are recognized by the United Nations as the lawful government of Afghanistan.
Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have diplomatic
ties with the Taliban.
<p>In anticipation of the council's actions, the United Nations withdrew
its relief staff from Afghanistan, fearing a backlash to the sanctions.
