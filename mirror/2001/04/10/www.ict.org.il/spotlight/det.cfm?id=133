<p><center><h2>U.S. Embassy in Albania Closed</h2></center>
<p>

<P>The Washington Post reported that the American embassy in Albania has
been shut down and most of its employees flown out of the country after receiving “a serious threat
of a terrorist attack” (see<A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/albania_announce.html">
State Department Public Announcement</A>). The State Department has urgently
advised Americans in Albania to leave the country, as well as issuing a
<A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/albania_warning.html">travel warning</A>.

<P>Albania has recently been the scene of intense activity on the part
of American and Albanian intelligence against suspected Islamic militants.&nbsp;
In June of this year four suspected extremists were arrested in a crackdown
on individuals suspected of terrorist activities outside of Albania.&nbsp;
The men were described as Egyptian citizens suspected of involvement
in the terrorist activities of Saudi expatriate <A HREF="../articles/bin-ladin.htm">Osama
Bin Laden</A>. The men were eventually deported to Egypt where they were
wanted by the authorities.

<P>Recently, more suspected militants were arrested, also with the help
of American intelligence. According to the Washington Post, some of those
arrested may be affiliated with Bin Laden, while others are suspected of
belonging to the Egyptian <A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18">al-Jihad
group</A>. This group issued a statement several days prior to the embassy
bombings, threatening to avenge the arrests of its members in Albania.&nbsp;
The leader of a faction of the al-Jihad group has recently joined an umbrella
organization called “The Islamic World Front for the struggle against the Jews and the Crusaders”
(<I>Al-Jabhah al-Islamiyyah al-`Alamiyyah li-Qital al-Yahud wal-Salibiyyin</I>).

<P>The Front was declared in an announcement on February 1998 at a press
conference
<BR>in Pakistan. The announcement was made jointly by Saudi exiled millionaire
Osama bin Ladin, Dr. Ayman Zawahiri, one of the leaders of the Egyptian
Jihad in exile, Rifa`I Ahmad Taha, the leader of the Egyptian “<A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=12">Al-Gama`ah
al-Islamiyyah,</A>” Munir Hamzah the secretary of the Association of Pakistani
Clerics, Fadl al-Rahman Khalil the leader of “Al-Ansar Movement” in Pakistan,
and Sheikh Abd al-Salam Muhammad Khan the leader of the Jihad Movement
of Bangladesh.

<P>The declaration of the establishment of the Islamic Front was accompanied
by two Islamic Decrees (<I>Fatwah</I>) by Bin Ladin and “The Association
of Islamic Clerics in Afghanistan” (<I>Ittihad al-Ulama’ fi Afghanistan</I>),
declaring a religious war against the USA. The war was proclaimed a personal
religious duty upon every Muslim “to kill Americans and their allies, civilians
as well as army men, and steal their money wherever they are.”
