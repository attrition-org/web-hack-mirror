<p><center><h2>U.S. Court Indicts Five More in Embassy Bombings</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Five more fugitives suspected of links to the bombing of two U.S. embassies
in East Africa have been indicted by a U.S. district court. The five were
identified as Saif al Adel, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, Muhsin Musa Matwalli
Atwah, Ahmed Mohamed Hamed Ali, and Anas al Liby. All are currently fugitives.
<p><b>Senior al-Qaidah operatives indicted</b>
<br>All of the five are believed to be senior operatives of Osama bin Ladin's
al-Qaidah organization. All of the men were charged with conspiracy to
commit murder, kill U.S. citizens, commit terrorist acts and destroy U.S.
defense installations. The fifth man,  Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah is
the only one charged with an active role in the bombings.
<p>According to the indictment Abdullah was sent to Kenya during the first
week of August 1998 to coordinate the bombing of the American embassy in
Nairobi. There he allegedly met with at least three of those suspected
of having a direct role in the attack. One of those men was a passenger
in the truck carrying the bomb, while the other, identified only as "Azzam,"
was the alleged suicide bomber who died in the attack.
<p>According to the indictment, Abdullah left Kenya for Pakistan the day
before the attack. He is charged with 223 counts of murder, in addition
to the charges of conspiracy to commit terrorist attacks.
<p>All five men are also alleged to have been involved in training the
Somali tribesmen who attacked American military personnel during an operation
in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. According to the indictment, bin Ladin ordered
the men to Nairobi, Kenya following the Somali operation, in order to select
further American targets for attack.
<p>Anas al Liby, allegedly carried out reconnaissance and surveillance
of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in late 1993. He and Saif Al Adel, an Egyptian,
allegedly sat on a consultation council for Al Qaidah, where the targets
were discussed and approved.
<p>Said Adel and Muhsin Musa Matwalli Atwah are also charged with providing
military and intelligence training to bin Ladin's followers in Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Sudan.
<p><b>Suspect charged with attacking guard</b>
<br>The amended indictment also charges one of the defendants already in
custody, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, with conceiving and attempting to carry
out an escape plan. According to the new indictment, Salim interrupted
a meeting with his defense lawyers to request that he return to his cell
to retrieve some legal materials. Minutes later, Salim allegedly stabbed
his guard in the eye with a hair pick that had been filed down to a point.
The hair pick penetrated the guard's brain, and he has remained in critical
condition since the attack.
<p>Salim then allegedly handcuffed the guard, took his keys and, following
a plan outlined on notes later found in his cell, attempted to tamper with
an electrical junction box and block the lens of a surveillance camera
inside his cell. When other officers responded, Salim allegedly stabbed
one of them with another improvised weapon and sprayed them with irritants
fashioned from liquids obtained as food items.
<p>Notes later found in Salim's cell reportedly outlined an ambitious escape
plan. Entries referred to identifying keys, cutting off the electricity and the surveillance cameras.  There was also a note, apparently intended
to be used after hostages had been taken, which said "We have captured
the tenth flr. in the MCC and we have several lawyers and officials...if
the government worrys (sic) about the safty (sic) of its citizines (sic)
it has to comply with all our demands, otherwise, it will be responsible
for any consequences."
<p>The new charges lodged against Salim include conspiracy to take hostages,
conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assaults on federal officers, conspiracy
to escape, and possession of dangerous weapons in a prison facility. If
convicted of the charges, which are in addition to the terrorism allegations,
he would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Salim
pleaded not guilty to the additional allegations at a brief hearing.
<p><b>Awaiting trial</b>
<br>The addition of the five fugitive brings the total number of those
indicted to 22. Seventeen people were indicted earlier in the case, including
Osama bin Ladin himself and his top aides. Five of those previously indicted
are awaiting trial in New York, three are awaiting extradition from Britain
and eight remain at large. One man, Ali Mohamed, a former U.S. Army sergeant,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges on October 20 and is awaiting sentencing.
<p>The defendants awaiting trial are:
<ul>
<li>
Wadih el-Hage, a naturalized American, admitted that he served in the early
1990s as bin Ladin's personal secretary.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a Sudanese national, is charged with being one of
bin Laden's top financial officers. He reportedly attempted to procure
weapons of mass destruction for bin Ladin. He was extradited to the United
States from Germany after his arrest near Munich in late 1998.</li>

<li>
Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, a Jordanian national, is accused of planning and executing
the embassy attack in Nairobi.</li>

<li>
Mohamed Rashed al-'Owhali is accused of murder in connection with the Kenya
bombing. He has said that the attack was supposed to be a suicide mission,
and that he had not expected to survive the blast.</li>

<br>Khalfan Khamis Mohamed is the only defendant in custody charged with
a role in the parallel bombing of the American embassy in Tanzania.</ul>
The trial is set to begin on Jan. 3 in Manhattan federal court. Mamdouh
Mahmud Salim will not be tried with the others due to the additional charges
against him in connection with the attack on the prison guard.
