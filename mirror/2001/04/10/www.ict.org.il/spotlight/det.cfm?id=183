<p><center><h2>Terror Attack in Jerusalem</h2></center>
<p><IMG SRC="../graphics/car_bomb1.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=131 WIDTH=175 ALIGN=RIGHT>Two
people were killed and more than 20 injured in a terrorist attack in the
Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem. The blast occurred at 9:45 this morning
when the market was filled with weekend shoppers.&nbsp; Witnesses said
that a red Fiat car drove at speed into the crowded market and exploded.&nbsp;
Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki told Israel radio that one of
the dead was in the car, "apparently one of the terrorists," while the
identity of the other is being investigated.&nbsp; "We are currently investigating
whether we're dealing with a car bomb, or explosives being transported
in the car in order to be carried on foot into the center of the market."
Yitzhaki said.&nbsp; What is sure, he said, was that the attack was intended
to hit the market.

<P><IMG SRC="../graphics/car_bomb2.JPG" HEIGHT=167 WIDTH=213 ALIGN=LEFT>In
the Fiat 127, two suitcases were found containing a relatively small amount
of explosives.&nbsp; The bomb was described by security sources as "amateurish."&nbsp;
The attack occurred on Jaffa Road, close to the entrance to the market,
which was less densely crowded.&nbsp; Security sources have pointed out
that the damage would have been devastating had the explosion occurred
several dozen meters deeper into the market. "We were extremely lucky here,"
said the owner of one of the stands near the focus of the blasts.&nbsp;
Local hospitals reported that the majority of the injured were lightly
wounded.

<P>An anonymous caller took responsibility for the attack in the name of
Hamas. However, Israeli security sources said that the perpetrators belonged to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and not to Hamas. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the attack, calling it "an
attack on the interests of the Palestinians."&nbsp; The Israeli Cabinet,
which was meeting to discuss the Wye agreement disbanded on hearing news
of the attack.&nbsp; It isn't clear what effect the attack will have on
the implementation of the Wye agreements.
