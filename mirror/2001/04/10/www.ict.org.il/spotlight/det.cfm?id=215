<p><center><h2>PKK Leader Leaves Italy</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has unexpectedly
left Italy for an unknown destination. The Italian government has declined
to comment on where Ocalan was bound, saying only, "Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan, having decided to leave Italy, has been accompanied to the border."
Speculations in the Italian media that he was now in Moscow were met with
skepticism by a government official.
<p><b>"The conditions for asylum did not exist"</b>
<br>Abdullah Ocalan first appeared in Italy on November 12, 1998, where
he was arrested when he landed in Rome from Moscow on a false passport.
Ocalan is Turkey's most wanted man, held responsible by the government
for nearly 29,000 deaths in 14 years of fighting for a Kurdish state. In
Germany too, Ocalan is wanted on charges of terrorism.
<p>Italy rejected Turkey's request to extradite Ocalan, because Italian
law does not allow the extradition of suspects to countries where they
might face the death penalty--a scenario very likely in Ocalan's case.
Instead, negotiations were begun to try him on lesser charges in Germany.
The German government, however, rejected the proposal for fear of raising
tensions between Turkish and Kurdish ethnic groups in Germany.
<p>Last month the Italian government freed Ocalan from house arrest, a
move that caused further tensions between Italy and Turkey. The possibility
of an international trial had been raised, but rejected out of hand by
the Turkish government, apparently for fear that such a trial would bring
its own policies regarding the Kurdish question under scrutiny. Meanwhile,
Ocalan's request for asylum in Italy placed the Italian government in a
delimma--Ocalan is the head of an organization that is branded a terrorist
organization in several countries, including the United States.
<p>An Italian government spokesman said only that Ocalan had left at midday
on Saturday. "The conditions for asylum did not exist. Ocalan was in effect
a free man. He was free to leave," he said.
