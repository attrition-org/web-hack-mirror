<p><center><h2>Jordan Arrests Suspects in Terrorist Plot</h2></center>
<p><p>Jordanian security forces have arrested a group of eleven Jordanian nationals,
an Iraqi and an Algerian on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks. According
to Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Raouf al-Rawabdeh the group was returning
from Afghanistan, and "planned to carry out operations on the Jordanian
arena." Rawabdeh was speaking to the Jordanian parliament.
<p>Rawabdeh said that the suspects underwent military training in Afghanistan.
Their goal may have been the assassination of Jordanian officials. However, a second source reported that the group was plotting attacks on Christian pilgrimage sites in the Hashemite kingdom. They entered Jordan using false passports, and had a number of other forged passports in their possession. Three suspects were still being sought outside of Jordan. 

<p>Jordan had previously tightened border controls, after receiving foriegn
intelligence warning that Islamic militants trained in Afghanistan may
seek to use Jordan as a transit point to other countries in the region.
<p><b>Link to American travel warning</b>
<br>The arrests were linked to an American travel warning to its
citizens traveling abroad that terrorists could be seeking to target Americans.
The <a href="http://travel.state.gov/wwc_terrorist.html" target="_new">travel
warning</a> cited "credible evidence that terrorists are planning attacks
specifically targeting American citizens" over the New Year, which this
year coincides with the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
<p>The warning urged U.S. citizens traveling abroad to "avoid large crowds
and gatherings, keep a low profile, and vary routes and times of all required
travel." The travel warning did not single out a particular region, but
emphasized the global nature of the threat.
<p>However, State Department officials confirmed that the warning was prompted
by the arrest in a Middle Eastern country of a number of individuals said
to be plotting terrorist attacks against Americans. Several of those arrested
had definite links to bin Ladin's organization, and were said to be planning
to target Christian targets in Jerusalem or Rome over the New Year holiday.
