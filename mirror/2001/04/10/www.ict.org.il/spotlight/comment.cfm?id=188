<P>This news is interesting from one particular aspect: it may shed some
light on the identity of Hamas’s central religious authorities. Whether
the information is true or is part of psychological warfare between Hamas
and the PA, it does indicate that the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood is providing
Hamas with its spiritual and religious guidance. According to the information
above, the PA used the term <i>Marja’iyyah</I> to denote "the highest source of
religious guidance." This term is used primarily by the Shi’ite Muslims,
and its use here may stem from the Palestinian Authority's accusations against 
Iran as being another
source of authority and guidance for Hamas.

<P>The Palestinian Islamic movement has never actually possessed supreme religious 
figures of its own, who could support the movement
in issues of crucial social and political importance.  Rather, the movement
has traditionally been connected to religious figures in Saudi Arabia,
the Gulf states and Jordan. Furthermore, until now it had not been clear
which of those countries was home to Hamas’s most influential religious guidance. 
The influence may actually be split--with religious guidance coming from an
 Islamic "supreme court" in Jordan, while organizational guidance comes from 
the Gulf states. It should be mentioned
that the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood in the West Bank was an instrument
of the Jordanian movement all the way up to the establishment of Hamas
in December 1987. There are many signs indicating that the movement is
still part of the Jordanian sister movement--at least on the socio-political
level of <I>Da’wah</I>, their public activity.
