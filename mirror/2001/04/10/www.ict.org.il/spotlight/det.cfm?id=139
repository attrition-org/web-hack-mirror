<p><center><h2>Details Emerge of Network behind Nairobi Bombing</h2></center>
<p><B>Raids on hotels</B>
<BR>The confession of Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, the main suspect in the bombings
of the American embassies in East Africa, may help to unravel a number
of unsolved cases involving terrorism. Odeh reportedly gave Pakistani interrogators
a detailed account of an international terrorist network whose activities--orchestrated
and financed by Osama bin Ladin--are aimed at American interests worldwide.
Odeh's arrest is being heralded as the turning-point in the investigation.

<P>Based on information given by Odeh to his Pakistani captors, American
and Kenyan investigators descended on a hotel in Nairobi where the bomb
is thought to have been constructed.&nbsp; The raid, which was conducted
Tuesday morning, centered on two rooms of the Hilltop Lodge, where four
men--two Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi Arabian--reportedly stayed
from August 3 to August 7, the day of the bombing.&nbsp; The hotel's manager
was arrested and the guest register confiscated.&nbsp; The Kenyan newspaper
<I>The Nation</I> reported that the bomb, which used 800 kilograms of TNT,
was assembled in rooms 102 and 107 of the hotel over a period of three
days, then moved to a closed pick-up truck for transport to the embassy.

<P>On the same day as the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Odeh was
detained upon arrival from Nairobi at Karachi international airport.&nbsp;
He was arrested for attempting to enter Pakistan on a forged Yemeni passport,
and&nbsp; for trying to bribe officials to release him. According to Pakistani
sources, Odeh willingly gave a detailed account of his role in the in Nairobi
bombing, claiming that he had provided technical, engineering and logistical
support.&nbsp; He is reportedly a Palestinian engineer, born in Jordan,
whose marriage to a Kenyan woman and familiarity with Nairobi, as well
as his command of English qualified him for the mission.

<P>The <I>Washington Post </I>reported that Odeh claimed to have been one
of seven operatives in Nairobi.&nbsp; They were sent, he said, by Osama
bin Laden, the exiled Saudi financier and sponsor of terrorism. According
to <I>The Nation </I>it was believed that three of the terrorists died
in the suicide bombing and two others are still at large.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B>A glimpse of bin Ladin's private army</B>
<BR>The <I>Washington Post</I> reported that Pakistani officials, on condition
of anonymity, agreed to share their notes on Odeh's interrogation with
<I>Post</I> reporters. According Odeh's testimony, bin Ladin commands what
is virtually a private army of between 4,000 to 5,000 men.&nbsp; His constituency
is comprised of Muslim militants from all over the Arab world, with many
still operating under his auspices in their home countries. Odeh described
bin Laden as possessing a large arsenal of conventional weapons--mortars,
surface-to-air missiles, rockets and tanks.

<P>Odeh explained how operatives are deployed in military actions under
a scheme of compartmentalization. Participants in each operation are kept
in the dark regarding other parallel actions for reasons of operational
secrecy. According to Odeh, American personnel and installations are the
primary target of the network's operations. He said the organization has
operatives in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia,
as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan.&nbsp; Although most of Odeh's testimony
cannot as yet be independently verified, it ties in well with what is already
known of bin Ladin's operations.<B></B>

<P><B>Past incidents linked to bin Ladin</B>
<BR>According to the <I>Washington Post</I> report, Odeh's confession threw
light on a number of past terrorist incidents in which bin Ladin was suspected.&nbsp;
Among these attacks were the guerilla raids against American troops in
Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, which killed 18 U.S. servicemen.&nbsp; Odeh
claimed to have actually taken part in these raids, which were long suspected
of being supported by bin Ladin.&nbsp; He and a group of guerrillas remained
in Somalia aiding clan leader Mohammed Farah Aideed for a full year, and
"considered the humiliation of U.S. troops there a major victory."

<P>Odeh also gave details of the assassination of a Palestinian Islamist,
Sheikh Abdulla Azzam, who died in a car bomb along with his two sons in
Peshawar in 1989. Odeh claimed that bin Ladin ordered the killing because
he suspected Azzam had ties to the CIA.

<P>Odeh gave no concrete details concerning the bombing of American bases
in Riyadh and Dhahran in 1995 and 1996 that killed 24 Americans.&nbsp;
Bin Ladin is suspected of masterminding both of these attacks.&nbsp; However,
neither has provided much in the way of evidence, and they have remained
unresolved to this day.&nbsp; Odeh did say that bin Ladin's network employs
"an especially large number of members in Saudi Arabia."&nbsp; He reportedly&nbsp;
implied that they had been involved in the two attacks on U.S. military
compounds there.&nbsp; He said that he was not familiar with the team that
carried out the bombings.

<P><B>Americans warned to leave Pakistan</B>
<BR>Although Odeh has so far not repeated his confession to the American
and Kenyan investigators, the investigators do not doubt that most of the
story he told Pakistani interrogators is essentially accurate.&nbsp; The
<I>Washington Post</I> report quoted Pakistani sources as saying that Odeh
"was aware that his on-the-record admission of anti-U.S. guerilla operations
would take him to the gallows."&nbsp; The sources said that the Pakistanis
had promised Odeh that his testimony would not be given to the Americans.&nbsp;
In fact, technically, Odeh was turned over to the Kenyans, rather that
to the Americans, although U.S. agents aided in his transfer and play a
central role in the continuing investigation.

<P>Apparently, Odeh's testimony is detailed enough to be considered grounds
for a number of actions by the U.S. State Department.&nbsp; The American
embassy in Islamabad has been partially evacuated and all non-essential
American personnel ordered to leave Pakistan. A travel warning was issued
by the State Department urging people to avoid travel to Pakistan. The
<I>Nando Times</I> quoted embassy workers who said that "there's something
different about the latest U.S. warning to get out." Some were amazed at
the speed with which the U.S. was working to remove its staff.&nbsp; U.S.
Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said that all but about 50 of 120 people
in the embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar
were leaving.

<P>Such precipitous action sparked local rumors that the Americans were
preparing to "go after" bin Ladin.&nbsp; However, State Department officials
have stressed that the evacuation was the result of "a pattern of threats"
of possible terrorist action against Americans, and was not brought on
solely by Odeh's arrest.

<P>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, during her recent visit
to Nairobi, urged the Taliban to expel Osama bin Ladin.&nbsp; The Taliban
is a fundamentalist Muslim militia that now controls most of Afghanistan.&nbsp;
She stressed that if the Taliban wishes ties with the U.S. and American
recognition of the movement as the rightful government of Afghanistan,
it must "stop harboring those considered terrorists." Concerning bin Ladin
she said, "whatever the connection to [the embassy bombings], I have said
previously that his funding of terrorism is something that the world is
quite aware of."&nbsp; Bin Ladin, who has close ties--both ideological
and financial-- with the Taliban, is reported to be in hiding in the mountains
near the Afghan city of Kandahar.

<P><B>Clues to bin Ladin's whereabouts</B>
<BR>Ironically, the latest information as to bin Ladin's whereabouts have
come from Iran.&nbsp; On August 13, 1998, IRNA, the official Iranian press
agency published a report describing bin Ladin's visit to the town of Mazar-e
Sharif, in northern Afghanistan.&nbsp; Bin Ladin reportedly "arrived at
the Shadian quarter of Maar-e Sharif in a Datsun pickup truck, escorted
by a large number of Taliban militia."&nbsp; The report went on to say
that after inspecting the city, which had recently been captured by the
Taliban, bin Ladin was to travel to Shebarghan.

<P>This report gives the impression that the Iranians are eager to "assist"
the Americans in locating bin Ladin.&nbsp; The explanation of this sudden
helpfulness on the part of Iran is not hard to decipher. Iran has been
considered a potential culprit in the Dhahran bombing, and may perceive
the implication of bin Ladin as a step toward proving its own noninvolvement
in that attack. In addition, the Taliban recently took eleven Iranian diplomats
hostage, and is threatening to try them as spies. Relations have between
tense between the Sunni Moslem Taliban and the predominantly Shi'ite Moslem
Iran since the militia became a power in the region.
