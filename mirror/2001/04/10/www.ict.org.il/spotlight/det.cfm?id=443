<p><center><h2>Suicide Terrorist Operations in Chechnya: an escalation in the Islamist struggle</h2></center>
<p>
<p><b>Reuven Paz</b>
<br><b>ICT Academic Director</b>
<p>The past weeks have witnessed an escalation of the situation in Chechnya,
with the start of a new phase of Islamist terrorism and guerrilla warfare
through two suicide operations. This marked the first time this <i>Modus
Operandi</i> was used in Chechnya by Islamist rebels.
<p><b>Suicide operations in Chechnya</b>
<br>On June 7<sup>th</sup> two suicide bombers—an unknown man and a young
Chechen Muslim woman by the name Hawaa’ Barayev—blew up a truck loaded
with explosives at a checkpoint on the grounds of the Omsk elite OMON (Russian
Special Forces) unit at Alkhan-Yurt in Chechnya.
<p>According to official Russian information agencies the operation caused
the death of two policemen, while five others were wounded. The truck crashed
through a perimeter fence and stopped outside a building where the elite
unit was housed. After the explosion, the building was fired at from a
nearby forest. This means that other rebels watched the suicide bombers,
and may hint at the possibility that the explosives were blown up by remote
control rather than by the suicide bombers themselves.
<p><b>“A message to the Muslims”</b>
<br>It should be noted that the official website of the rebels (<a href="http://www.qoqaz.net/">www.qoqaz.net</a>),
affiliated with the website of Osama bin Laden and his supporters (<a href="http://www.azzam.org/">www.azzam.org</a>)
claimed that the operation was carried out only by Barayev, and caused
the death of 27 Russian elite soldiers. Barayev was a cousin of Arbi Barayev,
one of the prominent rebel field commanders.
<p>The rebels noted that the operation was a message meant not only for
the Russians but “a message to the Muslims” as well. “It was a cry that
said no to the crimes against the Muslim Ummah, but will the people of
the Ummah heed to this call and rush to support their brothers and sisters
who are in need? Will the hearts of the believers come alive with this
example of pure faith and courageous sacrifice?”
<p><b>A rash of bombings</b>
<br>On June 11th a former Russian soldier, who converted to Islam and joined
the Islamist Chechen rebels, carried out another suicide operation at a
checkpoint in Khankala. The soldier, named by the Islamist rebels as Abdul
Rahman detonated a vehicle filled with explosives only a few minutes after
a federal convoy had passed through the checkpoint. The checkpoint itself
was destroyed and two OMON senior sergeants were killed in the operation.
<p>According to ITAR-TASS, the main Russian information agency, the driver
was named Sergey Dimitriyev, and upon his conversion to Islam he adopted
the name Jabrail. He was a fighter in the detachment of field commander
Mazman Akhmadov and came to Chechnya in early 1999, where he received military
training at “Khattab’s school of sabotage.” He set off the device when
asked to allow inspection of the car.
<p>On June 12<sup>th</sup> rebel forces in Grozny, the Chechen capital,
under the command of Ramadan Akhmadov, succeeded in planting explosives
in an army vehicle without the knowledge of the Russian soldier who drove
it. The vehicle blew up at an army position. An additional explosion occurred
on the first of June at an army base in Volgograd on June 1<sup>st</sup>.
<p>To date, as was the case with the explosions of civilian houses in Moscow
in September 1999, no one has taken responsibility for the attack. It seems
that the rebels are cautious not to admit any terrorist activity outside
of Chechnya, in order to preserve their image as guerrilla warriors and
freedom fighters rather than terrorists.
