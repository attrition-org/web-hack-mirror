<p><center><h2>The Muslim Brotherhood/Hamas on Osama bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<P>On September 22<SUP>nd</SUP> 1998 the Islamic weekly <I>Al-Sabeel</I>
the organ of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood (and of the Palestinian Brotherhood
and Hamas) published, an article on Osama bin Laden. This article is interesting
in that it represents the first time the Brotherhood mentions bin Ladin.
It was written by Yasser al-Za`atrah, the editor of the monthly <I>Filastin
al-Muslimah</I>, published in the United Kingdom as the main organ of Hamas,
and therefore reflects the view of the Palestinian Brotherhood as well.

<P><B>Yasser al-Za`atrah, <I>Al-Sabeel</I>, 22 September, 1998, p. 20.</B>

<P><B><I>Translation by Reuven Paz - ICT</I></B>

<P>In the last weeks there has been much said on the subject of terrorism
and the story of Osama bin Ladin, who is implicated in the two bombings
in Nairobi and Dar al-Salam. But the Western and Arab Media has concentrated
only on the term “Terrorism,” and has presented bin Ladin as the counterpart
of every professional killer extent in the American and European urban
societies. They totally ignore the political dimension in his message and
emphasize the kind of indiscriminate terrorism that has no message besides
murder for murder’s sake.&nbsp;

<P>The truth is that--without either accepting or disputing his views--his
few interviews to the press have reflected a clear political message. He
stated his opposition to the United States for two reasons. One is its
military presence in his homeland Saudi Arabia, and the second is its support
for the Zionist occupation of the holy places in Palestine. He has never
spoken for instance of killing Europeans, although he used the term “Crusaders”
that exists in the name of the organization started by bin Ladin and others:
“The World Front for the Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders,” and
this phrase includes Europeans or others.

<P>We should point out in the case of Bin Ladin that the new trend of his
thoughts has been a result of the Gulf war and the end of the role that
he and his colleagues played in the Afghan war. It reflects his wish to
continue the Jihad, especially while he denies the view that the Arab regimes
as heretical ones, and the struggle against the regime in his country.
He has never propounded this view and aims his criticism only at the American
presence in his homeland.

<P>What about the others around Osama bin Ladin?

<P>First of all, the man has no armies as described by Western media, merely
a few supporters, most of them persecuted Egyptians who could not find
safe haven and have no choice but to continue as they began. If not for
them, he may have succeeded in his efforts to leave Afghanistan and return
to his homeland.

<P>Those Egyptians too, did not intend to fight the United States, or if
they did it was a result of its aid to the Egyptian authorities in capturing
their colleagues. Moreover, there is still a dispute in their ranks on
the effectiveness of opening such a foreign front, whose price may be too
high.

<P>There is nothing new in saying that there is a good deal of motivation
for operations against the United States because of its record of persecuting
Muslims and supporting the Zionists. It means also that a struggle against
it may gain a lot of popularity, especially when the horizons of action
against the ruling Arab regimes are closed and the leaders of the violent
tendencies tended to see no efficacy for this mode of operation.

<P>The issue that should be dealt with here is the two sides of this war--the
United States on the one hand, and the factions that act against it, whether
Osama bin Ladin and those who surround him, or others, present or future,
on the other hand.

<P>Madeleine Albright has described the war against them as the war of
the future. This description reflects the perception of the nature of the
war against the United States in the period of cheap and easy terrorism.
The Israeli newspaper <I>Ha’aretz</I> has quoted an ex-official in the
CIA who said: “Nowadays there is no need for offices and state-sponsored
training camps to carry out an operation. A computer and a modem is sufficient
to build a terrorist group. When the means are at hand and there are convenient
circumstances like in Africa, which is considered to be safe for the American
presence there, it is enough to find the right motive and operate.”

<P>These advances in the technology of operations, and the prospect of
the use of chemical and biological weapons, means that the counter fight
is going to be hard and complicated. It may include counter terrorism against
innocent people, as happened in the case of the two attacks in the Sudan
and Afghanistan.

<P>This kind of criminal killing will naturally lead only to more violence,
which may take an individualistic nature, against American interests and
citizens in various places.&nbsp;
