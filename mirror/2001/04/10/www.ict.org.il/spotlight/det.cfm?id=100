<p><center><h2>Suspects in World Trade Center Bombing Arrested in Thailand</h2></center>
<p>
<P>Four Pakistanis apparently linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing
have been arrested by Thai police in Bangkok.&nbsp; According to the English-language
newspaper, "The Nation", the men were arrested by Thai Immigration Police
in cooperation with the FBI. The four - Mohamad Rahim,&nbsp; Hadja Pahu
Sasa,&nbsp; Hara Haj Husem, and Hareef Husen - were reportedly arrested
on a tip from Interpol.&nbsp; The 1993 World Trade Center bombing killed
six people and injured more than 1,000. So far six men have been convicted
in the United States in the past 4 years in connection with the attack.

<P>A security official in Bangkok,&nbsp; reportedly told "The Nation" that
the men were not only linked to the World Trade Center blast, but were also
suspected of plotting attacks on US embassy personnel in Bangkok. However,
the Associated Press quotes the head of Thailand's Immigration Police,
Lt. Gen Chidchai Vanasatidya, as denying that the four were planning an
attack on the U.S. embassy. The U.S. is expected to ask for their extradition
to stand trial for terrorist activities.
