<p><center><h2>Turkish
Court Sentences Ocalan to Death</h2></center>
<p><p>Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death by
a three-member panel of judges on charges of treason today on the Turkish
island of Imrali. The Turks hold Ocalan responsible for the deaths of 37,000
people as a result of his 15-year battle for Kurdish separatism.
<p>In his final statement just before sentence was pronounced, Ocalan again
appealed for the chance to work for peace between his organization and
the Turkish government. "I do not accept the treason charges," he said.
"I am trying to correct historical mistakes."
<p><b>The long road to trial</b>
<br>Last year Ocalan was forced out of his refuge in Syria when Turkey
threatened military action. Syria signed a <a href="../Articles/syria-turkey.htm">treaty</a>
with Turkey promising not to allow the PKK leader back into Syria. From
Damascus Ocalan made his way to Russia before moving on to Rome where he
filed an application for asylum. His presence in Italy caused a serious
diplomatic breach between Rome and Ankara. He left Italy, apparently of
his own will on January 16.
<p>Since then he had been on the run from one European capital to the next.
On the first of February he was refused entry into the Netherlands where
he reportedly wanted to take his peoples' case to the International Court
of Arbitration. After being shunted from one airport to another, he was
finally granted landing clearance at a Greek airport, apparently on the
island of Corfu. There his plane was refueled and he was sent on to Kenya.
<p>Greece is a traditional supporter of the Kurdish struggle for independence,
and has repeatedly been accused by Turkey of giving aid to the PKK. Athens
refused Ocalan's request for asylum, but offered him refuge in a Greek
diplomatic compound in Kenya. He was spirited out of Kenya by a team of
Turkish commandos sent to abduct him. For weeks after his arrest, accusations
were exchanged between Kenya and Greece as to who was responsible for his
being handed over to the Turks.
<p><b>"Blood will flow in Turkey"</b>
<br>Throughout his trial, which began on May 31, Ocalan had called on the
Ankara government to negotiate with the PKK for a peaceful and democratic
solution to the Kurdish problem. Turkish authorities have, at least publicly,
refused to negotiate with the PKK. Ocalan warned that his execution would
embroil Turkey in a bloodbath, as Kurdish separatists took the law into
their own hands. "Thousands of people will start the terror
machine for me," he warned.
<p>Turkish security forces have been on the alert for several
weeks against the possibility of terrorist attacks motivated by Ocalan's
trial and sentencing. The judges verdict was widely expected. Police in
European capitals have also tightened security. Ocalan's capture in February
sparked a wave of violent Kurdish protests all over the world.</font>
<p>The death sentence will not be carried out immediately
as under Turkish law the sentence is subject to automatic appeal. If the
Court of appeal passes the death sentence, then the sentence will need
to be voted upon in parliament. In the event that the Turkish parliament
confirms the death sentence, Ocalan could still appeal to the European
Court of Human Rights. The process of appeal could take from six months
to a year.
<p>Although no death sentence has actually been carried out
in Turkey since 1984, popular pressure is strong in support of hanging
Ocalan.</font>
