<p><center><h2>PKK Leader Arrested in Rome</h2></center>
<p>

<P>Italian Police have arrested Abdulla Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish separatist
movement as he attempted to enter Italy on a false passport. Ocalan faces
extradition to Turkey, where he has been sought by security forces for
nearly 20 years.&nbsp; According to the Turkish Daily News, the separatist
leader entered Italy at the invitation of the Italian Communist parties
and the ERNK, the political branch of the PKK. He had been in Russia for
the past month, since being forced to leave his former refuge in Damascus
under the conditions of a recent <A HREF="../articles/syria-turkey.htm" target=_new>treaty</A>
between Turkey and Syria.

<P>Ocalan was detained last Thursday night on arrival at Rome's Leonardo
da Vinci airport from Moscow. Airport authorities were suspicious of his
passport, which later turned out to be forged. He was arrested by special
police on the basis of international warrants from Germany and Turkey.

<P><B>Revolutionary on the run</B>
<BR>Abdulla Ocalan is a controversial figure; regarded as a hero to many
Kurds, he is considered a terrorist and murderer by the Turkish government.&nbsp;
Ocalan, also known as Apo, is considered the main architect of Kurdish
nationalism in Turkey. He has lead the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in
its fight against the Turkish government for nearly 20 years, and has been
on the run from the Turkish authorities for almost as long.

<P>Ocalan was born to a farming family in the village of Omerli near the
Turkish-Syrian border. He became politically active during his university
years in Ankara, where he studied political science. In 1978, while still
a student, he founded the Marxist-Leninist PKK. The organization has since
waged an armed battle for the creation of an independent Kurdish state
in south-east Turkey as a home for Kurds from Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq.

<P>The conflict has been a particularly bloody one, with neither side giving
quarter. Civil rights organizations estimate that between 30,000 to 37,000
people have died on both sides, many of them civilians. The PKK is listed
as a terrorist organization by a number of Western countries, including
Britain and the United States.

<P><B>Hard times for the PKK</B>
<BR>The PKK has suffered major setbacks in the past year. Turkish troops
have carried out frequent raids in northern Iraq against PKK bases, as
well as a series of controversial covert operations against PKK members
in Turkey and elsewhere. One of Ankara's major successes on the diplomatic
front resulted in the PKK being put on the U.S. State Department's list
of terrorist organizations.

<P>As its military options have grown fewer, the separatist group has become
more political.&nbsp; On September 1, the PKK declared a ceasefire, claiming
that it would no longer attack Turkish government installations and would
fight only if attacked.

<P>Last month Turkey signed a treaty with Syria under which Syria agreed
to withdraw its support of the PKK and oust the group's fighters from their
basis in the Syrian-controlled Beka'a Valley in Lebanon.&nbsp; The PKK
had often launched raids into southeast Turkey from Syrian territory. Syria
also agreed to oust Abdullah Ocalan from Damascus, with the result that&nbsp;
the PKK leader moved on to Moscow.

<P><B>Extradition a delicate issue for Italy</B>
<BR>Ankara has requested that Ocalan's by extradited from Italy to Turkey,
where he faces trial on a number of charges, including murder and incitement
to murder. This has already sparked controversy in Italy, due to the legal
and political issues involved.&nbsp; Italy does not itself use the death
penalty, nor does it extradite suspects to countries where they are likely
to face the death penalty.

<P>The charges facing Ocalan in Turkey--leading a terrorist organization,
threatening the country's territorial integrity and ordering killings--are
severe enough to bring the death penalty. Although Turkey has not executed
anyone since 1984,&nbsp; Italy could refuse to extradite Ocalan if there
were even a risk of capital punishment.

<P>Yet another question is whether or not Ocalan has requested political
asylum in Italy. Although Italian authorities have so far refused to comment
on the matter, the PKK's European branch said that Ocalan requested political
asylum. If true, his extradition to Turkey could be problematic, because
Italy's constitution prohibits extraditing a person accused of political
crimes.

<P>One possible way out of the dilemma might be for Italy to extradite
Ocalan to Germany, where he is wanted on the basis of PKK attacks against
Turkish interests in Germany. Since these are criminal charges not carrying
the death penalty, the legal issues are much simplified. Whatever action
Italy takes is bound to create controversy due to the charged political
aspects of the Kurdish question.
