<p><center><h2>Yemen Names Suspects in Cole Bombing</h2></center>
<p><p>Investigators in Yemen say they hold six suspects in the bombing of
the USS Cole. All six are said to be Yemeni veterans of the Afghan war
against the Soviets.
<p>The main suspect was identified as Jamal al-Badawi. He told investigators
that he received instructions for the bombing by telephone from a man in
the United Arab Emirates, following which, he rented safe houses
and coordinated the plotters' activities up until the bombing on October
12.
<p>Two of the suspects, Walid al-Sourouri and Fatha Abdul Rahman, were
police officials from the town of Lahej. They are suspected of providing
the false documentation and other papers used by the bombers. Less is known
about the other three suspects, named as Yasser al-Azzani, Jamal Ba Khosh
and Ahmad al-Shinni. Ba Khosh may have been recruited to videotape the
attack, although the tape was apparently never made.
<p>Yemeni officials say the two suicide bombers were born in Saudi Arabia,
but had family ties in the Yemeni province of Hadhramaut, the ancestral
home of Osama bin Ladin. They, like bin Ladin himself, were veterans of the Afghan
conflict. According to the Yemeni Interior Minister, one of the bombers had 
been arrested for plotting a terrorist attack in Yemen
in 1999, shortly after he returned from a visit to Afghanistan. He and
15 others served short terms in prison and were released.
<p><b>Trial set for January</b>
<br>The Yemeni government announced that it intends to try the suspects
it holds in January. However FBI officials and the American
Embassy in Sana'a have appealed to Yemen to delay the trial. The Americans
fear the Yemenis will close the investigation without following up all
the evidence.
<p>Some have hinted that some of the evidence could prove embarrassing
to the Yemeni government. Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh has consolidated his rule by absorbing into his government
a number of men whose past is not unlike that of the bombers themselves.
In an interview with the American magazine Newsweek, President Saleh described
such speculation as "weak
stories aimed to create trouble with the U.S. side."
<p>American
investigators say that the Yemeni authorities have been less than totally
cooperative in sharing the results of the investigation with their American
colleagues. The FBI only won the right to sit in on interrogations and
pose questions of their own on November 29. The FBI says that cooperation
has since improved.
<p>There is
little chance that any of the suspects will be extradited to the United
States, as the Yemeni constitution prohibits such extraditions.
<p><b>Key suspect still at large</b>
<br>The Yemeni authorities say that their role in the investigation will
be over as soon as they have rounded up all the Yemeni suspects in the
bombing. It will then be up to the U.S. to follow up the leads to the bombers'
foreign contacts. One such foreign link is Mohammed Omar al-Harazi.
<p>Al-Harazi--who also goes by the aliases "Abu al-Mohsin" and "Abu al-Hassan"--was
identified by Jamal al-Badawi as the man who directed the bombing, phoning instructions
from the United Arab Emirates and putting up the money for safe houses,
explosives and vehicles.
<p>Al-Harazi is said to be a Saudi citizen born to a Yemeni family in Saafan,
a village in the Haraz Mountains about 55 miles west of Sana'a.  He
lived in Afghanistan for a time and reportedly traveled extensively between
Aden and the United Arab Emirates in the months leading up to the bombing.
He apparently left Aden four days before the attack.
<p><b>Bin Ladin link suspected, but unconfirmed</b>
<br>The planning and execution of the bombing of the USS Cole appears similar
to previous attacks linked to Osama bin Ladin's network. In particular,
the use of small compartmentalized cells, who receive their instructions
from persons unknown to them is typical of al-Qaidah's mode of operation.
However, so far the only links to bin Ladin are circumstantial--the operational
methods and the fact that the plotters were Afghan veterans, who shared bin 
Ladin's particular interpretation of Islam.
<p>Al-Badawi told his interrogators that he was given the impression by
al-Harazi that the money for the attack was coming from bin Ladin, although
al-Harazi never actually confirmed this.
<p>The Associated Press reported that a composite sketch of one of the
suicide bombers appears to match that of a man wanted for questioning in
the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. If the identification
is proved this will support, but not confirm, the involvement of bin Ladin
in the bombing of the USS Cole.
<p>Interior Minister Hussein Arab was quoted by the UAE paper <i>Al-Bayan</i>
as saying that the attack was "prepared and planned in Yemen since 1997."
An earlier attack on the US warship <i>The Sullivans</i> was planned for
3 January 1999. The attack failed when a boat laden with explosives sank
in Aden harbor before it could reach its target.
