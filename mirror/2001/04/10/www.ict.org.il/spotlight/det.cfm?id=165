<p><center><h2>Investigation Closes in on bin Ladin's East Africa Network</h2></center>
<p>

<P>American efforts to strike against Osama bin Ladin's worldwide terror
network have begun to bear fruit. These efforts are by no means confined
to the military sphere; rather, the most significant gains have been in
the sphere of intelligence and international cooperation.

<P><B>Eighteen arrested in plot to bomb the U.S. embassy</B>
<BR>In Uganda, police are holding 18 people suspected of belonging to bin
Ladin's network. According to the Uganda government-owned paper <I>New
Vision</I>, two of the men were described by local security officials as
being involved in the planning of the bombings of American embassies in
Nairobi and Tanzania. Eighteen others--eight Ugandans and ten Somalis--were
arrested on September 17th and 18th on a tip from American intelligence
sources.

<P>The men are suspected of planning an attack on the American embassy
in Kampala. According to the New Vision, this was to have been a devastating
attack involving a one-ton bomb, twice as powerful as the one used in Nairobi.
The police reportedly seized a large quantity of explosives and a dump
truck that was to have carried the bomb to the embassy.

<P>Unidentified sources quoted by the paper said that the attack was supported
by Sudan, “Sudan wanted to retaliate for the U.S. missile strikes in August
with devastation bomb explosions in Kampala.” Reportedly British embassies
were also to have been targeted by the group.

<P><B>Cracks in the bin Ladin network</B>
<BR>The arrests reportedly resulted from a series of serious errors in
tradecraft on the part of bin Ladin’s operatives. American intelligence
learned of the plot against the embassies in Kampala and warned Ugandan
authorities that two of bin Ladin’s agents were on their way to Uganda.
The two were caught by Ugandan security as they attempted to enter the
country using false passports.

<P>These arrests led to others, as those arrested told police of other
operatives living in Kampala and surrounding areas. The lack of compartmentalization
meant that each operative had detailed knowledge of the group’s plans and
of one another’s whereabouts. Several of those arrested were even caught
with written material concerning the group’s activities. One of those arrested,
Ugandan businessman Ahamed Mandela, is the financial secretary of the Tawud
Association, a Muslim charity.

<P>According to American intelligence sources quoted by the <I>San Jose
Mercury News</I>, bin Ladin’s east African operations were first established
by Ghazi Salah al-Din, currently a Sudanese minister of information and
culture. He reportedly worked with bin Ladin for six years, both in Afghanistan
and in Sudan to set up a network in East Africa based on funding by bin
Ladin.

<P><B>International cooperation leads to more arrests</B>
<BR>A number of other arrests of bin Ladin operatives in Europe and the
United States shows that the extent of the American investigation into
bin Ladin’s East African group. However the investigation did not start
with the bombings of the U.S. embassy. American intelligence had reportedly
been tracking bin Ladin’s Kenyan cell since 1996 and had been monitoring
the activities of Osama bin Ladin at least since the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993.

<P>But the East Africa embassy bombings--and the continuous stream of threats
from bin Ladin to carry out additional attacks--were what leant a sense
of urgency to the investigations. This sense of urgency has ironically
brought about a significant increase in international cooperation, as more
and more countries begin cracking down on international terrorists.

<P>Recent successes in rounding up bin Ladin’s operatives worldwide have
provided a glimpse into the methods and motivations of what was up until
a few months ago a little-known terrorist organization. Among those arrested
so far are:
<UL><B>Mohammed Sadiq Odeh</B>
<BR>Odeh was detained at Karachi international airport on the day of the
embassy bombings when he to enter Pakistan on a forged Yemeni passport.
He gave his Pakistani interrogators a detailed account of his role in the
in Nairobi bombing, claiming that he was one of seven operatives in Nairobi
and that he provided technical, engineering and logistical support. He
is reportedly a Palestinian engineer, born in Jordan, who met bin Ladin
in 1990 in Afghanistan and was sent to Kenya in 1994 to attack U.S. interests
in Africa.

<P><B>Mohammed Rashid Dauod al Owhali</B>
<BR>Al-Owhali was arrested in Nairobi on the day of the bombing. He was
a passenger on the truck carrying the bomb and expected to die in the explosion.
He was one of the men spotted filming the embassy several days before the
bombing, and was also identified as the man who tossed a grenade at the
embassy guards. Al-Owhali gave the FBI a detailed confession, in which
he said that had been trained in explosives, hijacking and kidnapping in
training camps in Afghanistan affiliated with al-Qaida.

<P><B>Mahmdouh Mahmud Salim</B>
<BR>Salim, described as a high-ranking lieutenant in bin Ladin’s network
was arrested in Germany by anti-terrorist police on a tip from American
intelligence. He is accused of being one of the founders of al-Qaida, and
one of bin Ladin’s top aides who helped finance, train and arm its members.
Salim managed terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the
Sudan for al-Qaida and reportedly attempted to obtain non-conventional
weapons, including components for nuclear weapons.

<P><B>Whadi el-Hage</B>
<BR>El Hage, a U.S. citizen residing in Texas reportedly served at one
time as bin Ladin’s personal secretary during his exile in Sudan. He has
been charged with lying to the FBI about his connections with al-Qaida,
but evidence uncovered in Nairobi indicates that he may also have been
involved in the embassy bombings.</UL>


<P><B>Arrests in England</B>
<BR>Meanwhile, in a joint action between anti-terrorist police officers
from Special Branch and MI5, British police arrested seven men thought
to be linked to Osama bin Ladin's network. Among those arrested, according
to a Reuters report, are Khaled al Fawaz, the London representative of
the Saudi dissident “Advice and Reform Committee.” Al Fawaz has described
himself in recent interviews as an old friend of Osama Bin Ladin, whom
he called “a wise and a kind man.”

<P><B>The one that got away</B>
<BR>The FBI has offered a $2 million reward for information leading to
the arrest of Haroun Fazil, another top al-Qaida member accused of playing
a major role in the Nairobi bombing. Fazil, a native of the Comoros islands,
reportedly rented a villa where the bomb was assembled, and helped to plan
the attack. A week after the bombing he returned to his home in Moroni,
but managed to catch a flight to Dubai just before the FBI descended on
his residence. He is now thought to be in hiding in Afghanistan.

<P><B>Effects of the arrests unclear</B>
<BR>The arrests have revealed the extent of bin Ladin’s network of international
terrorism. According to the indictment against Whadi el-Hage, al-Qaida
has operatives in many western countries as well as in the Middle East
and Africa. Among the countries named in the indictment are: Sudan, Saudi
Arabia, Yemen, Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bosnia, Croatia,
Algeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, the Philippines, Tajikistan, Chechnya, Kashmir,
Azerbaijan, Kenya, and the United States.

<P>Although the recent arrests are undoubtedly an important achievement,
it is unclear what effect this will have on bin Ladin’s ability to carry
out future attacks. It may be that the main significance of the arrests
is symbolic--all this has shown what international cooperation against
terrorism can accomplish.
