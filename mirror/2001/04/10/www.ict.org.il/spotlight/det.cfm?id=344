<p><center><h2>Turkish Security Forces on Alert after Capture of Al-Qaidah
Militants</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Turkey's Counter-Terrorism units have been put on alert against possible
terrorist attacks, following the capture of Al-Qaidah militants. The militants were caught attempting to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran several weeks ago.<p><b>European countries alerted to possible terror attacks</b>
<br>According to <i>Al-Watan el-Arabi</i>, the interrogation of the Islamic
militants revealed that a "commando" unit affiliated with Osama bin Ladin
infiltrated into Turkey across the Iranian border. The results of the interrogations
prompted Turkish intelligence to inform their counterparts in Europe of
the possibility of action by bin Ladin's network in their countries.
<p>According to the Turkish report, the militants were financed by bin
Ladin and infiltrated into Turkey on his orders. Their purpose was to perpetrate
terrorist attacks during the upcoming summit conference on European Cooperation and Security, which will be attended by representatives
of 53 nations.
<p>The paper said that a wave of arrests is expected in several European
countries on the basis of the information provided by Turkey. Individuals
and cells affiliated with the Saudi militant are already under observation
by security forces, the paper said.
<p><b>The Iranian connection</b>
<br>What apparently caught the attention of the European authorities was
the implied connection between bin Ladin's network and the Iranian government.
<p>The Turkish intelligence brief called attention to the statement of
one of the captured militants to the effect that the unit was trained by an Iranian
official from the city of Tevriz. Most of the unit's members infiltrated
from Iran, while others entered Turkey by way of European countries, such
as Italy and Bosnia. The report said that two additional infiltrators were
still in Iran waiting to cross over into Turkey.
<p><b>Security beefed up around American and British diplomatic facilities</b>
<br>According to the Turkish Counter-Terrorist forces, bin Ladin's militants
also intended to target American and British diplomatic missions. Information
to this affect obtained from foreign intelligence sources has been disseminated
by the Turks to local security forces, who have been directed to beef up
security around American and British embassies.
<p>The Turkish authorities emphasized that six members of an eight
member team crossed into Turkey from Iran on 11 June, 1999 and are currently
at large somewhere in Turkey. The unit is said to include four Kurds and
two Algerians, all of whom are carrying forged passports.
<p>On 13 October an aide to Osama bin Ladin, Mahrez Hamduni was apprehended
at Istanbul's international airport during the course of a police action
in which Interpol was also involved. He was said to be carrying a Bosnian
passport.
