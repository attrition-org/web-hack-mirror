<p><center><h2>Ocalan Charged with Treason by Turkish Military
Court</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan was formally charged with
treason by a Turkish court today.
<p>Since his capture in Kenya last week, Ocalan has been held on the Imrali
prison island in the Sea of Marmara, where he is being questioned by a
team of three prosecutors from the Ankara State Security Court. In an unprecedented
move, Turkish authorities had evacuated all other convicts from the island
in order to "insure security." Talat Salk, one of the three prosecutors
in charge of Ocalan's questioning, told the Turkish press that the interrogation
was to have reached its final stages today.
<p><b>Proceedings likely to come under international scrutiny</b>
<br>Today's hearing was presided over by a security court judge and was
closed to the press and the public. According to the Turkish media, the
state is seeking the death penalty. The sentence, if carried out, will
mark the first time Turkey has executed a convict since 1984. No final
date has been set for the trial, which is expected to be take place at a quasi-military
court presided over by a panel of three judges. Due to the nature of the
charges, at least one of the judges is expected to be from the military
judiciary.
<p>Preparations for the Ocalan trial have come under scrutiny by Turkey's Western allies, who are concerned
about possible human rights violations.&nbsp; Human rights groups question
whether a state security court can judge the case fairly. There is also
concern that Ocalan was interrogated without a lawyer being present.
<p>A group of 15 lawyers, many of them human rights activists, has applied
to the State Security Court in Istanbul to be appointed as Ocalan's defense
lawyers. The group included Osman Baydemir, the deputy chairman of the
Human Rights Association and Eren Keskin, the director of the same association
in Istanbul. Baydemir was allowed to travel to Imrali today, though it
is unclear whether he was able to meet with Ocalan.
<p><b>"An affront to Turkish justice"</b>
<br>The European Union has called for international observers to be present at Ocalan's
trial, a call that Turkey has rejected out of hand. "The EU's idea of sending
observers to the trial means to approve and encourage interference in the
independent judiciary. This attitude which is against the principle of
a state of law is not acceptable," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told a press conference, "We expect the
politicians and governments of foreign countries, or the representatives
of any international body, to refrain from attempts to put pressure on
our courts. We would consider such attempts as an unacceptable affront
to Turkish justice."
<p><b>Greek-Turkish relations hit a new low</b>
<br>According to the Turkish press, Ocalan told his interrogators that
Greece had given extensive aid--including weapons and training--to the
PKK. Turkey has become increasingly vocal in denouncing Greek assistance
to Ocalan and hinted it might take military action against Greece if Athens
aids the Kurdish rebels in the future.
<p>"The political turmoil that has recently erupted in Greece has shown
that involvement with terrorism against Turkey is bound to have a boomerang
effect," Ecevit said, referring to the recent dismissal of several Greek
ministers over the affair. "I hope that Greek politicians will come to
realize that dialogue with Turkey would be a much safer way of addressing
common problems than supporting terrorism."
