<p><center><h2>U.S. Embassy Bombing Trial Opens</h2></center>
<p>
<p>After two years of legal work, intelligence gathering and preparations,
the trial of four men suspected of links to the 1998 bombing of the U.S.
embassies in East Africa has begun.
<p><b>Jury Selection begins</b>
<br>Jury selection began on Wednesday in the courtroom 318 of the Manhattan
Federal District Courthouse, with U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand presiding.
This was the same room where two previous high-profile terrorism cases,
were heard: that of the four men convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing, and that which convicted Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman and nine others
in a foiled plot to blow up New York City landmarks.
<p>Jury selection is expected to last up to one month, with lawyers for
both the defendants and the prosecution taking part in the selection process.&nbsp;
About 1,500 citizens were sent lengthy questionnaires in preparation for
jury selection. Judge Sand said that 16 potential jurors were interviewed
Wednesday. Six of those were excused and 10 made the first cut. Proceedings
resume Thursday morning.
<p><b>Trial is expected to last up to nine months</b>
<br>Twenty-two men have been charged in the bombings of the embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. Of these only four will be standing trial in the current
proceedings. Two other suspects are held in the U.S., one of whom will
be tried separately and one of whom has already pleaded guilty.
<p>Ali Mohamed, a former U.S. Army sergeant entered a guilty plea in October
to charges of conspiracy and murder and is expected to testify against
the others. It was Ali's testimony which provided the first direct link
between Osama bin Ladin and the embassy bombings.<font color="#990000"></font>
<p>Three additional suspects are jailed in Britain awaiting extradition
to the United States, and the rest, including bin Laden, remain at large.
The four men on trial in New York have pleaded innocent to murder charges
and two of them face the death penalty if convicted.
<ul>
<li>
Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, is the only defendant in custody charged with
a role in the bombing of the American embassy in Tanzania. He faces the
death penalty if convicted.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Mohamed Rashid Daoud al Owhali, 23, a Saudi, could also be executed for
throwing a grenade at embassy guards in the bombing of the US Embassy in
Nairobi. He has said that the attack was supposed to be a suicide mission,
and that he had not expected to survive the blast.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Wadih el Hage, 40, a Lebanon-born US citizen, admitted that he served in
the early 1990s as bin Ladin's personal secretary. He faces life in prison
if convicted.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, 35, a Jordanian national, is accused of planning and
executing the embassy attack in Nairobi. He faces life in prison if convicted.</li>
</ul>
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a Sudanese national, will be tried separately. He
faces additional charges of attacking a prison guard and attempting to
carry out an elaborate escape plan. Suspected of being one of bin Ladin's
top financial officers, Salim reportedly attempted to procure weapons of
mass destruction for bin Ladin. He was extradited to the United States
from Germany after his arrest near Munich in late 1998.
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>New evidence links al-Qaidah to Hizballah</b>
<br>NBC News quoted unidentified American officials as saying that the
trial would reveal connections between al-Qaidah and other Iran and Hizballah,
in addition to the known links to the Egyptian and Yemeni groups. According
to the officials, prosecutors are expected to detail meetings between bin
Ladin's representative and an official of the Iranian government. The goal
of the meetings was reportedly to establish an "anti-U.S. alliance."
<p>In addition, according to NBC, testimony will be brought forward concerning
a meeting between bin Ladin and Imad Mugniyeh, the operations director
of the Iranian-backed Hizballah organization. The bombings of the U.S.
embassies in East Africa bear an operational resemblance to Hizballah suicide
attacks against the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983.
<p>The bombing
succeeded in ousting the United States from Lebanon, a goal that bin Ladin
would like to see repeated in the case of American troops in Saudi Arabia
and the rest of the Muslim world.
