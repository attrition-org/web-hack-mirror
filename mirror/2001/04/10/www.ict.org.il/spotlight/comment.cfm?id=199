<P>This analysis is designed to convince Palestinian public opinion in
the Territories that the accord is worse than the Oslo Accord, and that
it weakens the Palestinian Authority even more than its predecessor does.
It also claims that in the case of this accord, unlike Oslo, there is a
large opposition in the Arab World and therefore it should be denied more
firmly. It should be pointed out that since the Sheikh Ahmad Yassin’s extensive
tour of the Arab countries earlier this year, both Hamas and its supporters
in the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood try hard to emphasize the importance
and vitality of the Arab world to the Palestinian issue. This is in some
respect a return to the traditional line of the Muslim Brotherhood, and
contrasts with the line they took during the uprising in favor of the independence
of Palestinian policy.

<P>The most important position in the analysis is the emphasis on the continuation
of the armed resistance. This is a signal that Hamas may agree with the
Palestinian Authority on a temporary interruption of the terrorist operations
inside Israel, but the resistance in the Territories against the army and
the Israeli settlers should go on. It is also a signal to the Palestinian
Authority that the accord is going to fail anyway because of the Israeli
conduct, and in this case the armed struggle may return to the Palestinian
arena. The point it makes is that in such a case Hamas will be a vital
resource, and therefore the Palestinian Authority would be shortsighted
in confiscating its arsenal of arms.
