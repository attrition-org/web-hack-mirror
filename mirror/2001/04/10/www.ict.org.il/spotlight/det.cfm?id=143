<p><center><h2>"Al-Shifa" Plant in Sudan Destroyed, Moderate Damage to Terrorist
Bases</h2></center>
<p>

<P>The U.S. made effective use of its technological advantage in Thursday's
strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan.&nbsp; Ironically, the heavy concentration
of U.S. naval power in the Persian Gulf and in the Mediterranean had its
origin in an entirely different conflict.&nbsp; Recent heightened tensions
between the U.S. and Iraq over weapons inspections resulted in the presence
of some very heavy guns in the region.&nbsp; Among the ships said to have
been already in the area are the missile-equipped USS Abraham Lincoln battle
group. In addition, the USS Essex Amphibious Readiness Group is stationed
in the Persian Gulf, about 700 miles from the Afghan target area. The USS
Dwight Eisenhower battle group was reportedly in the Mediterranean Sea,
not far from the Red Sea and Arabian Sea where the U.S. strikes are believed
to have originated.

<P><B>Tomahawk cruise missiles aided by satellites</B>
<BR>The strikes were carried out simultaneously, with between 75 and 80
long-range Tomahawk missiles used against the terrorist bases in Afghanistan
and the suspected chemical weapons factory in Khartoum. The targets reportedly
had been under surveillance by U.S. spy satellites, which can identify
and pinpoint targets with great accuracy, while global positioning satellites
were used to aim the guided missiles.

<P>The Tomahawk cruise missile, is particularly useful in the present situation,
due to its extreme range and accuracy. The Tomahawk's range is over 1,500
kilometers.&nbsp; But what especially commends cruise missile over aircraft
in the present situation is safety; the cruise missile does its job without
jeopardizing the safety of pilots or aircraft.&nbsp; An American air force
analyst was quoted by Israel radio as saying, "terrorist bases in the mountains
of Afghanistan are no place to risk getting shot down."

<P>National Security Director Sandy&nbsp; Berger was quoted by Reuters
as saying, "the primary motivator here was maintaining operational secrecy."
This is another advantage of using cruise missiles--they can be readied
for action without "giving the show away."

<P><B>Initial damage assessments</B>
<BR>Damage assessments of the strikes are beginning to filter out of Afghanistan.
The Taliban official radio reported 21 people killed and 30 wounded by
the U.S. strikes on the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base in the eastern area of
Khost. Pakistani reporters in Khost said that they had been told by witness
and security sources that at least 11 people had been killed and 53 wounded.

<P>The "al-Shifa" factory in Khartoum was said to be totally destroyed.&nbsp;
Sudanese television said there were dozens of casualties, with some people
still buried beneath the ruins. Hospital officials said they had the names
of 10 people injured in the missile attack, five of them seriously.&nbsp;
Sandy Berger said the factory, which was thought to manufacture one of
the ingredients for VX nerve gas, was "functionally destroyed."

<P>At a State Department briefing U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
acknowledged that hitting the terrorist targets could bring reprisals.
He pointed out that the goal of the attack was to curtail terrorist acts
in the making, however, he said, "In life, there is no perfect security."
He added, "There may be more such strikes. We will act unilaterally when
we must in order to protect our citizens, but we invite other nations of
the world to stand with us in this battle."
