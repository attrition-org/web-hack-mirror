<p><center><h2>Palestinian Authority Arrests PIJ Commander</h2></center>
<p>
<P>The Palestinian Authority has arrested the man suspected of planning
the November 6 suicide bombing in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market.&nbsp;
Iyad Hardan, who was arrested at the request of Israel is thought to be
the commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Jenin area. According
to Israeli security sources, he sent out two suicide bombers, Yusef Ali
Mohammed Zughayar and Suleiman Musa Dahayneh to execute the attack, which
resulted in 27 injured and the deaths of the bombers. Only a malfunction
in the explosives charge kept the attack from ending in more casualties.

<P>Hardan, is thought to have been hiding out in Jenin since the attack.
Since the Jenin area is under PA control, the Israeli General Security
Services passed on to the Palestinian police information that led to his
capture last week. He is currently being held in a PA prison.

<P>The Palestinian Islamic Jihad is less active than Hamas, but has a strong
presence in various parts of the territories. The group receives backing
and aid from Iran. According to Israeli security sources, the organization
does not have a sophisticated infrastructure in the territories, and both
the quantity and quality of its activists are inferior to those of Hamas.

<P>The Jenin PIJ cell, apparently led by Hardan, was responsible for two
other attacks in the past two years--the murder of an Israeli police officer
on the Trans-Samarian Highway, and a shooting attack in Baqa esh Sharqiyya
in which a Romanian worker was injured. Several members of the cell were
arrested, but Hardan managed to evade capture.

<P>Palestinian sources in the West Bank town of Bethlehem said they had
arrested four members of&nbsp; Hamas. One of them, Shahdi Subhi Abdel Rahman
Abu Khaja, appears on the list of activists submitted to the Palestinian
Authority by Israel. Abu Khaja took part in the attempted murder of Shimon
Dror on September 19, 1994. An accomplice, Majdi Khalifa, was caught by
Israel and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence. Under the terms
of the Wye agreement, the PA was to arrest and bring to trial thirty suspects
wanted for terrorist attacks in Israel.&nbsp; Twelve of the wanted activists
are currently serving in the Palestinian security forces.
