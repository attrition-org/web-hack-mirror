<p><center><h2>Ocalan Under Arrest in Turkey</h2></center>
<p><p>Abdullah Ocalan, leader to the Kurdish separatist movement has been
returned to Turkey, where he is wanted on charges of terrorism. The announcement
was made by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit at a news conference.
Ecevit declined to give details of the circumstances of Ocalan's apprehension,
saying only that it was part of a "clandestine operation."
<p>Ocalan was arrested in Italy in December on charges of entering
the country on a false passport. Turkey repeatedly requested his extradition,
but Italy refused on grounds that he would likely face the death penalty
there. Since leaving Italy on January 16, Ocalan has been turned away by
a number of European countries.
<p><b>Refuge in Kenya but no asylum</b>
<br>Last year Ocalan was forced out of his refuge in Syria when Turkey
threatened military action. Syria signed a <a href="../Articles/syria-turkey.htm">treaty</a>
with Turkey promising not to allow the PKK leader back into Syria. From
Damascus Ocalan made his way to Russia before moving on to Rome where he
still has an application for asylum pending. His presence in Italy caused
a serious diplomatic breach between Rome and Ankara. He left Italy, apparently
of his own will on January 16.
<p>Since then he has been on the run from one European capital to the next.
On the first of February he was refused entry into the Netherlands where he reportedly
wanted to take his peoples' case to the International Court of Arbitration.
After being shunted from one airport to another, he was finally granted
landing clearance at a Greek airport, apparently on the island of Corfu.
There his plane was refueled and he was sent on to Kenya.
<p>Greece is a traditional supporter of the Kurdish struggle for independence,
and has repeatedly been accused by Turkey of giving aid to the PKK. Athens
refused Ocalan's request for asylum, but offered him refuge in a Greek
diplomatic compound in Kenya. An official statement from the government
said, "The Greek government, in order to help seek and find a solution
to the problem of Abdullah Ocalan on a European level, granted him a place
to stay in Kenya."
<p><b>Ocalan was "tricked into handing himself over"</b>
<br>On Monday, Ocalan left the Greek compound. "Since that hour his whereabouts
have not been known," a Greek government spokesman said. Although details
are still sketchy, what is known is that Ocalan was turned over to the
Turkish authorities and is now back in Turkey, awaiting trial.
<p>Reports in the media claim Ocalan disappeared on his way to the airport,
where he hoped to fly to the Netherlands for another try at political asylum.
He was reportedly accompanied by Kenyan security personnel. Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said that, "He chose, despite our advice, to go
with the Kenyan authorities to the airport." He told reporters that
Greek diplomats had followed the Kenyan convoy but that Ocalan's
car had disappeared. The Kenyan government has officially denied any role in Ocalan's capture, and blamed the Greeks for dragging Kenya into the matter. The Greek ambassador to Kenya, George Costorlas was recalled.
<p>Ocalan's lawyer, Eberhard Schultz claimed that his client was tricked
into handing himself over to the Kenyan authorities. "According to my information,
my client was yesterday, based on a misrepresentation of the situation
by the Kenyan authorities, effectively dragged out of the Greek embassy,"
Schultz told German ARD television.
<p><b>Arrest sparks Kurdish protests all over Europe</b>
<br>Word of Ocalan's arrest set of a wave of Kurdish protests in Europe.
Demonstrators forced their way into the Greek embassy in London early Tuesday
and barricaded themselves inside. Within hours, similar protests broke
out around the Greek embassies and consulates in Bonn, The Hague, Moscow,
Brussels, Copenhagen and Vienna, consulates in Marseilles and Frankfurt
and the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva.
<p>In Vienna, the Greek ambassador and his wife were taken hostage. About
150 Kurds seized three hostages at the Greek Embassy at the Hague. Kurdish
protesters set fire to the Greek embassy in Kenya. Later, Yassar Kaya,
president of the exiled Kurdish parliament said that Ocalan's supporters
had been instructed to end their occupations of Greek embassies and missions
around Europe. "We have called on all our organizations to evacuate all
Greek embassies and consulates," he told a news conference in Athens. "The
PKK, Ocalan's party, will do the same shortly."
