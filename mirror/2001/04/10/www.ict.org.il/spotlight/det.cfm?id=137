<p><center><h2>Increasing Certainty that Suspect is Related to
Bombings</h2></center>
<p>

<P>American authorities are increasingly certain that the man detained
in Pakistan is indeed directly connected to the August 7th bombings of
the American embassies in East Africa.&nbsp; The suspect, identified as
Mohammad Sadik Odeh, was apprehended at Karachi international airport on
the same day as the bombings that killed 257 people in Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam.&nbsp; He was arrested for attempting to enter Pakistan on a
forged Yemeni passport, and for trying to bribe officials to release him.
The Pakistani's suspicions were further aroused by the fact that he had
arrived from Nairobi and was on his way to Afghanistan.

<P><B>A Link to bin Ladin?</B>
<BR>According to Pakistani sources, Odeh willingly gave a detailed account
of his role in the bombing in Nairobi, claiming that he had provided technical,
engineering and logistical support.&nbsp; He is reportedly a Palestinian
engineer, born in Jordan, whose marriage to a Kenyan woman and familiarity
with Nairobi, as well as his command of English qualified him for the mission.

<P>The <I>Washington Post </I>reported that sources at Pakistan's Military
Directorate of Intelligence, the Federal Investigative Agency, the Civilian
Intelligence Bureau and the Interservice Intelligence Agency said Odeh
claimed to have been one of seven operatives in Nairobi.&nbsp; They were
sent, he told interrogators, by Osama bin Ladin, the exiled Saudi financier
and&nbsp; sponsor of terrorism. Bin Ladin is currently "an honored guest"
of the Taliban in Afghanistan. He is implicated in a number of previous
terror attacks against Americans, such as the bombing of the Khobar Towers
in Saudi Arabia, which killed nineteen American servicemen and&nbsp; injured
some 500 people.

<P>Odeh reportedly told Pakistani interrogators that bin Ladin's operatives--including
Egyptians, Yemenis and Palestinians--had been planning the bombing for
several years. Apparently they had spent some time in Nairobi, collecting
information and constructing the bomb, before departing for Afghanistan
via Karachi using forged passports just prior to the bombing. According
to Odeh, the operatives had expected to be congratulated and thanked by
bin Ladin after returning to Afghanistan after the bombing. Odeh was quoted
by Pakistani news media as saying that he was proud of his role in the
bombing, and of having struck a blow for the Jihad against the United States.
According to two local papers, Odeh had expressed regret that 200 non-Americans
were also killed in the blasts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The <I>New York Times </I>reported that one or more other suspects
have been detained by Pakistani authorities, and are suspected of arranging
safe passage for Odeh and his colleagues through Pakistan to Afghanistan.
The paper also said that the American authorities suspect that if Odeh
did play a role in the bombing, it was probably an important one, due to
the fact that he remained in Kenya until the last minute.&nbsp; This could
mean that he had a direct role in either the construction of the bomb or
its transportation to the embassy.

<P><B>Pakistan - Between a Rock and a Hard Place</B>
<BR>On Sunday, Odeh was flown from Pakistan to Kenya, where American and
Kenyan authorities were waiting to question him.&nbsp; However, as of this
writing, he is not know to have confirmed his role in the bombings to the
American investigators. According to the Associated Press, a senior FBI
official said that Odeh had not admitted his involvement to U.S. interrogators
and that U.S. officials had not been able to confirm the details of the
Pakistani account.

<P>Reports of Odeh's extradition to Kenya were somewhat vague. Some sources
said that he was turned over to American&nbsp; agents who flew to Pakistan
to take custody of him.&nbsp; Others said that he was handed over to the
Kenyan authorities to face judgment.&nbsp; This later version is also that
of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, which issued a statement claiming that
"an Arab national by the name of Mohammed Sadik Odeh was interrogated by
our concerned agencies and on satisfaction about his involvement in these
terrorist acts, he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to Kenyan authorities
for appropriate action under their law."

<P>The source of this vagueness on the part of Pakistani authorities is
not difficult to understand.&nbsp; As a Muslim country, Pakistan is home
to people from all shades of the political and religious spectrum.&nbsp;
Pakistan's religious atmosphere is volatile at the best of times, with
sectarian violence a constant underlying threat ready to boil over at the
slightest provocation. In a country where Afghanistan's Taliban and its
adherents are regarded&nbsp; by some as Islamic heroes, the government
cannot afford to be seen as bowing to American pressure.

<P>Nevertheless, Pakistan has a long record of assisting the United States
to apprehend international terrorists. Pakistan was instrumental in the
arrest of Ramzi Yousef, who orchestrated the bombing of the World Trade
Center in 1995. More recently, in 1997,&nbsp; the Pakistani government
extradited Mir Amal Kansi, who was convicted of killing CIA employees outside
the agency's headquarters in 1993. The <I>Washington Post</I> reported
that Pakistani officials were very pleased with Odeh's capture and that
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif personally congratulated those involved. However
his congratulations had to be delivered in secret due to the extreme sensitivity
of the case.

<P>Another concern of the Pakistani government may be the consequences
if bin Ladin is incontrovertibly found to be behind the embassy bombings.&nbsp;
There is some popular support for bin Ladin within Pakistan, and this support
could erupt in anti-government violence should the government be seen to
side with the Americans against bin Ladin. The U.S. State Department, probably
thinking along the same lines, has ordered the departure of all non-essential
personnel from Pakistan and has warned visitors against traveling to the
country for fear they might be targeted by terrorists.

<P><B>What Now?</B>
<BR>An even more serious dilemma would&nbsp; face the Pakistani government
should the Americans request the use of Pakistani territory as a staging
ground for operations into Afghanistan.&nbsp; Bin Ladin is said to be holed
up in a heavily fortified underground hideout in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

<P>However, should he turn out to be the mastermind behind the attacks,
which seems more and more likely, the American government may be faced
with a dilemma of its own.

<P>Washington has reiterated time and time again that terrorists with American
blood on their hands will not escape justice.&nbsp; To a great extent this
has not been a hollow threat; the U.S. has an outstanding record for pursuing
suspected terrorists across continents, and over decades of searching.&nbsp;
However, there are also a large number of terror attacks on Americans that
have yet to be solved. Ironically the most prominent of these unsolved
cases, such as the Khobar Towers attack, also involve bin Ladin.

<P>Even without Odeh's testimony, the evidence against bin Ladin is slowly
accumulating. Vincent Cannistraro, former head of the CIA's counter-intelligence
unit, was quoted by the <I>Washington Post</I> as saying that he is aware
of intercepted electronic communications among bin Ladin's associates after
the embassy bombings in which they took credit for the attacks and exchanged
warm congratulations.

<P>However, if bin Ladin is finally implicated beyond reasonable doubt,
what can Washington do about it?&nbsp; Osama bin Ladin commands what amounts
to a small army of fanatically loyal volunteers.&nbsp; He is ensconced
in a veritable fortress in the mountains of Afghanistan, far beyond the
reach of the long arm of American justice.&nbsp; Some American officials
are worried about the influence on future would-be terrorists, if bin Ladin
should be convicted <I>inabsentia,</I> yet remain free.&nbsp; What of America's
lauded anti-terrorist stand then?

<P>If reports in the media are correct, American security forces have made
at least one attempt to apprehend Osama bin Ladin in the past, without
result. Nor is it likely that the Taliban would be willing to hand him
over to the U.S. According to the Taliban's official spokesman, "Osama
is a guest of the Islamic Emirate. We cannot extradite him to anybody."
With the "diplomatic" option thus neutralized, there would seem to remain
only the military option--not a promising alternative, given the circumstances.

<P>Obviously, the successful identification of the factors behind the bombings
will be only the first step in what promises to be an increasingly complicated
affair for the U.S., and indirectly for the rest of the western world.
