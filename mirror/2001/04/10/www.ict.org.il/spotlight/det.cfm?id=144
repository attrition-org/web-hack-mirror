<TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><B>Pakistan&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;<I>"The government of Pakistan expresses indignation at the U.S.
strikes at Afghanistan and Sudan."</I>&nbsp;
<BR><I>&nbsp;-- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz</I>&nbsp;

<P>The popular reaction to the American strikes was almost unanimous condemnation.
The leader of Pakistan's <I>Jamaat e-Islami</I>&nbsp;
religious party, Qazi Hussain declared that the U.S. had made
a mistake in attacking bin Ladin's bases. "It is a conspiracy against the
Muslim World," he said.&nbsp; Another religious leader, Qari Sher Mohammad
of the<I> Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam&nbsp;</I> party warned, "We will never forgive
America. It was a suicidal move from the U.S. We will definitely react."&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Young Pakistanis gathered on the streets in protests and declared,
"We will join the Jihad!"&nbsp; Popular anger was also turned against the
Pakistani government.&nbsp; Allegations were made that the government had
supported the American offensive by allowing the attacks to be launched
from Pakistani soil.&nbsp; The government was blamed for handing over Mohammed
Sadiq Odeh to the United States.&nbsp; There is a good deal of popular
support in Pakistan for the Taliban, and Osama bin Ladin is considered
an Islamic hero by some sections of the population.&nbsp;

<P>The U.S. Embassy and USIS buildings in Pakistan were deserted, there
staff having been evacuated on Wednesday.&nbsp; It almost seemed as if
most other western countries had pulled out as well. Very few foreigners
were in evidence the day after the American offensive.&nbsp; MSNBC News
reported that the diplomatic plates on a few of the U.S. embassy cars had
been replaced with less recognizable markings.</TD>

<TD><B>Afghanistan</B>&nbsp;

<br><I>"a gross violation of&nbsp; international law."</I>&nbsp;
<BR><I>-- the Taliban</I>&nbsp;

<P>The Islamic Taliban regime in Afghanistan denounced the U.S. raids as
"a gross violation of&nbsp; international law." The Taliban Foreign Ministry
in Kabul was quoted on state-run radio as saying that "U.S. missile strikes
on alleged terrorist camps won't intimidate us. We are a strong Muslim
country."&nbsp; Thousands of shouting protesters stoned the U.S. embassy--long-since
evacuated-- in Kabul. The Taliban said that Osama bin Ladin is safe and
well after the U.S. "aggression."&nbsp;

<P>In the Afghan capital Kabul shots were fired at a vehicle carrying
U.N. workers on Friday, wounding an Italian and a Frenchman. The charge
d'affaires of Italy's embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan said, "It is clear
that this was not an error but a reaction to yesterday's American attack."&nbsp;

<P>Bin Ladin himself announced that he was ready to continue the fight
"against the Crusaders and the Jews."&nbsp; His spokesman told the London-based
<I>al-Quds al-Arabi </I>paper, "The battle has not begun yet. The response
will be with action and not words." He&nbsp; vowed to carry out more attacks
on U.S. sites in retaliation for the missile strikes.</TD>

<TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><B>Sudan</B>&nbsp;

<br><I>"This is a terrorist action. This aggression targets Muslim and Arab
people. They have no right to strike Sudan without any vindication or evidence."</I>&nbsp;
<BR><I>&nbsp;-- President Omar el-Bashir</I>&nbsp;

<P>On local television the day after the U.S. missile strikes, Sudan's
President Omar el-Bashir declared, "Clinton and America will have to pay!"&nbsp;
El-Bashir said that Sudan could prove that the factory destroyed by U.S.
missiles "is specifically for pharmaceutical production."&nbsp; The Sudanese
government has declared the raid on the plant "a criminal act." Beshir
said Sudan will ask the United&nbsp; Nations to set up "a commission to
verify the nature of the activity of the plant." U.S. security sources
claim that the plant was a front for chemical weapons manufacture, and
that its product was a key component of VX nerve gas. Sudan has withdrawn
its diplomats from the United States.&nbsp;

<P>In Khartoum, angry Sudanese protesters stormed the empty U.S.&nbsp; Embassy
compound. State-run Sudan Television showed hundreds of people scaling
the fence around the building, and setting fire to the American flag within
the compound. Protesters shouted "Down, down USA", and "We are ready to
defend the faith!" The embassy was closed and evacuated after the August
7 of the U.S. embassies in east Africa. The majority of American diplomats
left Khartoum in 1996, when the State Department said it could no longer
guarantee their security.&nbsp;

<P>The Sudanese opposition sources in Cairo said that the factory targeted
by the U.S. air strikes was indeed a chemical weapons plant. The opposition
spokesman was quoted by Cairo news as saying, the al-Shifa factory "is
used for making chemical weapons with the help of foreign experts, notably
Iraqis."&nbsp;</TD>

<TD><B>Libya</B>&nbsp;

<br>Libyan state television reported that Muamar Gadhafi&nbsp; telephoned
Sudanese President el-Bashir to express Libya's support for the Sudanese
people "in the fight against this aggression." Gadhafi, on crutches after
a recent hip operation, was shown live on in the middle of a huge crowd
of demonstrators shouting anti-American slogans and burning a U.S. flag
at Tripoli's Martyrs Square.</TD>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><B>Egypt</B>&nbsp;
<BR>Sources in the Egyptian government were quoted in local papers as being
worried about the negative repercussions in the Arab world. But Egypt has
itself suffered severely from Islamic terrorism, totally the targeting
of tourists by the Armed Islamic Group.&nbsp; Though the Egyptian government
must be careful not to seem to support the American action, very little
real criticism has been voiced by official sources. Most were more worried
about the impact on the Arab world's perception of the American role in
the Middle East, fearing a further polarization of public opinion and repercussions
on the peace process.&nbsp;</TD>
