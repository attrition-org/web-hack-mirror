<p><center><h2>U.S. Embassies in East Africa Hit by Bomb Blasts</h2></center>
<p>
<P>Powerful explosions rocked the American embassies in the Kenyan and
Tanzanian capitals.&nbsp; Both blasts took place at about the same time--10:30
am local time.&nbsp; Embassy officials have confirmed that the explosions
were the result of bombs detonated near the embassies.&nbsp; It has now been established that both blasts were caused
by car bombs.

<P><B>Extensive damage to both embassies</B>
<BR>In the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the explosion toppled the nearby
Ufundi Cooperative building onto the embassy. According to the BBC, the
blast occurred shortly after U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell met with
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho at the nearby Cooperative Bank.&nbsp;
She was taken from the site on a stretcher, but was later reported to have
sustained only light wounds from flying debris. The Cooperative building,
located between the Trade Center and the embassy was completely leveled.&nbsp;
Security sources indicated that the bomb was placed there, rather than
at the embassy itself because of the embassy's bomb-proof construction.

<P>In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the explosion left a large crater outside
of the American embassy. An eyewitness at the scene said in an interview
with CNN that he thought the bomb had been placed near the southwest corner
of the building.&nbsp; "The people at the front of the building didn't
stand a chance," he said. The BBC reported that the blast occurred near
the spot where a petrol-tanker had been parked in the embassy parking lot.

<P>So far, the Red Cross has confirmed at least 60 dead in the explosions,
with another 500 wounded. It is expected that the toll of casualties will
rise as rescue efforts continue.&nbsp; A Red Cross worker in Dar es Salaam
said volunteers would be sifting through the rubble for many more hours
before the body count was completed.

<P><B>No group has claimed responsibility</B>
<BR>No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks.&nbsp; American
officials have stated that they feel certain that the blasts are unrelated
to U.S. relations with either of the counties in which the blasts occurred.&nbsp;
Constance Freeman, an expert on African Affairs, interviewed on the BBC,
said, "It is not clear what sort of local situation could have led to
[the attack]...The latest speculation leads to the fact that it has something
to do with Iraq, or some other Middle Eastern group."

<P>An unidentified source in Washington said that there was a good deal
of suspicion pointing to <A HREF="../articles/bin-ladin.htm">Osama bin-Ladin</A>.&nbsp;
The Saudi millionaire and terrorist financier has made repeated threats
to attack American targets (see <A HREF="../articles/bin-ladin2.htm">excerpts
from Interview with bin Ladin</A> and&nbsp; <A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/mideast_announce.html">U.S.
State Department Public Announcement</A>).&nbsp; There is no doubt that
his extensive terror network could have carried out the attack.

<P>Radio Monte Carlo mentioned that the "Islamic Jihad" had also threatened
to attack U.S. interests.&nbsp;Last week, the Arabic-language daily al-Hayat reported that the Egyptian &nbsp;<A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18">Jihad Group</a>, had vowed revenge on Americans,  because some of its members arrested in Albania had been extradited to Egypt, through American intervention. A number of security analysts in Israel
and abroad have pointed out the proximity of Kenya and Tanzania to Sudan,
a known supporter of various terrorist groups.&nbsp; Due to the relatively
low level of security at both embassies, as well as along the borders of
the East African countries, it would not have been difficult for a terrorist
group to slip across the borders with the necessary equipment to carry
out the attacks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Security has been tightened at other U.S. embassies, including that
in Kampala, Uganda. No advanced warning was received of the attacks, and
there was no specific intelligence that a terrorist attack was imminent
in either Kenya, or Tanzania.
