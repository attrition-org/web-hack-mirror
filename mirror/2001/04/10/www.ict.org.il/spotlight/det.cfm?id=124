<p><center><h2>Rescue Efforts Continue, Investigation Commences</h2></center>
<p>
<P>Rescue crews at the scene of the bomb blast in Nairobi have found only
a few survivors. The death toll in Friday's two terrorist bombings of U.S.
embassies has reached 153, with over 4,500 injured.&nbsp; The numbers are
expected to rise as the debris of what was once a five-story building is
cleared away.

<P><B>Sniffer dogs and high tech equipment</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/idf_dog.gif" HEIGHT=171 WIDTH=164 ALIGN=RIGHT>Israeli
rescue experts and search dogs began searching for survivors beneath the
rubble on Saturday night. The rescue unit, belonging to the IDF Home Front
Command, is equipped with equipment specially designed for extricating people
from collapsed buildings. Among the high-tech gadgets are heavy-duty balloons,
pneumatic jacks capable of lifting debris, and cutters that can slice through tons
of iron and cement. The team also brought along its trained sniffer
dogs, whose expertise proved invaluable during the gulf war and assorted
other man-made disasters.
<p>The Israeli team galvanized the rescue efforts, injecting a shot of morale into what was previously a slow and despondent operation.  Relations between the Kenyan volunteers and the American authorities had been deteriorating, due to the American insistence on closing the embassy area to rescuers.
<P>Six hours after the arrival of the 170-strong Israeli team team, they had found at least two
people alive in the wreckage, and managed to extricate one of them, a man who had
been trapped for more than 35 hours. The rescued man said that he had been
in contact with another survivor, a woman, still buried underneath the
debris. IDF officers said the rescue team had located several more survivors in the collapsed buildings and were able to communicate
with some of them. The rescuers pumped oxygen into the area where survivors were 
last heard.  A mother and child were rescued from an upper story of one of the nearby buildings; they had been afraid to descend the rubble-choked stairwell for fear of further collapse of the building. <P>The IDF Rescue Unit is trained to work around the clock in
the race against time to rescue survivors inside collapsed buildings. Unfortunately,
their efforts have mostly turned up corpses--as of this morning, 19 bodies,
including 9 Americans.

<P><B>Investigation gets underway</B>
<BR>An American team of 60 U.S. investigators is due to arrive in Nairobi
today.&nbsp; The FBI sent a separate team to the Tanzanian capital, Dar
es Salaam, which was hit by an almost simultaneous attack. Ha'aretz quoted
FBI spokesman, Frank Scafidi, as saying that the top priority is to determine
the kind of vehicle and the type of explosive device used in the attacks,
which would provide a kind of "fingerprint of who did it."

<P>Despite the claims of responsibility appearing in various papers, there
are as yet no solid leads to guide investigators in searching for the perpetrators.
The accounts of the explosion are conflicting. Many witnesses agreed that
they had heard a thud or small explosion before the main blast, perhaps
an exploding grenade. Others said they heard gunfire in the minutes before
the bombing.

<P>Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told a news conference that a
car bomb apparently went off in front of the entrance to the basement parking
lot of the American Embassy. "It is probable that in fact the person tried
to get in and could not get into the basement. Whether it was suicidal
and the person involved was in it or not, is difficult to say." Although
the parking lot behind the embassy, was monitored by closed circuit television
cameras it is unclear whether the cameras or film survived the blast.

<P>A leading Kenya newspaper, <I><A HREF="http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/Today/index.html" target="_new">The
Nation</A></I> reported a local man as saying that he witnessed several
men video-taping the embassy from all angles. When he pointed this out
to the Marine guards at the embassy he was told that there was no cause
to worry and that the cameramen were merely tourists. The witness said
that the cameramen seemed to be nervous and abrupt in their movements.

<P><B>Claims of responsibility</B>
<BR>There has been the usual flood of claims to responsibilty, such as
happens after most major terror attacks. A series of statements sent to
Qatar's al-Jazirah Satellite Channel claimed the Nairobi bombing was carried
out by two men from Mecca, while the attack in Dar es Salaam was carried
out by an Egyptian.

<P>One of the statements claimed that "The Islamic Army for the Liberation
of Holy Places announces responsibility for the Nairobi bombing under the
name operation Holy Kaaba." The attack in Dar es Salaam, said another statement
was codenamed "Operation Al-Aksa Mosque." The group behind the statements
identifyied itself as "Islamic holy warriors from all countries of the
world and who belong to all Moslem people." The attacks were carried out
because of what it called the occupation of Islamic holy sites in the Arabian
Peninsula by the US forces.

<P>Similar statements were sent to Radio France International and to the
London-based Arabic newspaper, al-Hayat. The messages called for the release
from prison of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, currently serving a life sentence
in the United States, and several others who appeared to be fundamentalist
clerics in Saudi Arabia. According to al-Hayyat, the group behind the claims
includes Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, Ayman Zawahri, leader of the
militant Egyptian Jihad organization, and several other terrorist and guerilla
groups. The authenticity of these claims is unclear.
