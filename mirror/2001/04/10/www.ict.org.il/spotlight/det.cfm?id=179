<p><center><h2>Turkish Hijacking ends with Death of Hijacker</h2></center>
<p><P>A Turkish airliner carrying 34 passengers and 6 crew members was hijacked
Thursday night.  The hijacking ended in Ankara early Friday morning
when an elite Turkish anti-terrorist team stormed the plane and killed
the hijacker.  None of the passengers were hurt.

<P>The Ankara-bound Turkish airlines Boeing 737 was hijacked after taking
off from Adana. The hijacker, apparently a sympathizer of the Kurdish Worker's
Party (PKK) demanded to be flown to Lausanne in Switzerland. Both the timing
of the hijacking and the choice of destination were symbolic;  seventy-five
years ago the Turkish republic came into being--and Kurdish hopes for an
independent homeland were dashed--with the signing of an international treaty
at Lausanne.

<P>The hijacker's demand, as read aloud by the pilot stated, "I request
that the plane be landed at Switzerland's Lausanne city, where the foundations
of a state were laid, to protest at the Turkish republic... Long Live Chairman
Apo." The reference was to Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the PKK, currently
believed to be in Russia. From passenger lists, Turkish authorities identified
the hijacker as a man who had previously been convicted for links with
the PKK.

<P>The crew managed to convince the hijacker that the plane did not have
enough fuel to reach Switzerland. After leading him to believe that they
were stopping in nearby Sofia, Bulgaria to refuel, they instead landed
the plane in Ankara.  During the next seven hours Turkish authorities
negotiated with the hijacker, while security and medical personnel took
up positions at the airport.

<P>In the early hours of the morning, a special police anti-terror team
stormed the plane as the crew diverted the hijacker's attention. 
The hijacker was killed without injury to the passengers or crew.

<P>This was the third hijacking in Turkey this year, and the only one in
which the hijacker was armed.  The previous incidents all ended without
anyone being injured.

<P>The PKK has suffered major setbacks in the past year, due to intensive
Turkish military operations against the organization's bases in northern
Iraq. Last month Turkey signed a treaty with Syria under which Syria
agreed to withdraw its support of the PKK and oust the group's fighters
from their basis in the Syrian-controlled Beka'a Valley in Lebanon. 
The PKK had often  launched raids into southeast Turkey from Syrian
territory. Under Turkish pressure, Syria also agreed to oust PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan from Damascus.
