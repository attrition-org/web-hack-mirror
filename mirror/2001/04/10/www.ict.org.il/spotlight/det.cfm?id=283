<p><center><h2>Kurdish Rebels Unleash Attacks in Turkey</h2></center>
<p><p>In the most serious attack since the sentencing of PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan, Kurdish Rebels opened fire with automatic weapons in a cafe in Elazig,
killing four people. The assailants--a man and
a woman--were killed in a shootout with Turkish police. Five people were
wounded in the attack, including a policeman, who is said to be in critical
condition.
<p><b>First attacks on civilians since Ocalan verdict</b>
<br>According to local reports the attack occurred at around 10:30 Thursday
night. It was the first attack on civilians since the verdict was handed
down in the Ocalan case, sentencing the Kurdish rebel leader to death for
treason.

<P>A few hours earlier, three people were lightly injured when a shrapnel 
bomb exploded in a coffee house in Istanbul's Gaziosmanpasha district.

<P>Later the same night, at around 11:15 p.m, a group of Kurdish rebels 
opened fire with automatic weapons on a police check-point near a brothel 
in the province of Van, killing one police officer and injuring a second.

<p>The PKK has threatened to take action to avenge the verdict against Ocalan,
but most of the recent fighting has targeted military personnel. So far
at least two dozen Kurdish rebels and four members of the Turkish security forces 
have been killed in clashes in Hakkari, Batman, Bingol and Sirnak provinces.
<p><b>Police on the alert in Turkey and European Capitals</b>
<br>Turkish security sources say that the PKK, which until recently targeted 
mostly smaller towns and villages, is beginning to focus more on the 
cities. Since the verdict against their leader, the PKK has urged its members 
abroad to maintain a low profile, in order not to damage the group's political 
stance in countries that might be instrumental in gaining legitimacy for the
Kurdish fight for autonomy.
At the same time, the Kurdish leaders have vowed to intensify the fight
against the Turkish government.
<p>Protests took place all over Europe in the wake of the Ocalan verdict.
Most of these ended peacefully. However, Turkish businesses in at least
nine cities in Germany have been firebombed since the verdict. Two people
were injured in the attacks, which targeted Turkish-owned restaurants, bars, 
and Turkish cultural centers.
<p>According to Ernst Uhrlau, security adviser to the German chancellor,
"The PKK is pursuing a dual-track strategy. On the one side a peaceful,
civil approach and on the other side violence against their enemies, the
Turks." Germany has the largest Turkish population in Europe. About a quarter
of the country's Turkish nationals are Kurds.
<p>According to the Turkey's Anatolian news agency, police in Istanbul arrested
10 people suspected of planning bomb attacks in a raid on suspected PKK
safehouses in Istanbul. Anti-terrorist police reportedly also discovered
explosives, which were to have been used in attacks in the city.
