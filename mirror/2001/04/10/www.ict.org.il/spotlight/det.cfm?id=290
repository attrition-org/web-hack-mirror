<p><center><h2>Albania Deports Three on Terrorism Charges</h2></center>
<p>
<p>Albanian authorities have deported three men suspected of planning a
terrorist action. The three--two Syrians and an Iraqi--were accused of
plotting an attack on the U.S. embassy in Tirana. They were reportedly
in Albania as overseers of an unnamed charity organization. On Friday they,
together with 16 of their family members, were deported to their respective
countries.
<p><b>Visit of U.S. Defense Secretary canceled</b>
<br>Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen canceled a stopover
in Albania due to a possible terrorist threat. According to ABC News, U.S.
officials determined that Osama bin Ladin's network was seeking to strike
at a "target of opportunity." Cohen was scheduled to spend five hours in
the Albanian capital to visit American troops stationed there and to meet
with local officials. The official reason given for the cancellation of
the visit was the small number of troop currently stationed there.
<p>However, the Secretary of Defense admitted that the terrorist threat
may have entered into it. Speaking to reporters, Cohen said, "We have been
following bin Ladin's activities and we have tried to anticipate wherever
he may move to conduct a terrorist operation against the United States
or our allies. Based on information that I have been following, he remains
dedicated to trying to conduct a terrorist operation."
<p><b>Communications intercepts point to bin Ladin activity in Albania</b>
<br>Although Cohen was not believed to be specifically targeted, it was
thought prudent to cancel the Albanian part of his trip. U.S intelligence
is said to have intercepted communications between bin Ladin's operatives
hinting that Albania might be used as a staging ground for terrorist attacks.
<p>Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also canceled
a visit to Albania following visit to Macedonia because of
security concerns. Evidence that bin Ladin's operatives were active there
was cited as one of the reasons for canceling the visit.
<p>Albania, a predominantly Muslim nation, was used as a transit point
for the influx of Islamic militants who came to fight for the liberation
of Kosovo. In addition, a number of Islamic charities in the region or
thought to be linked to bin Ladin and his network. Increasing lawless,
coupled with economic and political chaos make Albania a convenient base
of operations for would-be terrorists.
