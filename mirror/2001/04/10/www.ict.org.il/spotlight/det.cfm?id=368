<p><center><h2>U.S. Terror Suspect may have Links to bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<p>A 32 year-old Algerian man arrested while trying to smuggle explosive
into the U.S. may be linked to Osama bin Ladin, according to American officials.
On Friday, Ressam was charged with bringing the explosives into the United
States from Canada,&nbsp; having false identification and making false
statements to the U.S. Customs Service.
<p><b>Suspicious travel route alerted customs officers</b>
<br>Ahmed Ressam was detained last Tuesday at Port Angeles, Washington
about 60 miles northwest of Seattle. He was on his way to Seattle, Victoria,
British Columbia. He traveled first to Vancouver Island and from there
taking a ferry to Port Angeles, from which he was going on the Seattle.
<p>Customs officers at Port Angeles became suspicious at this round-about
route, and questioned Ressam about his plans. When they began searching
his car, Ressam fled on foot, and was caught some hours later several blocks
away.
<p>A search of the car Ressam was driving turned up 10 plastic bags containing
110 pounds of a white powder identified as urea, a legal substance used
to make explosives and fertilizers; two plastic bags containing about 14
pounds of sulfate, an absorption agent; and four small black boxes containing
homemade timers. Most of these materials were hidden in the spare tire
well. The materials were sufficient to manufacture one or more explosive
devises. 
<p><b>Suspect may have been a courier</b>
<br>Ressam had reservations in the name "Benni Antoine Norris" at a hotel
in downtown Seattle for Tuesday night. The hotel was only a few blocks
from the Space Needle and the Seattle Center, site of the city's huge millennial
New Year's Eve bash. On Wednesday Ressam was due to leave on an American
Airlines flight from Seattle to New York, with a stop in Chicago, and a
ticket for a connecting British Airways flight to London, according to
court papers.
<p>Security experts speculate that Ressam's role was to deliver the explosives
to Seattle, where others would assemble the explosive device(s). If true,
this would mean that Ressam's accomplices could be at large either in the
U.S. or Canada.
<p><b>Ressam familiar to Canadian Police</b>
<br>Andre Poirier, a spokesman for the Montreal Police Department was quoted
by CNN as saying that Ressam was familiar to the Canadian Police. His name
came up during the investigation when accused terrorist Karim Said Atmani
was extradited to France from Canada earlier this year. Ressam was arrested
in late 1998 in connection with the theft of laptops and cell phones from
cars and spent two weeks in jail. He was later linked to several burglaries.
<p>Atmani was accused of heading a crime ring which used burglaries to
finance terrorist activities. Investigators believe the money raised through
the thefts was quickly funneled out of Canada via a sophisticated network
passing through France, Belgium, Italy, Kosovo, Pakistan and finally, Algeria.
Last week, Canadian police arrested 11 alleged members of the ring, eight
of them Algerian nationals.
<p>Canadian authorities are currently investigating possible links between
Ressam and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA). Newsweek magazine, citing
unnamed Canadian police sources, reported that Ressam lived with Atmani
in Montreal for a time. Atmani was extradited from Canada to France in
connection with the 1995 Paris subway bombing that killed four people and
injured 86. The bombing was attributed to the Algerian radical Armed Islamic
Group.
<p><b>Operational methods could show link to bin Ladin</b>
<br>Ressam was carrying and tourist brochures for Washington, Oregon
and California, a Canadian passport and two Canadian driver's licenses, each in a different
name. The names were Benni Antoine Norris and
Mario Roig. By all accounts, a good deal of preparation went into Ressam's
cover. A native of Algeria, Ressam spoke French, and was thus a natural
for the part he was chosen to play.
<p>The make of the timerscarried by Ressam--each of which consisted of a circuit board with a Casio
watch and a 9-volt battery--was an echo of past terrorist
attacks. The use of the Casio watch was a trademark of the network affiliated
with Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted of the World Trade Center bombing
in 1993.
<p>The same type of timer has been linked to a number of other attacks,
almost all linked directly or indirectly to the network of Osama bin Ladin.
Security experts note that while terrorists organizations often do not
directly take responsibility for their attacks, they often use a "signature"
to identify an attack as their work. The distinctive timers may be just
such a signature for bin Ladin's operatives. Similar devices were used
in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, as well as in attacks in the Philippines,
an apartment bombing in Moscow earlier this year and the bombings of the US embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
