<p><center><h2>PKK Announces Ceasefire in Turkey</h2></center>
<p>

<P>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced a unilateral ceasefire
in its fight for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan
announced the ceasefire in a telephone interview on Kurdish MED-TV. He
said that the ceasefire was timed to correspond with the September 1st
World Peace Day. "Terror and violence are not the best ways in human relations.
For as long as we are not attacked by Turkish forces, we will not undertake
any armed action," he said, adding that the ceasefire would last until
April 1999.&nbsp; Kurdish sources said that although they would not initiate
attacks on Turkish forces, they reserved the right to fight in self-defense.&nbsp;
They also emphasized that the ceasefire did not apply to the PKK conflict
against the KDP forces in Southern (Iraqi) Kurdistan.

<P>Over the summer the PKK stepped up its attacks against Turkish security
forces in the southeast, and attempted to expand the fighting into other
areas of Turkey. However, the organization suffered major setbacks last
spring when Turkish forces attacked Kurdish bases in northern Iraq.

<P><B>PKK leaning toward a political solution</B>
<BR>The current ceasefire may be influenced in part by the PKK's military
losses.&nbsp; However there is speculation that the main stimulus for the
move comes from the diplomatic sphere.&nbsp; Ocalan is reported to have
met with European officials--namely from Germany and Sweden--in recent
months in an attempt to gain European acceptance for the group's cause.

<P>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was reported as saying, "We want
the Kurdish problem to be solved peacefully, however, the PKK should display
good intentions in that direction." The Kurdistan Observer reported that
the PKK has also had contacts with Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen.&nbsp;
The PKK reportedly obtained assurances that following the ceasefire announcement
Sweden and Germany would put pressure on Turkey to open negotiations with
the PKK on the question of Kurdish autonomy.

<P>The timing of the ceasefire announcement coincided with a changeover
in the military, as Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of general staff, hands
over command to General Huseyin Kivrikoglu.&nbsp; In addition, Turkey is
looking toward the general election next April.&nbsp; Some analysts see
the current ceasefire as an attempt by the PKK to renew its struggle in
the arena of national politics.

<P><B>Previous calls to end hostilities</B>
<BR>Ocalan has announced similar ceasefires on two occasions--in 1993 and
in 1995. In 1997, Abdullah Ocalan told Kurdish MED-TV that the PKK was
ready for a unilateral cease-fire and wanted to begin negotiations&nbsp;
with the Turkish government.&nbsp; Turkey has so far rejected all such
offers and refuses to negotiate with the group. Recently Ocalan claimed
that he no longer sought to separate the mainly Kurdish southeast from
Turkey, saying that, "Following a realistic policy of Kurdish independence
does not mean changing the borders."<B></B>

<P><B>Turkish government ignores ceasefire</B>
<BR>This time, too, the Turkish government said that it will not respond
to the ceasefire announcement. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said
Turkey would never agree to negotiate with the PKK and called on Ocalan
to surrender. Yilmaz added that the efforts of the PKK to create a political
platform in Europe would be in vain.

<P>Meanwhile, according to Reuters news agency, Turkish police detained
around 70 people in Diyarbakir, the capital of the mainly-Kurdish southeast
last Thursday, and prevented a protest calling for a negotiated settlement
to a conflict with Kurdish rebels. Witnesses said riot police using batons
dispersed up to a hundred demonstrators as they chanted peace slogans.
The city is the administrative center of emergency rule in force in the
southeast. Reuters reported that on Monday Turkish police detained over
120 people in Istanbul, including leading civil rights campaigners, as
they were departing for Diyarbakir to attend the rally.

<P>The 13 year-long conflict between Turkish security forces and the PKK
has cost the lives of more than 27,000 people on both sides. The PKK sees
itself as a national liberation movement, fighting for Kurdish sovereignty
in southeastern Turkey. Both Turkey and the United States consider the
PKK a terrorist organization, based on the fact that the group has employed
bombings and kidnappings in their struggle.
