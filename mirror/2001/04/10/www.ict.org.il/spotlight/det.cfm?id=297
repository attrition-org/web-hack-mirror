<p><center><h2>Taliban Denies Reports that bin
Ladin Leaving Afghanistan</h2></center>
<p><P>Reports in the Afghan press that Osama bin Ladin has decided to leave
Afghanistan have been denied by a Taliban spokesman. Maulwi Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil, senior spokesman for the militia, said that the reports were
"totally baseless," adding that bin Ladin "has been a guest of Afghan people
since the Afghan jihad against the Soviet forces and will remain so."

<P><B>Taliban gives conflicting signals</B>
<BR>The Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported earlier today that bin Ladin,
fearing an American attack, had decided to seek sanctuary in another Islamic
country. The AIP report, based on "sources close to bin Ladin," said that
"Osama has decided to leave Afghanistan because of fears of expected attacks
from the United States and also because of how much more Afghanistan can
suffer because of him." According to the AIP, the Taliban was in agreement
with bin Ladin's decision to leave, but had no intention of forcing him
to do so.

<P>The AIP news agency has been a channel for Taliban statements in the
past. This sparked speculation that the report might have been seeded by
the Islamic militia as an attempt to defuse mounting tension with the Americans
over the "Osama Affair." Several months ago the Taliban announced that
bin Ladin had "disappeared" from Afghanistan, only to admit later that
Osama was still in Afghanistan.

<P><B>Bin Ladin reportedly moving out of Jalalabad area</B>
<BR>As the anniversary of the August 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies draws
near, there have been persistent rumors in both Afghanistan and Pakistan
that the U.S. is poised to launch an attack on bin Ladin's hideout.

<P>According to a recent report in the London-based daily <i>Al-Hayyat</i>, bin Ladin
has abandoned his base near Jalalabad in fear of an "imminent" U.S. attack.
The paper said that Taliban officers supervised his move to a secret location
elsewhere in Afghanistan. The exiled Saudi militant was accompanied by
family members and more than 400 supporters. These reportedly included
his military chief Mohammed Atef, and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of
Egypt's outlawed al-Jihad group. Zawahiri was recently condemned to death<I>
in absentia</I> by an Egyptian court.

<P>The Taliban has denied that bin Ladin is involved in terrorism, and
say there is insufficient proof that he was behind the bombings of the
American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es-Salaam. According to Mutawakil,
bin Ladin is under heavy guard, and is not allowed to carry out political
activities or give interviews from Afghanistan. Nevertheless, bin Ladin's
recent interviews in the Arab press would seem to give the lie to the theory
that he is under house arrest.
