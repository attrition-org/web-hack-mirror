<p><center><h2>Three Killed in Car Bomb in Turkey</h2></center>
<p><p>A car bomb exploded in a central Turkish city of Cankiri, killing three
people and seriously wounding the regional governor. The bomb was planted
in a parked car along the route regularly taken by Governor Ayhan Cevik
on his way to work. Turkish authorities said that it was probably detonated
by remote control as the governor drove past. The governor's bodyguard
and two passersby--one of them a 14 year-old girl--were killed by the blast.
Nine other people, including the governor and his driver were injured.
Cevik underwent surgery to remove shrapnel from his head and upper body.
<p><b>Maoist guerilla group claims responsibility</b>
<br>It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack. Although suspicion
naturally fell on the PKK, whose supporters have carried out a number of
firebombings in the past few weeks, the city in not one in which the PKK
has been active in the past. In general the PKK has confined its activities
to southeastern parts of the country.
<p>The Turkish Anatolian news agency pointed out that the bomb almost certainly
was aimed at Governor Cevik. The governor has been the target of a number of
death threats from the Turkish Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army (TIKKO),
an ultra-leftist group espousing a Maoist ideology. Cevik's previous
posting was in the northern province of Tokat, an area where the TIKKO
is particularly active.  Last March Turkish security forces captured the leader of TIKKO,
and other key members of the organization.
<p>The Maoist group has since taken responsibility for the attack. 
The bombing was apparently motivated by revenge for Cevik's
part in the crackdown against TIKKO when he served as governor of Tokat. 
He reportedly escaped a similar bomb attack in 1997.
<p>TIKKO was founded in the 1970's, but its membership has steadily declined
in recent years. The organization operates predominantly in Turkey's Black
Sea and eastern regions. Among the group's past activities are bombings,
rocket attacks on security installations and kidnappings of government
officials.
<p>The PKK has been known to work in close cooperation with the Maoist
guerillas in the past few years. Turkish president Suleyman Demirel immediately condemned
the attack but stopped short of specifically blaming the PKK.
<p><b>PKK attacks on the rise</b>
<br>The PKK has threatened to escalate its attacks in response to the
arrest of its leader Abdullah Ocalan. The last few weeks have seen a number
of firebombings of businesses and coffee houses. On February 28, suspected
PKK supporters tossed a grenade into an Istanbul coffeehouse, injuring
17 people. a day earlier, another coffeehouse was attacked with two firebombs,
while two men fired into the building with automatic weapons before escaping
in a waiting car. Three people were injured in that attack.
<p>But the most serious attack occurred on Thursday in the southeastern
town of Batman. There a woman suicide bomber blew herself up near a police
station, injuring four other people. The attack was similar to others carried
out by the PKK in the past.
<p>Turkish security sources have beefed up security in major cities in
the wake of Ocalan's arrest, fearing that PKK supporters would begin broadening
the scope of attacks out of desperation. There are indications that splinter
groups may be forming in the PKK, according to the Anatolian news agency,
basing itself on security sources.
<p>On Thursday, Kurdish television announced that its recently-held congress
had re-elected Abdullah Ocalan as its leader, despite his arrest. In addition
the congress also established a presidential council to run the PKK in
Ocalan's absence.
