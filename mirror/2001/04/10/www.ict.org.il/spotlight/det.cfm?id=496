<p><center><h2>Syria and Turkey Sign Memorandum on Terrorism</h2></center>
<p>

<P>Syrian and Turkish officials have signed an agreement on cooperation
in the fight against terrorism, as well as organized crime and drug trafficking.

<P><B>Willingness to work against cross-border terrorism</B>
<BR>The Memorandum of Understanding was signed on Thursday, September 28th
during a three-day visit by Syrian officials in Turkey. The Syrian delegation
included Minister of Interior Affairs, Mohammad Harba, and Major General
Adnan Bader Hasan, Chief of the Political Security Organization, who in
the past was in charge of the diplomatic contacts with Turkey.

<P>The two met with Turkish president Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Interior Minister,
Sa'd Eddin Tantan and foreign ministry officials. Both sides declared a
willingness to cooperate and improve relations between the two countries.
Details of the memorandum have not yet been released.

<P>This agreement follows several others between the two countries, most
recently, the 1998 Adana agreement, intended to diminish the PKK's abilities
to operate from Syria and Lebanon. Syria has a record of violated territorial
obligations with Turkey, which has occasionally led to tension along the
800 km-long Turkish-Syrian border.

<P><B>Syria denies being a source of terrorism</B>
<BR>Syrian Interior Minister Harba emphasized during his visit that Syria
was a victim of terrorism rather than the source of it, while security
official Bader Hasan noted that no terrorist activity would be permitted
from Syria, should it endanger Turkey.

<P>Syria was previously a known supporter of anti-Turkish terrorist organizations,
among them the PKK, a Kurdish organization which aims to establish an independent
Kurdish state in the south of Turkey. In addition, Damascus has a policy
of turning a blind eye to the actions of the Lebanese Hizballah.

<P>Mending its relations with Turkey, combined with Hizballah's inactivity
over the last few months may help Syria's chances of being removed from
the U.S. State Department's list of countries supporting terrorism.

<P><B>Turkey turns to neighboring countries</B>
<BR>The agreement signed with Syria seems to be part of a larger effort
to create a cooperative environment between Turkey and its neighboring
countries. The efforts include
<UL>
<LI>
a protocol for cooperation with Georgia on September 22, dealing mainly
with crime prevention, but with provisions for coping with terrorism,</LI>

<LI>
cooperation with Uzbekistan, including joint training of anti terrorism
forces, exchange of information,</LI>

<LI>
urging Bulgaria to declare the&nbsp; PKK as a terrorist organization.</LI>
</UL>
The matter of counter-terrorism cooperation is now engaging the attention
of top Turkish officials. This seems to be a reflection of the understanding
that cooperation is a more efficient way of combating terrorism, especially
that operating across common borders. In addition, efforts are being made
to show Turkey as a calmer and safer place--a "European" country, rather
than a "Mediterranean" country.
