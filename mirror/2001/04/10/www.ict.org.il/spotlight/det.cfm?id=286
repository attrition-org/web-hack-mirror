<p><center><h2>The US Imposes Sanctions on Taliban over bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<p>US President Bill Clinton signed an executive order on Monday imposing
economic sanctions on the Afghan Taliban for its support of Osama bin Ladin.
<p><b>Taliban accused of providing "safe haven of operations" for bin Ladin</b>
<br>The <a href="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=26">executive order</a>
states that the sanctions are imposed due to "the actions and policies
of the Taliban in Afghanistan, in allowing territory under its control
in Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven and base of operations for Usama
bin Ladin and the Al-Qaida organization," which has "committed and threaten
to continue to commit acts of violence against the United States and its
nationals."
<p>The order prohibits trade or transactions with the Taliban or in territory
controlled by the Taliban, thus preventing any U.S. investment in Afghanistan.
It also freezes any Taliban-owned assets within U.S. jurisdiction. The
U.S. has tried repeatedly to persuade the Taliban to extradite bin Laden
to the United States, or to a third country to stand trial for his role
in the August 1998 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Taliban has refused.
<p>Bin Ladin now enjoys the dubious fame of appearing on the FBI's "Most
Wanted" list, with a $5 million price on his head. There are indications
that he may be in financial troubles, after his assets abroad were frozen
by the several western countries. It is unknown how much capital he has
tied up in anonymous accounts and "cover" companies.
<p><b>Taliban insists it has no knowledge of bin Ladin's whereabouts</b>
<br>Several months ago, a falling-out with his Taliban hosts caused bin
Ladin to shift his base, formerly near Kandahar, to another location. While
speculation was rife as to whether he had in fact left the country--as
the Taliban insisted he had--the United States remained convinced that
he was still in Afghanistan.
<p>This week the London <i>Observer</i> reported that bin Ladin moved two
months ago into an old collective farm in the village of Farmihadda, a
few miles south of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border.
A reported sighting of him in the area was confirmed by an Afghan military
commander and a Western intelligence source, according to the Observer.
Part of his military operations were reportedly moved into a nearby former
military base known as Tora Bora.
<p><b>A message to the Taliban</b>
<br>A presidential <a href="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=25">statement</a>
said, "to this day, bin Ladin and his network continue to plan new attacks
against Americans, without regard for the innocence of their intended victims
or for those non-Americans who might get in the way of his attack." The
executive order is meant to "deepen the international isolation of the
Taliban, limit its ability to support terrorist networks and demonstrate
the need to conform to the accepted norms of international behavior."
<p>However it's unclear what impact the sanctions will have. The number
of assets affected is not large, while trade between the U.S. and the Taliban
never reached the kind of proportions which would make the imposition of
sanctions economically meaningful. In 1998, according to the Associated
Press, U.S. trade with Afghanistan totaled $24 million. Currently nearly
half the world's population is under similar sanctions by the United States.
<p>The presidential statement pointed out that the order does not affect
humanitarian aid, food and medical supplies for civilian use, saying "it
is not aimed at the people of Afghanistan, but at the Taliban.&nbsp; Regardless
of the effectiveness of the measure, the message is clear--"those who nurture
terrorism must understand that we will not stand by while those whom they
protect target Americans."
