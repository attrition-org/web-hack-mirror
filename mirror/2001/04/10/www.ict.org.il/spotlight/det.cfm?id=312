<p><center><h2>PKK
Begins Withdrawal from Turkey</h2></center>
<p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) announced today that it has begun
pulling its forces out of Turkish territory a week ahead of the date decreed
by imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan.
<p><b>Withdrawal is in keeping with Ocalan's orders</b>
<br>In a statement published by the German-based Kurdish DEM news agency,
the Kurdish presidential council announced, "Our armed forces have started
their withdrawal from north Kurdistan [southeastern Turkey] even before
September First." Earlier this month Ocalan called on his organization
to end their armed rebellion against Turkey.
<p>The PKK promised a unilateral cease-fire and a withdrawal from Turkish
territory. According to the group's statement the withdrawal was moved
up as a gesture of sympathy in light of last week's devastating quake.
"To unilaterally stop the war at this time of heavy disaster is the greatest
support to the state and people of Turkey," the statement said. The PKK
claimed to have reduced its activities to the "lowest level possible,"
saying that any clashes that broke out were the responsibility of the Turkish
army.
<p><b>Less military activity, more political activity</b>
<br>PKK military forces will probably regroup in northern Iraq, where Iraqi
Kurds established a de facto autonomy after the 1991 Gulf War. The organization
has had often found itself in conflict with Kurds living in the region.
Recently however, the PKK announced a unilateral cease-fire in its with
the dominant Kurdish faction in the region.
<p>The planned withdrawal paves the way for a further demilitarization
and further politicization of the PKK. Some analysts say the PKK cease-fire
is merely making a virtue of necessity, as the organization has been militarily
weakened by successive Turkish army operations in southwestern Turkey and
northern Iraq. Politicization and demilitarization will help the PKK in
its attempt to win European support for its fight for a Kurdish homeland.
