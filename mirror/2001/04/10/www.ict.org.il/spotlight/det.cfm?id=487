<p><center><h2>Jordan Sentences Militants Linked to Bin Ladin</h2></center>
<p>
<p>A Jordanian military court sentenced six men to death for plotting to
attack tourist targets in the Kingdom during the Millennium celebrations.
The six, four of whom are at large, are among 28 militants indicted in
April of this year. Fifteen suspects, including 14 Jordanians of Palestinian
origin, an Iraqi and an Algerian were arrested in December 1999. Another suspect was arrested in May of this year in Amman.
<p><b>Climax of five-month trial</b>
<br>The trial of the militants is one of the most high profile trials ever
held in the Hashemite Kingdom and has been avidly followed by the foreign
press. At the time of the arrests, Jordanian Prosecutor General Lieutenant
General Mahmoud Obeidat said the cell was the most dangerous terrorist
group ever uncovered in Jordan.
<p>The group had reportedly planned attacks on Mount Nebo and a Christian
settlement along the Jordan River said to be the site where Jesus was baptized. The cell is linked to Osama bin Ladin's Al-Qaida organization, and reportedly
received extensive training in arms and explosive in camps belonging to
bin Ladin in Afghanistan. <P>General Obeidat said that instructions to the
cell were relayed by Zein Al Abiddeen Hassan, an Egyptian national currently
living in in Pakistan. "Zein Al Abiddeen Hassan is the representative of
Osama bin Ladin and one of the senior officials of al-Qaidah organization,"
 he said.<p><b>Half of the suspects tried <i>in absentia</i></b>
<br>The indictment against the defendants lists 12 charges, including membership
in an illegal group, plotting to carry out terrorist attacks on American
and tourist targets during Millennium celebrations and possession of weapons
and explosives.
<p>Twelve of the 28 suspects were tried <i>in absentia.</i>&nbsp; Six of
the defendants were acquitted on lack of evidence. The court commuted death sentences against two other militants to  life imprisonment, and handed down 15 year sentences to the rest. Some of these sentences were commuted to between seven-and-a-half years and 10 years.
<p>The sentences were read out at a court meeting attended by reporters.
Col. Tayel Raqad, the court's presiding judge, said that while little evidence
was found to implicate the six acquitted. "the court has no doubt that
those sentenced to death had a determined will to carry out terrorist attacks
against American and Jewish interests in Jordan."
<p><b>Terrorist "Encyclopedia" given to U.S. intelligence</b>
<br>The American newspaper <i>USA Today</i> reported on Monday that Jordanian
intelligence officials recently gave U.S. intelligence agencies electronic
copies of a six-volume "terrorism manual" found in the possession of one
of the suspects.
<p>The 1,000-page manual reportedly contains information on how to recruit
followers, conduct terrorist operations and assemble bombs similar to those
that destroyed U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998. According to the
report, U.S. officials had "positively confirmed" that the manual was distributed
by bin Ladin in his terrorist camps along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan.
