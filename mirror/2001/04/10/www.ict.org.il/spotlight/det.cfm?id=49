<p><center><h2>Turkish Troops Capture PKK Leader</h2></center>
<p><P>On April 14th Turkish Special Forces abducted a leader of the Kurdistan
Workers Party in a cross-border raid into Northern Iraq.&nbsp; It was one
of the most dramatic moves yet in the ongoing struggle against Kurdish
separatists.&nbsp; Semdin Sakik, a long-time strategist and field commander
of the PKK, was captured at a roadblock set up by Turkish troops disguised
as Kurdish guerillas.&nbsp; Working on intelligence that Sakik was due
in the area, the Turkish troops flew into the area - some 70 km from the
Iraqi border - by helicopter in the early hours of the morning.

<P>Sakik, nicknamed "Fingerless Zeki" after losing a thumb while firing
a rocket, split with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan last month in an internal
dispute.&nbsp; Ocalan had reportedly berated him for his lack of success
against Turkey's well-equipped military. Turkey blames Sakik for a number
of ruthless operations, including the 1993 killing of 33 unarmed soldiers
in eastern Turkey.&nbsp; That attack broke a cease-fire agreement.

<P><B>The Background of the Conflict</B>
<BR>The 13 year-long conflict between Turkish security forces and the PKK
has cost the lives of more than 27,000 people on both sides. The PKK sees
itself as a national liberation movement, fighting for Kurdish sovereignty
in southeastern Turkey. Both Turkey and the United States consider the
PKK a terrorist organization, based on the groups tactics.&nbsp; These
include bombings, kidnappings and indiscriminate killing of civilians.

<P>After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraqi Kurds established a de facto
state in northern Iraq , which allowed the Turkish Kurdish rebels to set
up bases there.

<P><B>Turkish Assault Takes its Toll</B>
<BR>The intensive Turkish military assault against the PKK has apparently
begun to take a toll on the organization.&nbsp; In Spring of last year,
Turkish troops launched the most ambitious offensive yet, crossing into
northern Iraq to set up semi-permanent bases and importing over 10,000
troops, backed by tanks, artillery and air power.&nbsp; That offensive
resulted in more than 1,300 PKK fighters dead with another 200 captured.
Turkish government sources claim a sharp increase in the Kurdish rebel
death toll in recent years and a decrease in PKK attacks.

<P>PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan told Kurdish MED-TV in 1997 that the PKK
was ready for a unilateral cease-fire and wanted to begin negotiations&nbsp;
with the Turkish government.&nbsp; Turkey has so far rejected all such
offers and refuses to negotiate with the group. Recently Ocalan claimed
that he no longer sought to separate the mainly Kurdish southeast from
Turkey, saying that, "Following a realistic policy of Kurdish independence
does not mean changing the borders".

<P>However, the rebel leader more recently told MED-TV that the PKK would
intensify the struggle if Turkey continued to refuse offers of a cease-fire
and negotiation.

<P>Ocalan reportedly lives in Damascus, though Syria denies Turkish charges
of sheltering him.&nbsp; Such charges have added to the souring of relations
between Turkey and the Arab world, already undermined by Turkey's growing
security ties to Israel, and repressive laws against Islamic religious
fundamentalism.&nbsp; Military action on Iraqi territory is not likely
to endear Turkey to its Arab neighbors.

<P><B>No End in Sight</B>
<BR>Even if turkey eventually removes the PKK as a military threat, the
ongoing situation in southeastern solution does not admit of simple solutions.
The region is home to millions of Kurds, who at present are denied the
chance to assert their own ethnic identity. This, and the poverty of the
region, means it is likely to remain a hotbed of trouble for turkey for generations,
if the situation remains as it is.
