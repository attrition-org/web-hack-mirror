   1            (Trial resumed)

   2            (Pages 1073-1074 filed under seal)

   3            (Recess)

   4            (In open court; jury not present)

   5            THE COURT:  I have reviewed the redactions in the

   6   3500 material for Agent Coleman and have found the redactions

   7   to be appropriate.  I had one or two questions which I have

   8   discussed with Mr. Karas and I am satisfied that the

   9   redactions are appropriate.

  10            Anything else before the jury is brought in?  Bring

  11   in the jury.

  12            This is the only case in the history of this

  13   courthouse that starts earlier than scheduled.  The next

  14   witness may take the stand.

  15            MR. KARAS:  Judge, first we are going to do CNN.

  16            THE COURT:  You don't need a witness for that?

  17            MR. KARAS:  No.

  18            MR. COHN:  Does your Honor know anything further

  19   about the juror's funeral plans?

  20            THE COURT:  No, he was going to let the marshal know,

  21   and I have been advised all sorts of things, but not of that.

  22            It gets shown on this?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  24            THE COURT:  Mr. Wilford, I was just wondering about

  25   Thursday a week, whether there is any possibility for it to be



                                                                1076



   1   scheduled so that someone else could be covering and the trial

   2   could go forward even in your absence.

   3            MR. WILFORD:  I think that would be possible -- yes.

   4            THE COURT:  There are so many reasons to adjourn.  I

   5   regret, for example, because Norman Ostrow was a friend and

   6   worked with me on the Committee on Jury Studies which I made

   7   reference to.  I really want to have a very restricted view on

   8   when we adjourn.  A juror is scheduling his mother's funeral

   9   so as not to interfere with the trial.

  10            (Jury present)

  11            THE COURT:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

  12            JURORS:  Good morning.

  13            THE COURT:  I have been presented with a stipulation.

  14   You recall a stipulation is an agreement among counsel, and

  15   the stipulation which is Government's Exhibit 33, reads:

  16            It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the

  17   United States of America and all counsel:

  18            1.  Government's Exhibit 80 is an authentic copy of a

  19   videotape of an interview conducted by representatives from

  20   CNN with Usama Bin Laden in Afghanistan on March 20, 1997.

  21   Portions of the interview aired on CNN on May 10, 1997 and a

  22   transcript of the entire interview later appeared on the CNN

  23   Web site.

  24            2.  Exhibit 80-T is a fair and accurate translation

  25   of the interview that is depicted on Government's Exhibit 80.



                                                                1077



   1            It is signed by all counsel in the case.

   2            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, at this time we would offer

   3   both the stipulation and Government's Exhibits 80 and 80-T,

   4   and propose that we play the video.

   5            THE COURT:  So Exhibit 33, the stipulation, and

   6   Exhibit 80 and 80T are received in evidence.

   7            (Government's Exhibits 33, 80 and 80T received in

   8   evidence)

   9            THE COURT:  You may play the tape.

  10            MR. KARAS:  Thank you, your Honor.

  11            (Videotape played)

  12            THE COURT:  All right, that concludes the playing of

  13   that exhibit.  The government may call its next witness.

  14            MR. KARAS:  Yes, Judge.  The government calls Special

  15   Agent Daniel Coleman.

   9            THE COURT:  Restate it.

  21   A   Yes, there were.

  22   Q   Can you describe the first room of the location at 1523

  23   Feda Estates?

  24   A   The main door to the house is located towards the center

  25   of the house on the porch.  As you walk into the house and you



                                                                1080



   1   enter a room that is apparently being used as an office.

   2   There is two desks within the room.  There is a desk directly

   3   beyond the door, which is facing sideways, facing out, and

   4   there is a desk to the back facing directly towards the door

   5   towards the back entrance.  The desk is located towards the

   6   back entrance of the room.

  15   manuals that go along with the computer, some address books,

  16   some notebooks, date planner --

  17            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, may I approach the witness?

  18            THE COURT:  Yes.

  19   Q   Agent Coleman, I placed before you what has been marked

  20   for identification as Government Exhibit 300 and ask you to

  21   take a look at that.

  22   A   Yes.

  23   Q   Can you tell us what that is?

  24   A   It's a McIntosh Power Book 140.

  25   Q   And is that the computer that was taken from that first



                                                                1081

  11            THE COURT:  Yes.

  12   Q   Agent Coleman, I placed before you what have been marked

  14   and 309.

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   Will you start with 304 and tell us what that is?

  17   A   It's a metal, it's called a phone index.  It pops up based

   1   what that is?

   2   A   This is a black planner diary, like a date planner.

   6   Q   Is it in substantially the same condition?

  15   Q   And 308?

  16   A   Again, it's a similar item but there one is tan in color

  17   green on the inside called a business card file and it

  19   Q   Do the two previous exhibits contain business cards as

  20   well?

  21   A   Yes, they do.

  22   Q   Finally, can you tell us what Government Exhibit 309 is?

  23   A   309 is a item called a Jambo Diary from 1997 and it's a

  25   Q   Were all of those items seized in that first room at Feda



                                                                1083

   7   304 through 309.

   8            THE COURT:  Yes, received.

   9            (Government's Exhibits 304 through 309 received in

  10   evidence)

  11   Q   Agent Coleman --

  12            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, 304 through 309, but there

  13   was no mention of 308.  308 is not admitted.

  14            MR. KARAS:  I apologize, that's correct.

  15            THE COURT:  So it's 304, 5, 6, 7 and 9 are received.

  16            MR. KARAS:  Yes.

  17   Q   Agent Coleman, was there any other computer equipment that

  18   was seized during this search?

  19   A   Yes, there was.

  20   Q   Can you tell us where that equipment was found?

  21   A   There is a bedroom in the house located directly adjacent

  22   to the front room.  The other items were located on the top

  23   shelf of a closet within the bedroom directly next to the door

  24   into the bedroom.

  25   Q   Will you tell us what these items were?



                                                                1084



   1   A   There was assorted equipment that goes along with a

   2   computer.  It includes power cords, two printers, assorted

   3   diskettes, the small size three and a half inch, and a mouse,

   4   a computer mouse.

   5            MR. KARAS:  May I approach the witness?

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.

   7   Q   Agent Coleman, I placed before you what have been marked

   8   for identification as Government Exhibits 301, 302, 303, and

   9   we'll start with those for a minute.  Can you tell us what 301

  10   is?

  11   A   301 is a power card for a McIntosh Power Book.

  12   Q   Can you tell us what 302 is?

  16   Q   And I've also placed before you in the Redwell what have

  17   been marked for identification as Government Exhibits 310-1

  18   through 310-67.

  19            THE COURT:  67?

  20            MR. KARAS:  310-1 through 310-67.  Can you tell us

  21   what those are?

  22   A   Yes, I can.  These are computer diskettes that were taken

  23   from the home in Nairobi.

  24   Q   And with respect to the exhibits you've just described,

  25   are they in substantially the same condition as when they were



                                                                1085



   1   first found?

   2   A   Yes, they are.

   3            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, at this time we would offer

   4   Government Exhibits 301, 302, 303, and 310-1 through 310-67.

   5            THE COURT:  Received.

   6            (Government's Exhibits 301, 302, 303, and 310-1

   7   through 310-67 received in evidence)

   8   Q   Now, Agent Coleman, were there any other objects seized

   9   during this search?

  10   A   Yes.  There were audio cassettes.

  11   Q   Where were those found?

  12   A   They're in a building directly behind the main building

  13   which contained a small apartment and a garage.  The cassettes

  14   were found in the apartment.

  15   Q   Can you tell us how long the search lasted?

  16   A   Approximately an hour.

  17   Q   And after the search was completed where did you and the

  18   Kenya officials go?

  19   A   We went to the police station at the Kenyata International

  20   Airport in Nairobi.

  21   Q   What did you do after you got to the Kenyata International

  22   Airport?

  23   A   I gave the computer to a computer technician for an

  24   examination and I began to make copies of the paper documents

  25   that I had obtained.



                                                                1086



   1   Q   What do you do with the disks?

   2   A   I also gave the disks to the computer technician.

   3            MR. KARAS:  May I approach the witness?

   4            THE COURT:  Yes.

   5   Q   Now, Agent Coleman, while you were photocopying the paper

   6   documents that were seized from Feda Estates, did anybody hand

   7   you any other documents to photocopy?

   8   A   Another agent gave me a stack of documents.

   9   Q   And did you make a photocopy of those documents?

  10   A   Yes, I did.

  11   Q   I placed before you what has been marked for

  12   identification as Government Exhibits 314 and ask you to take

  13   a look at that.

  14   A   Yes.

  15   Q   Can you tell us what that is?

  16   A   This is the passport, the American passport of Mr. El

  17   Hage.

  18   Q   Is it a photocopy of it?

  19   A   Yes, it is.

  20   Q   Did you make the photocopy of the photocopy of the

  21   passport?

  22   A   I made a copy of a copy.  I did not copy the original.

  23            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, at this time we offer

  24   Government Exhibit 314.

  25            THE COURT:  Received.



                                                                1087



   1            (Government's Exhibit 314 received in evidence)

   2   Q   Will you turn to Government Exhibit 315 and tell us what

   3   that is?

   4   A   It's a copy of a plane ticket for Mr. El Hage.

   5   Q   And 316?

   6   A   316 is a receipt from a hotel in Karachi, again for Mr. El

   7   Hage.

   8   Q   And 317?

   9   A   Is a copy of a small ring binder notebook.

  10   Q   Did you make all those copies?

  11   A   Again, I made copies of copies.  I did not copy the

  12   originals.

  13            MR. KARAS:  At this time, your Honor, we offer

  14   Government Exhibits 315, 316, and 317.

  15            THE COURT:  Received.

  16            (Government's Exhibits 315, 316 and 317 received in

  17   evidence)

  18   Q   With respect to the computer technician, did you see what

  19   he did with the laptop computer marked as 300?

  20   A   Yes, I did.

  21   Q   What did he do?

  22   A   He worked on it with his equipment, and produced a, what

  23   he called a mirror image of the computer for me.

  24   Q   And what, if anything, did you see him do with the disks?

  25   A   He copied several of the disks on to new diskettes and



                                                                1088



   1   gave me those copies.

   2   Q   Now, I placed before you what have been marked for

   3   identification as Government Exhibits 310-68 through 310-74.

   4   I ask you to take look at them.

   5   A   Yes.

   6   Q   What are they?

   7   A   These are the computer diskettes he gave me on that day.

   8   Q   Do your initials appear on them?

   9   A   Yes, they did.

  10   Q   Your Honor, at this time we offer Government Exhibits

  11   310-68 through 310-74.

  12            THE COURT:  Received.

  13            (Government's Exhibits 310-68 through 310-74 received

  14   in evidence)

  15            MR. KARAS:  No further questions.

  16            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, perhaps if we could have a

  17   break.

  18            THE COURT:  We'll take our mid-morning break.

                                                                1089



   1            (Jury not present)

   2            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, I would like to note the

   3   issue of the Kenyan warrant with this witness for the purpose

   4   of credibility and for the purpose of potential argument that

   5   we may make that we don't cross-examine the witness on

   6   something that we believe we should be permitted to cross him

   7   on, and it goes to as we argued yesterday.  It goes to

   8   credibility, because this witness saw the Kenyan warrant

   9   before the execution of the search, and it said for stolen

  10   property and we believe that there is no basis for that and

  11   this witness knew that, yet was content to let the Kenyan

  12   agents lie to the Kenyan court.  It has nothing to do with the

  13   legality of the search.  It goes to the credibility and

  14   disposition as to his willingness to let the Kenyan police lie

  15   to the Kenyan court.

  16            MR. KARAS:  Judge, there is no testimony, nor is

  17   there any reason to believe there will be testimony about what

  18   Agent Coleman could say the Kenyan officials told the Kenyan

  19   magistrate.  The fact that he was shown the warrant says

  20   nothing by itself as to what it was that was said to any

  21   Magistrate.

  22            In fact, the 3500 material that's presented, 3504-7

  23   at the second paragraph, Agent Coleman swore an affidavit that

  24   he believed then and he believes now that the Kenyan officials

  25   went to court in Kenyan and obtained the warrant from the



                                                                1090



   1   Kenyan judge.  That's all he says.  He doesn't say what they

   2   represented to the Judge, and he doesn't say that he has any

   3   reason to believe either that they misrepresented facts to the

   4   Kenyan judge or that the Kenyan warrant was invalid, not to

   5   mention the fact that the validity or the legality of the

   6   Kenyan presence at the search is irrelevant to the

   7   authentication of the exhibits that he just presented or his

   8   credibility in testifying that these exhibits are basically

   9   the ones that were seized that day in the house.

  10            MR. DRATEL:  Judge, I was shown a copy of the warrant

  11   which I assume that the Kenyan officials had obtained.  In

  12   addition, your Honor, what came out is that during the

  13   suppression motion was that in order to get the Kenyan

  14   officials to participate there had to be a Kenyan warrant.

  15            We believe that this agent knew of that in advance.

  16   If he didn't know in advance he just says no, but the point is

  17   did he know about it in advance, and we should be permitted to

  18   argue at the appropriate time that people who performed this

  19   investigation and conducted it were willing to lie to get

  20   evidence including --

  21            THE COURT:  The key phrase in what you've just said

  22   is, at the appropriate time, and the appropriate time would be

  23   some occasion when those issues would be relevant, the

  24   credibility of this witness might be relevant but all of this

  25   has nothing to do with the authentication of these documents.



                                                                1091



   1   If at some point you wish to call this witness as a defense

   2   witness, because you believe that the matters to which you

   3   referred to are relevant to some issue on the defense, I will

   4   entertain an application at that time, but as I stated

   5   yesterday, I don't see any nexus between the validity of the

   6   Kenyan warrant or the circumstances surrounding the obtaining

   7   of the Kenyan warrant and the testimony of this witness.

   8            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, he testified not only about

   9   the authentication.  He testified about the search, about the

  10   premise.  He also said the Kenyan officials were there.  The

  11   government should not be permitted to limit the scope just by

  12   not asking the question.  They put that in play by putting

  13   that on the record.  There is a distorted context not going to

  14   that.

  15            THE COURT:  As I said, you will have an opportunity

  16   at some appropriate time to recall this witness, and if any of

  17   these matters are relevant to the defendant's case I'll

  18   entertain them, but all that has happened is that this witness

  19   has authenticated these documents.

  20            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, if I might, then I would move

  21   to strike the answer and the question:  Who used that

  22   apartment?  Because that's not authentication.  And I was

  23   under the impression counsel was going to handle that on

  24   credibility issue in this conspiracy case.  That witness was

  25   asked who used that apartment, who he said Wadih El Hage among



                                                                1092



   1   others, and that is not authentication.  I move to strike that

   2   then based on the ruling here.

   3            MR. KARAS:  That's fine, Judge.

   4            THE COURT:  You have no objection to that?

   5            MR. KARAS:  I don't have a problem with that.

   6            THE COURT:  Granted without objection.  I'll so

   7   instruct the jury when they return.  We'll take a five-minute

   8   recess.

   9            (Recess)

  10            (In open court; jury not present)

  11            THE COURT:  All right.  When the jury returns I will

  12   instruct the jury that on motion by the defendants and with

  13   the consent of the government there is stricken from the

  14   testimony of the witness the question of whose premises did he

  15   understand were the subject of the search and his response, El

  16   Hage and others.

  17            Is that acceptable?  Mr. Dratel, you plan to

  18   cross-examine this witness?

  19            MR. DRATEL:  Yes.

  20            THE COURT:  May I inquire as to the scope of your

  21   cross-examination?

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, your Honor.  I intend to ask him

  23   about some of the factors respecting the execution of the

  24   warrant, who was there, who was giving direction to whom in

  25   terms of the --



                                                                1093



   1            THE COURT:  You know I have great difficulty with

   2   that.  The documents were offered in evidence.  There was no

   3   objection.  I paused, waited.  There was no objection.  They

   4   have been received.  Now you are going to cross-examine him as

   5   to what?

   6            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, he said certain people were

   7   there.  I would like to identify certain of those people who

   8   were there in the house.  That's number one.

   9            Number two is that also with respect to the passport

  10   issue, I think in terms of how that was received, and the

  11   context in which that was received I think is also something

  12   in terms of that they knew Mr. El Hage would not be there.

  13   They knew where he was and they went to meet him if the

  14   airport and while this agent did not specifically get the

  15   passport from Mr. El Hage, he knew exactly why the passport

  16   was taken from Mr. El Hage and where it went.

  17            THE COURT:  Is there an issue as to the authenticity

  18   of the documents?

  19            MR. DRATEL:  No, your Honor, but the point is, we

  20   would like the chain of custody in terms of how the document

  21   was obtained, is something that this witness testified to.

  22            THE COURT:  There is no question as to the

  23   authenticity but there is an issue as to the chain of custody?

  24            MR. DRATEL:  What I'm saying, your Honor, is we just

  25   want to establish how the passport was obtained.  We dispensed



                                                                1094



   1   with another witness in order to have this witness short cut

   2   this particular process.

   3            THE COURT:  Is that the case?

   4            MR. KARAS:  Judge, I think I can talk to Mr. Dratel.

   5   We may stipulate as to how the passport was obtained.

   6            THE COURT:  Why don't you attempt to do that.

   7            (Pause)

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, to save time there are some

   9   in limine matters regarding the next witness that do not need

  10   to be addressed.  I think we can start the witness and we can

  11   address the in limine matter at the next break so we don't

  12   delay the jury.

  13            (Pause)

  14            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, we have a stipulation with

  15   respect to some of the aspects.  Some of the other aspects

  16   which I spoke to Mr. Karas about the government will not

  17   object to.  There is one area that I would cross him on that

  18   the government does object to, so we might as well deal with

  19   that now.

  20            THE COURT:  What is that?

  21            MR. DRATEL:  With respect to Mr. El Hage was given a

  22   receipt by one of the Kenyan officers for the property.  Agent

  23   Coleman saw that occur.  He acknowledged that.  Following that

  24   Mr. El Hage contacted the government, US government to try to

  25   get those documents back because they were his address books



                                                                1095



   1   his business cards, everything he had, and he wanted to do

   2   that before leaving Kenya and returning to the United States.

   3            He was led to believe by the government that in fact

   4   the Kenyans perhaps had it, and the US was working with the

   5   Kenyans to tr to get that back to Mr. El Hage, and that during

   6   the period of time Mr. El Hage was in contact with the

   7   government giving them his travel plans which were accurate,

   8   and they met him at the airport in New York, and copied

   9   further documents and then returned them.

  10            THE COURT:  There is obviously a conflict between

  11   striking who occupied the premises and that line of

  12   cross-examination, assuming this witness is knowledgeable.

  13            MR. DRATEL:  If he doesn't know, he doesn't know,

  14   your Honor.

  15            THE COURT:  All right.

  16            MR. KARAS:  Judge, the only issue I have with

  17   Mr. Dratel is getting what happened at JFK Airport upon Mr. El

  18   Hage's arrival there.  I think that goes beyond the scope of

  19   what this witness testified to.

  20            THE COURT:  Bring in the jury and the witness.

                                                                1096



   1            (Jury present; witness resumed)

   2            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, from time to time I

   3   may order that a certain question or certain answer be

   4   stricken.  In that case you are to understand that to be

   5   disregarded as if the words were never spoken.

   6            On motion of the defendants and with the consent of

   7   the government there is stricken from evidence the question

   8   asked of this witness as to who he understood to be the

   9   occupant of the premises that were searched and the witness'

  10   response to that question.

  11            Cross-examination on behalf of defendant El Hage.

  12            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, one quick item.  We have an

  13   agreement by the parties that Government Exhibit 308 was

  14   mistakenly not included among the exhibits to be offered into

  15   evidence.  This was an exhibit Mr. Coleman testified about.

  16            THE COURT:  You are now offering it and it is

  17   stipulated it may be received.

  18            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, your Honor.

  19            THE COURT:  Very well, 308 received.

  20            (Government's Exhibit 308 received in evidence)

  21            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you cross.

  22   CROSS-EXAMINATION

  23   BY MR. DRATEL:

  24   Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Coleman.

  25   A   Good afternoon.



                                                                1097

  25            The search was at the behest of the United States



                                                                1098



   1   correct?

   2            MR. KARAS:  Objection.

   3            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   4   Q   You provided direction to the Kenyan agents during the

   5   search?

   6            MR. KARAS:  Objection.

   7            THE COURT:  No.  I'll allow that.

   8   A   Yes, I did.

  10   your own at the premises during the search, correct?

  11   A   Yes, I did.

  12   Q   Did you leave the notebook?

  13   A   Yes, I did.

  14   Q   And the following day you met with Mr. El Hage and he

  15   returned the notebook to you?

  16   A   Yes, he did.

  17   Q   And that meeting was at the Grand Regency Hotel in

  18   Nairobi?

  19   A   Yes, it was.

  20   Q   Now, with respect to the documents and the items that you

  21   seized that have been put in evidence during your direct

  22   testimony, you testified that the computer was in

  23   substantially the same condition as when you had seized it,

  24   correct?

  25   A   Yes.



                                                                1099



   1   Q   You mean externally, correct?

   2   A   I have no ability to judge its internal capacity.

   3   Q   So that would be you don't have anything whether it is

   4   substantially the same internally?

   5   A   I have no way to determine that.

   6   Q   With respect to the business cards, the business card book

  14   were still in Kenya when I left.

  15   Q   But they were sent to the United States?

  16   A   Yes, they were.

  17   Q   And you received, and you had access to them back in the

  18   United States when you returned?

  19   A   Yes, I did.

  20   Q   For purposes of your investigation?

  21   A   Yes.

  22   Q   That included the original computer itself, correct?

  23   A   Yes, it did.

  24   Q   All that the computer technician did was make a mirror of

  25   the hard drive, correct?



                                                                1100

   5   Q   During the search, at the conclusion of the search you

   6   witnessed one of the Kenyan officers providing Mr. El Hage's

   7   wife with an inventory of the documents of the items that were

   8   taken, correct?

   9   A   Yes.

  10   Q   And when you spoke to Mr. El Hage the next day he wanted

  11   those back, business cards, address books, things of that

  12   nature?

  13            MR. KARAS:  Objection.

  14            THE COURT:  I'll allow it.

  15   A   Yes, he did.

  16   Q   And he was told in fact that the US government was working

  22   government was working with the Kenyan police to try to get

  23   those items back to him as quickly as possible?

  24   A   I didn't tell him that.  One of my colleagues might have.

  25   Q   You don't know one way or the other?

   5            MR. KARAS:  Objection.

   6            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   7   Q   It's true, is it not, that the Kenyans never had

   8   possession of any of the items that were seized, that the

   9   United States, that is, you and your colleague had possession

  10   of the items you put in evidence that were seized at the

  11   residence?

  12   A   No.

  13            MR. KARAS:  Objection as to form, your Honor.

  14            THE COURT:  You may answer.

  15   A   No, that's not true.  The Kenyans did have possession.

  17   in the premises?

  18   A   Yes.

   5   A   I'm not sure.

   6   Q   With respect to --

   7            Yes, your Honor, if may have a moment?

   8            THE COURT:  Yes.

   9            (Pause)

  10   Q   So you don't know that any copies were made for the

  11   Kenyans?

  12   A   No, I don't.

  13            MR. DRATEL:  I have nothing further, your Honor.

  14            THE COURT:  Any further inquiry?

  15            MR. KARAS:  No, your Honor.

  16            THE COURT:  Thank you.  You may step down.

  13   Q   You have to keep your voice up a little bit louder, and it

  14   may help if you sit closer to the directional microphone,

  15   point it right at you, and if you see anyone in the courtroom

  17   to speak louder.

   1   Q   And for how long did you go to the catering school after

   2   high school?

   3   A   It was for three years.  In between in second year I went

  22   A   Yes, I learn English in high school.

  23   Q   And you could testify in English, but if you have a

  24   problem understanding what I say will you use the services of

  25   the interpreter?



                                                                1106

   2   Q   Seated to your right.  Did there come a time that you

   3   worked in France after you graduated from catering school?

   4   A   Yes, in 1989 I moved to France, I emigrate to France.

  11   Q   What do you mean when you say sneaking to Italy?

  12   A   It means I didn't had a visa to go to Italy.  That's why I

  16   A   Well, in Italy, at the beginning I visited main cities

   7   left Italy to Pakistan.

   8   Q   And can you tell the jury why it was you in January 1991

   9   that you went from Italy to Pakistan?

  10   A   Why the date or?

  11   Q   No, why did you do that?

  12   A   Well, I went normally to Afghanistan, but they said we

  13   have to go to Pakistan to go to Afghanistan.

  14   Q   Can you tell the jury why you wanted to go to Afghanistan?

  15   A   Well, at that time many people they were coming from all

  16   over the world towards Afghanistan to help Muslims there, and

  17   I was one of them.

  18   Q   When you went from Italy to Afghanistan did you travel

  19   alone or with others?

  20   A   No, I was with other four people.

  21   Q   And do you recall the names of any of the other four

  22   people that traveled with you?

  23   A   I remember a friend called Abu Ahmed el Masri.

  24   Q   So we're clear, do you know a person by the name of Abu

  25   Ubaidah al Banshiri?



                                                                1108



   1   A   Yes, I know.

   2   Q   The person you traveled with from Italy to Pakistan on a

   3   plane, Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri, is that the same person or a

   4   different person Abu Ubaidah al Rashidi?

   5   A   No, it's a different person.  That person was my age.

   6   He's younger than Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri.

   7   Q   Focus on el Masry who traveled with you, did he have an

   8   occupation?

   9   A   Yes, he was a veterainian or animal doctor.

  10            THE COURT:  What was he?

  11            THE WITNESS:  Veterainian.

  12            THE COURT:  Veterinarian.

  13            THE INTERPRETER:  Veterinarian.

  14   A   Veterinarian, sorry.

  15   Q   If I can ask that Government Exhibit 114 be displayed only

  16   to the witness and counsel.

  17            Do you recognize the person depicted in Government

  18   Exhibit 114 for identification?

  19   A   Yes, that's Abu Mohamed el Masry.

  20   Q   And is that a fair and accurate picture of the person you

  21   knew as Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri the, animal doctor?

  22   A   Yes.

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer Government

  24   Exhibit 114 at this time.

  25            THE COURT:  Received.



                                                                1109



   1            (Government's Exhibit 114 received in evidence.

   2   Q   Now, can you tell the jury how you got a visa to go to

   3   Pakistan when you were in Italy in 1991?

   4   A   Well, we got a visa from Rome, from the Pakistan embassy

   5   through Sheik Anwar Shaban.  He took our passport and he gave

   6   them to Abu Ubaidah, this guy, and he was the one who went to

   7   Rome and took a visa Tabliri people.

   8   Q   You mentioned T-A-B-L-I-R-I.  Can you explain to the

   9   people what Tabliri people are?

  10   A   Well, at that time those who went to Pakistan legally have

  11   to get this visa in order to go to Pakistan.  The easiest way

  12   is to apply for Tabliri.  Tabliri means some Muslims who are

  13   preaching Islam everywhere, and they have an annual meeting in

  14   Pakistan.  That's why when you ask for that visa they just

  15   give you the visa to go to Pakistan.

  16   Q   And was it your intention, did you intend actually to go

  17   there as a Tabliri or some different reason?

  18   A   No, it was thought to go to Afghanistan the reason.

  19   Q   Now, where in Pakistan did you go?

  20   A   Well, we reach Karachi, and we meet the plane going to

  21   Peshawar.  Then we took another plane to Islamabad, and from

  22   Islamabad we took another plane to Bait al Ansar, Peshawar.

  23   Q   And what happened when you arrived in Peshawar?

  24   A   Well, in Peshawar we met a guy called Abu from emirates,

  25   and he the guy who took us to --



                                                                1110



   1   Q   You said he was from emirates, are you referring to the

   2   United Arab Emirates?

   3   A   Yes.

   4   Q   You said you went to Bait al Ansar.  Can you tell the jury

   5   what happened when you arrived at Bait al Ansar in Peshawar?

   6   A   Well, Bait al Ansar was a guest house in which whenever

   7   you reach Peshawar the first day you have to go there because

   8   you find all the people there.  The first thing you do is you

   9   take all your valuable things like passports, money, whatever

  10   things you have.

  11            Then they give you, they put it in a safe place, they

  12   give you a number, and they let you know many things about

  13   Afghanistan, why you are here, how long you have your time for

  14   training, and which camp you are going to be trained in, and

  15   if you have clothes they let you know that you have to buy

  16   Afghan clothes in Afghanistan, and if you have money you can

  17   buy that in the store.  If you don't have money, they just

  18   provide you with clothes.

  19   Q   And what name did you go by when you were at Bait al Ansar

  20   in Peshawar?

  21   A   I was, I have a nickname Abu Zaid Maghrebi.

  22   Q   First, can you tell the jury what al Maghrebi means?

  23   A   It means the Morrocan, because you find Abu from another

  24   country so Abu Maghrebi.  That's why you have to specify your

  25   country.



                                                                1111



   1   Q   And you indicated that you were asked how long you

   2   intended to spend in Afghanistan.  What did you tell the

   3   people at Bait al Ansar as to how long you intended to stay in

   4   Afghanistan?

   5   A   My time was open.  That's what I told them I can stay

   6   whatever.

   7   Q   And what happened?  Did you stay in Bait al Ansar?

   8   A   I think we stayed two, three days, just for prepare

   9   ourselves and for other people to come in, and I don't

  10   remember who in Bait al Ansar provide us small van of 15

  11   people.  Then they gave us a date in the morning to go to

  12   another city in Pakistan called Miram Shah.

  13   Q   And how long roughly did it take to go from Peshawar

  14   Pakistan to Miram Shah, Pakistan?

  15   A   I don't remember exactly.  Probably five hours or six

  16   hours.

  17   Q   And what was the method of transportation?

  18   A   It's a minivan.

  19   Q   And what happened when you got to Miram Shah, Pakistan?

  20   A   When you got there is another guest house in Miram Shah,

  21   and we stayed there a few hours waiting for the car to come

  22   from the camp that we choose.

  23   Q   What was the name of the camp that you chose?

  24   A   I choose al Farouq camp.

  25   Q   Did you go to the Al Farouq camp?



                                                                1112



   1   A   Yes, I did.

   2   Q   And how long, how long a drive was this from the Miram

   3   Shah place to guest house to the Farouq camp?

   4   A   It wasn't that far, but because of the road wasn't good it

   5   took I think one hour or roughly one hour and one hour and a

   6   half.

   7   Q   And do you know the name of the biggest city that is near

   8   the Farouq camp in Afghanistan?

   9   A   The city Khost the big city.

  10   Q   And can you tell the jury what happened the first night

  11   you arrived in Farouq camp in Afghanistan?

  12   A   We arrived there around 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and

  13   normally they gave us a place where to stay, a tent or room or

  14   something, but I didn't find a place for me.

  15            Then they told me to spend the night in the mosque

  16   with other people, and during the night there was a shooting

  17   and big fire everywhere, and it was around 1 o'clock.  Then we

  18   came out from the mosque and all people were in the meeting

  19   there.  It's a matter of welcoming us to the camp.

  20   Q   The shooting was not an attack by other people.  That was

  21   a welcome to the camp?

  22   A   Yeah, it was a welcome to the camp.  Just they want us to

  23   know that the next life was so hard that's why you have to be

  24   prepared.  Don't think that you are coming to sleep in the

  25   camp.



                                                                1113



   1   Q   And how long did you spend at the Farouq camp?

   2   A   The normal time two months.

   3   Q   Can you tell us what you did during the two months at the

   4   Farouq camp?

   5   A   Well, we were trained for how to use the arms, and mines

   6   explosives and antiaircraft weapons.

   7   Q   Can you tell us what type of light weapons you were

   8   trained in?

   9   A   Well, in Farouq camp normally it's a camp divided in three

  10   parts.  The first part, the first part is about --

  11            MR. WILFORD:  I'm going to object to the witness

  12   saying "normally."  That's what he learned at that particular

  13   time.

  14            THE COURT:  All right.  Just answer the question.

  15   Q   Can you just tell us about the time that you went through

  16   as a person being trained in Farouq camp how it worked?

  17   A   Well, when I went there we spent in the first part almost

  18   a month and we trained in that first part we trained on the

  19   light weapons, like AK-47, M-16, BK, and some pistol and some

  20   other light weapons like Uzi and others.

  21   Q   Did there come a time when you used weapons other than the

  22   light weapons such as the rifle the Uzi you talked about?

   6   Q   And if I can show the witness Government Exhibit 110 for

   7   identification.  Do you recognize the person depicted in

   8   Government Exhibit 110?

   9   A   Yes, this is Haru al Qamar.

  10   Q   And is that a fair and accurate picture of the person you

  11   knew as Haru al Qamar?

  12   A   Yes.  Q AMA R.  Your Honor, I would offer Government

  13   Exhibit 110 in evidence.

  14            THE COURT:  Received.

   1   Q   You mentioned after you made bayat to al Qaeda in Mairam

   2   Shah guesthouse, that you had been on your way to the front.

   3   Did you actually go to the front?

   4   A   Yes, I went to the front, yes.

   5   Q   Where was the front?

   6   A   It was in a place called Badaloon.  It's near Khosh.

   7   Q   Did you fight on the front line or behind the front line?

   8   A   No, I was in the behind, because there are some other

   9   people who are there many days before me that have to go to

  10   the front.

  11   Q   How much time did you spend at the front?

  12   A   I don't remember exactly, probably two months.

  13   Q   Just so we are clear, who were you fighting at the time?

  14   A   Well, the communist government of Afghanistan at that

  15   time, and they were in Khost.

  16   Q   After your two months at the front, what did you do next?


  17   A   I went back to Peshawar.

  18   Q   Did you eventually return to the camps?

  19   A   Yes, I returned after -- I am not quite sure.  I went to

  20   another front in other city called Jalalabad.

  21   Q   Do you recall how long you spent at the front in

  22   Jalalabad?

  23   A   Probably 15 days.  I am not quite sure.

  24   Q   Did there come a time when you eventually returned to the

  25   training camps?



                                                                1130



   1   A   Yes.

   2   Q   Can you tell us approximately when that was?

   3            THE COURT:  What year are we talking about?

   4   A   Probably the end of '91, '92.

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  If I can display to the witness what

   6   has been marked Government's Exhibit for identification 250.

   7   I ask if you recognize what that is?

   8   A   This is a map of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

   9   Q   Does that appear to you from your experience of Pakistan

  10   and Afghanistan to be a fair and accurate map of that region?

  11   A   Yes.

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer

  13   Government's Exhibit 250 for identification into evidence.

  14            THE COURT:  Yes, received.

  15            (Government's Exhibit 250 received in evidence)

  16   Q   Do you see Peshawar in the map?

  17   A   Yes.

  18   Q   Is that in the grayish brownish area to the right?

  19   A   Excuse me.

  20   Q   Is it on the right side of the screen, the darkened area?

  21   A   Yes.

  22   Q   Does it have an airplane there signifying an airport?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   Can you tell us generally, even if not marked on the map,

  25   where the Miram Shah area of Pakistan is.



                                                                1131



   1   A   I don't see it here.

   2   Q   Can you find Khost?  Is Khost in Afghanistan or Pakistan?

   3   A   No, Khost is Afghanistan.

   4   Q   So that would be in the white area.

   5   A   I see Jalalabad here, but Khost --

   6   Q   Is Khost near the Afghani border?

   7   A   Yes, it is near the Pakistani border.

   8   Q   Do you know what state it is in?

   9   A   It's, I think -- no, I didn't see it.

  10   Q   Do you know the name of the state it is in, without

  11   looking?

  12   A   Excuse me.

  13   Q   Do you know the name of the Afghani state that Khost is

  14   in?

  15   A   No, I don't remember.

  16   Q   Why don't we come back to the map when we are a little

  17   better organized.

  18            Where were the Farouq camps?  How many camps were

  19   there in the Farouq area or Khost area?

  20   A   There were about three or four camps.

  21   Q   Do you recall the names of the three or four camps?

  22   A   There is a Farouq camp, and Abu Bakr Sadeek camp and Jihad

  23   War camp, and Khalid Ibn Walid.

  24   Q   Which camp did you go to after you finished at the front

  25   and Jalalabad?



                                                                1132



   1   A   They sent me to Abu Bakr Sadeek camp.

   2   Q   What did you do at the Abu Bakr Sadeek camp?

   3   A   I went there, supposed to be a trainer.

   4   Q   Did you actually serve as a trainer?

   5   A   Yes.

   6   Q   What did you train people in?

   7   A   I was training people for the same thing I learned in

   8   Farouq camp but it was different because the people coming to

   9   Sadeek camp don't have a lot of time to spend in Afghanistan.

  10   They have a week or two weeks or three weeks, they have a very

  11   short time.  That's why we teach them things very briefly,

  12   light weapons, explosives, some grenades, pistolettes.

  13   Q   Is a pistolette a small pistol?

  14   A   Yes, there are only two pistolettes there, Malakov and

  15   Valakov.

  16   Q   Was there an emir of the Abu Bakr Sadeek camp when you

  17   were training there?

  18   A   Yes, there was.

  19   Q   Who was the emir of the Abu Bakr Sadeek camp?

  20   A   Guy calls Abu Omar al Sebai.

  21   Q   Did you ever come to know Abu Omar al Sebai by another

  22   name?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   What was the other name or names that you knew him by?

  25   A   Hamad, or Khalid al Fawwaz.



                                                                1133



   1   Q   Do you know what his true legal name?

   2   A   Khalid Fawwaz was his true name.

   3   Q   Where did you know him by the name Hamad?

   4   A   That was in Kenya.

   5   Q   Let me show you what is premarked Government's Exhibit 109

   6   for identification, previously shown to counsel.  Do you

   7   recognize the person depicted in Government's Exhibit 109?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   Who is that?

  10   A   Khalid Fawwaz.

  11   Q   Is that a fair and accurate depiction of the person you

  12   knew as Khalid Fawwaz?

  13   A   Yes.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer

  15   Government's Exhibit 109.

  16            THE COURT:  Received.

  17            (Government's Exhibit 109 received in evidence)

  18   Q   Sir, how long did you spend serving as a trainer at the

  19   camp Abu Bakr al Sadeek?

  20   A   I don't remember, probably a year.

  21   Q   Did you train only at that camp or did you train at any of

  22   the neighboring camps at Khost?

  23   A   I was a trainer at Sadeek camp but sometimes we go to

  24   Jihad Wal camp for training.  I took explosive training in

  25   Jihad Wal camp.



                                                                1134



   1   Q   How long was the explosives training course you took at

   2   Jihad Wal camp?

   3   A   Fifteen days.

   4   Q   Do you recall who taught that class?

   5   A   We are many students, but the instructor was Muntasser al

   6   Jaziri.

   7   Q   Did you see any of the other people who were trainers at

   8   the Jihad Wal camp, or the managers?

   9   A   At that time Abu Islam el Masry, who was the emir of Jihad

  10   Wal.

  11   Q   You testified earlier there were two people in al Qaeda

  12   known as Abu Islam el Masry.  Which of the two was the emir of

  13   the Jihad Wal camp?

  14   A   Older one.

  15   Q   Do you recall any of the other people who were trainers,

  16   not students, at the Jihad Wal camp?

  17   A   Jihad Wal camp wasn't normally for training, it was like a

  18   headquarters of the other camps.  That's why you find people

  19   there, whether they are trainers or they are not on duty, like

  20   Saif al Ader was there.

  21   Q   During the time that you were a trainer at Abu Bakr Sadeek

  22   camp, do you know what the person Abu Ubaidah, the animal

  23   doctor, was doing?

  24   A   Yes.  We were assigned both of us as trainers, but he went

  25   to el Farouq camp and I went to el Sadeek camp.



                                                                1135



   1   Q   While you were teaching weapons in Sadeek camp, do you

   2   know what Abu Ubaidah the animal doctor was teaching at the

   3   Farouq camp?

   4   A   He was teaching explosives in the Farouq camp.

   5   Q   During the time that you were in the Abu Bakr Sadeek camp

   6   as a trainer, did you come to know a person by the name of

   7   Marwan?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   Was the person Marwan known by any other name?

  10   A   Yes, Abu Moath.

  11   Q   Marwan was also known as Abu Moath, correct?

  12   A   Yes.

  13   Q   And you were unsure whether it is al Philistini or Urdani,

  14   is that correct?

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   What does al Philistini mean?

  17   A   It means the Palestinian.

  18   Q   What does Urdani mean?

  19   A   Jordanian.

  20   Q   Do you know what the nationality of this person known as

  21   Abu Moath was?

  22   A   Either one of them, because I think 70 percent of

  23   Palestinians are living in Jordan.

  24   Q   Besides knowing Marwan from the camps in Abu Bakr Sadeek,

  25   did you see him in later years?



                                                                1136



   1   A   Yes, I saw him at Kenya.

   2   Q   I ask you to look around the courtroom today and ask you

   3   to tell us if you recognize the person known as Marwan or Abu

   4   Moath?

   5   A   Yes, I know.

   6   Q   Can you tell us where the person is seated?

   7   A   In front of.

   8   Q   If you describe where I am, where is he seated in relation

   9   to me?

  10   A   Number 4 on your right side.

  11   Q   Can you describe what he is wearing?

  12            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, we concede identification.

  13            THE COURT:  The identification of the defendant Odeh

  14   is conceded.

  15   Q   What did you understand that Marwan was doing in the camps

  16   while you were a trainer at Abu Bakr Sadeek?

  17   A   Marwan came at the end of, when I was in Sadeek camp, he

  18   came later on to Farouq camp as a trainer.

  19   Q   Do you know what Marwan was training people in?

  20   A   Well, I have never been there while he was training in el

  21   Farouq camp but from the brothers --

  22            MR. WILFORD:  Objection.

  23   Q   Answer this yes or no.  Did you ever discuss with Marwan

  24   or anyone in al Qaeda what Marwan was training people in?  Yes

  25   or no.



                                                                1137



   1            THE COURT:  Break it down.

   2   Q   Did you ever discuss with Marwan what it was that he was

   3   doing in the camps?  Yes or no.

   4   A   I discuss with other people.

   5   Q   And the other people you discussed it with, were they

   6   members of al Qaeda?  Yes or no.

   7   A   Yes.

   8   Q   Did they tell you what it was that Marwan was training

   9   people in?  Yes or no.

  10   A   Yes.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would now ask the

  12   question what did they tell you he was training for?

  13   A   As a maybe member of al Qaeda and the trainer in Abu Bakr

  14   Sadeek camp, when we meet each other, whether in el Farouq or

  15   Sadeek camp, the other trainers, we just say how is --

  16            MR. WILFORD:  Objection.

  17   Q   Don't tell us how you had the conversation, just tell us

  18   what you were told.

  19   A   He was a trainer in el Farouq camp.

  20   Q   Did they tell you what he trained people in, not the camp

  21   but what area of expertise?

  22   A   No.

  23   Q   At the time that you were in the camps for approximately

  24   one year, were you married?

  25   A   Yes, I was.



                                                                1138



   1   Q   Where did your wife live?

   2   A   She was living in Peshawar.

   3   Q   How often did you see your wife while you were at the camp

   4   in Afghanistan?

   5   A   It's a week in a month.  I mean, if I spend three weeks in

   6   the camp, the fourth week I go back to Peshawar.

   7   Q   Did there come a time when you left the area of the camps

   8   in Khost and moved somewhere else?

   9   A   Excuse me.

  10   Q   Did there come a time when you left your job as a trainer

  11   in the Abu Bakr Sadeek camp?

  12   A   Yes.

  13   Q   Where did you go?

  14   A   I went to Peshawar.

  15   Q   When you got to Peshawar, what did you do?

  16   A   I stayed there sometimes in Peshawar, then Abu Hafs el

  17   Masry called me with some other people for us to attend

  18   another training session.

  19   Q   When you said Abu Hafs called you, is that the same person

  20   Abu Hafs el Masry that you indicated was on the military

  21   committee?

  22   A   Yes.

  23   Q   When Abu Hafs told you to attend a training session, where

  24   did he tell you this?

  25   A   It was exactly in Usama Bin Laden's house in Hyatabad



                                                                1139



   1   Peshawar.

   2   Q   Is Hyatabad a neighborhood in Peshawar?

   3   A   It's in Peshawar, but I don't understand neighborhood

   4   exactly.  It's not far from Peshawar.  It's among Peshawar.

   5   It's one nice residential place of Peshawar.

   6   Q   Do you recall what year it was, and, if you recall,

   7   approximately what month that Abu Hafs told you and others to

   8   attend training during a meeting at Usama Bin Laden's house?

   9   A   It was approximately 1992.

  10   Q   Do you know if that was early or late 1992, if you recall?

  11   A   I am not quite sure.

  12   Q   Did he tell you then what type of training it would be?

  13   A   No.  Abu Hafs didn't tell us anything about the type of

  14   training but he told us that the trainer is a severe man, not

  15   very observant -- can I use the interpreter, please.

  16   (Interpreted) strict man.  He is very strict and very -- you

  17   have to just be patient with him.  He is very, very strict and

  18   not gentle.

  19   Q   And you mentioned that he wasn't observant.  Did Abu Hafs

  20   tell you in what manner this person was not observant?

  21   A   I mean he is not a good practitioner of Islam.  You can

  22   hear from him some bad words, which we weren't telling each

  23   other, from brothers.

  24   Q   Did Abu Hafs tell you whether or not this person who would

  25   be training you was a member of al Qaeda or not?



                                                                1140



   1   A   No, he didn't mention anything.

   2   Q   Did he tell you the name of the trainer?

   3   A   No, he didn't say anything.

   4   Q   Did you actually attend this training?

   5   A   Yes.

   6   Q   Can you tell the jury where the training took place and

   7   what kind of training it was?

   8   A   It was in the same place, in Hyatabad, the same area, but

   9   in another section of Hyatabad, a little bit big.  It was in,

  10   I think, phase two, something like that.  The trainer, the

  11   training was surveillance training.

  12   Q   Who was the trainer who taught you this surveillance

  13   training?

  14   A   It was Abu Mohamed al Amriki.

  15   Q   Can you tell the jury what al Amriki means.

  16   A   The American.

  17   Q   Can you tell us what other names you knew the person Abu

  18   Mohamed al Amriki by?

  19   A   I knew him by Bakhbola, by Bili Bili, by Haydara.

  20   Q   You mentioned Bakhbola.  We will come back to that in a

  21   moment.  You mentioned Bili Bili, and you mentioned Haydara.

  22   First starting with Bakhbola, do you know what that word means

  23   or what language that comes from?

  24   A   Well, this guy is a funny guy, and we had guy in the house

  25   we were training in, and that guy, he is Afghan and speaking



                                                                1141



   1   Afghani language.  I think he took it from the word Bakhbol.

   2   I don't understand that word, Afghan word.

   3   Q   So the word Bakhbol was an Afghan word, not Arabic word?

   4   A   Yes.

   5   Q   And you mentioned the name Bili Bili.  Does that name mean

   6   anything to you in Arabic or any other language you

   7   understand?

   8   A   No.

   9   Q   Did you get any indication of where he came up with that

  10   name?

  11   A   No, I said he is a funny guy all the time, bringing some

  12   new names.

  13   Q   And you mentioned Haydara.

  14   A   Yes.

  15   Q   Did he train alone or did he have assistance of someone

  16   else?

  17   A   No, there was another guy with him.

  18   Q   Do you recall who that person's name?

  19   A   Adnan.  He was Egyptian.

  20   Q   The person that you knew as Abu Mohamed, the American,

  21   what nationality did he appear to be?

  22   A   What is his nationality?

  23   Q   Yes.

  24   A   He is Egyptian.

  25   Q   What languages did he speak?



                                                                1142



   1   A   Arabic.

   2   Q   Did you ever speak English with him?  Did you know English

   3   at the time?

   4   A   I was speaking English, but no, he doesn't speak English

   5   with me.  He was speaking only Arabic.

   6   Q   Can you tell us who the students were in the class taught

   7   by this Abu Mohamed al Amriki.

   8   A   We are two groups normally, each group of four people.

   9   The first group was me and Anas al Liby and Saif al Liby.

  10   Q   Anyone else you recall in the first group besides

  11   yourself, Anas al Liby and Saif al Liby?

  12   A   I think Abu Madyan el Masry.  In the other group there was

  13   Abu Ahmed el Masry and another guy, a Jordanian guy, and

  14   another Saudi guy.  And Abu Rifa al Liby.

  15   Q   Can you tell the jury what it was you were trained in by

  16   the person Abu Mohamed the American?

  17   A   At the beginning he started checking our intelligence and

  18   some exercise.  After that, he explained about the trainer.

  19   It's surveillance, how to make surveillance of targets and how

  20   to collect information about these targets.

  21   Q   Can you describe what it was you were told to do when you

  22   collected information and did surveillance of targets.  What

  23   were the details of what you were instructed to do?

  24   A   So as to collect information about the target we use

  25   different techniques, like, for example, using, whether to go



                                                                1143



   1   to see the target, then you take pictures of that target, then

   2   locate the target in a map, then if you can go in the target

   3   so as to see how many people are working there, if there are

   4   some people there or not.  And all kind of information that

   5   can help in your report.

   6   Q   Before we get to the report, were you trained in any

   7   particular equipment to use during surveillance?

   8   A   Yes.  We trained how to use different cameras, especially

   9   small cameras, and how to take pictures in the guesthouse in

  10   which we were living.  You take your camera without using the

  11   camera straight in your eyes.  You just take it like this.

  12   And another guy came behind us to see if you are taking the

  13   target very well or not.  Then he will say go down or up,

  14   until you used to take the picture very well without using

  15   your eyes.

  16   Q   Do you recall what type of cameras were you were trained

  17   to use?

  18   A   There was Olympus and Canon.  I don't remember the others.

  19   Q   What were you supposed to do with the film once you took

  20   the pictures?

  21   A   After taking, normally after taking pictures we go back to

  22   our place and we develop them, that picture, that film, using

  23   a machine, and product, fixer and developer and water.

  24   Normally you take a place in that room, we close all the

  25   places and we use only the red lights and we use some bowls in



                                                                1144



   1   which there is some fixers and developer and we wash that

   2   films, and put them up to dry, and after that we use the

   3   machine so as to get the pictures.

   4   Q   Were you trained during this time in how to develop

   5   pictures with the negatives and using developing fluid?

   6   A   Yes.

   7   Q   Tell us about what you were instructed to write in the

   8   reports when you did a surveillance.

   9   A   Writing the report normally, in the front paper you say

  10   how secret it is in the top, the target you are using, and the

  11   daytime date, the date, and even the time you started your

  12   work, and the name of the target, and you start describing the

  13   target and putting all the information of the target.  You

  14   draw the pictures, if there is a map, and some addresses.

  15   Q   How would you describe the target in the reports that you

  16   were trained to write?

  17   A   For example, if it's a room like this one, if you can get

  18   in that room, you just go in and you look at how it is from

  19   inside, how it is from outside, the walls, the colors, how big

  20   are the walls and which color are they and how high they are,

  21   the lights, the doors, the floor, everything that you can see,

  22   all information about that room.

  23   Q   In the beginning you said you described what the target

  24   was.  If you were looking at a post office, what would you

  25   write in the report?



                                                                1145



   1   A   You write the post office there.

   2   Q   Did you ever use numbers in the reports?

   3   A   Sometimes you use the number, other code.

   4   Q   During this time did any of the people in the class have

   5   any equipment besides camera equipment and equipment to

   6   develop pictures?

   7   A   At the end, Abu Anas al Liby brought two computers so as

   8   to teach us how to put all this information we collected.

   9   Instead of reporting you put them in the computer and just put

  10   them in a disk so as to be easy to carry.

  11   Q   How long did this training last?

  12   A   It was almost two weeks.

  13   Q   During that time, did your group or the other group do any

  14   practical exercises, where you would go out and do actual

  15   surveillances of places other than the building where you were

  16   working?

  17   A   Yes.  We started with small things, like bridge, like

  18   stadium, like normal places in which nobody is, and then in

  19   the second stage we went to police stations, for example, and

  20   in my group we were trained to go to Iranian consulate and

  21   Iranian cultural center.

  22   Q   Where were the Iranian consulate and Iranian cultural

  23   center?  In what city?

  24   A   Everything was in Peshawar.  We were only in Peshawar.

  25   Q   During your training, were you instructed as to what would



                                                                1146



   1   happen to the reports once they were written?

   2   A   Normally if you write a report, you take it to a safe

   3   place where you can drop it, and somebody else will come and

   4   take it to your boss.

   5   Q   Were you told what the roles would be in terms of who

   6   would do what with the report?

   7   A   I didn't ask that.

   8   Q   If your understanding was if you were trained in

   9   surveillance you wrote the report, what role would the person

  10   who wrote the report perform afterward?

  11            MR. WILFORD:  Objection.

  12            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  13   A   I didn't understand that.  (Interpreted)

  14            That was the end of his role.

  15   Q   Did you know what happened to the report, who it would go

  16   to, whether there was any other group involved?

  17   A   During the training, Mohammed explained us that this job

  18   is the first part of military part.  I mean, you collect the

  19   information about this certain targets, and whenever you

  20   finish your work, our group, we just leave, we send our

  21   reports to our bosses and we leave.  So this number two -- our

  22   bosses are number two.  Those people, they go through this

  23   report and they read all the information, and everything.

  24   Then they decide, they make some decisions how to attack that

  25   target, and the first -- then they send another group who



                                                                1147



   1   supply everything so as to attack that target.  Whenever that

   2   group, third group finish his job, he has to leave.  No one at

   3   the end the fourth group who can do the job come so as to do

   4   the final job.

   5   Q   So there are four groups.

   6   A   Yes, four groups.

   7   Q   Let me show you a picture that has been marked for

   8   identification as Government's Exhibit 112 and ask you to look

   9   at Government's Exhibit 112 for identification and tell us if

  10   you recognize the person in that photograph.

  11   A   Yes, I do.

  12   Q   Who is that?

  13   A   Anas al Liby.

  14   Q   Is that a fair and accurate depiction of the person you

  15   knew as Anas al Liby?

  16   A   Yes.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer Exhibit

  18   112 in evidence.

  19            THE COURT:  Yes, received.

  20            (Government's Exhibit 112 received in evidence)

  21   Q   Is that the Anas al Liby who was also attending this class

  22   and who had the two computers?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   During the time that you and your group participated in

  25   the exercises to do the surveillances of the Iranian consulate



                                                                1148



   1   and the Iranian cultural center, did you have an understanding

   2   whether or not those surveillances were for a real operation

   3   or for practice, or were you not sure?

   4   A   No, we weren't sure.

   5   Q   During this time did you surveil any people in addition to

   6   surveilling buildings?

   7   A   Yes.  We were trained so as to make -- I will use the

   8   interpreter.

   9            (Through interpreter) It means we would be in

  10   surveillance of somebody following him on foot, or if it's

  11   going to be by car, following him by car.

  12   Q   During this time, during that two-week period did you

  13   actually do a surveillance of a real person?

  14   A   Yes, we were trained to do that between us, but after that

  15   we done the surveillance for a guy coming from Islamabad.  He

  16   was Egyptian and he was working in the Egyptian embassy, and

  17   he was coming to Peshawar so as to contact a guy there in

  18   Peshawar.  So we were following him.

  19   Q   Who was in the group that followed him?

  20   A   I think all members of the both groups, we were all of us

  21   working on that.

  22   Q   During the time of this two weeks training, when you were

  23   trained by Abu Mohamed, the American, and Adnan, did you ever

  24   learn whether or not they were members of al Qaeda?

  25   A   No, I don't think -- no, they were not from al Qaeda.



                                                                1149



   1   Q   Did you ever learn what group they were from?

   2   A   We have been told that they were from Al Jihad group.

   3   Q   The Al Jihad group from which country?

   4   A   The Egyptian Al Jihad group.

   5   Q   After the training was over, were you told where Haydara

   6   or Abu Mohamed the American was going next?

   7   A   Abu Mohamed or Haydara told me that he is going to Jihad

   8   Wal camp so as to give another military course to the trainers

   9   there.

   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, there is a slight

   2   logistical bump in the next exhibit.  This might be a

   3   convenient breaking point.

   4            THE COURT:  We will have our luncheon break and we

   8   matters that we need to take up in the robing room at some

   9   point and I want to alert your Honor --

  10            THE COURT:  Is there any reason not to do it now?

   1            (In the robing room)

   2            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald.

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.  There are two issues.  One, I

   4   believe counsel were given a letter this morning about some

   5   topics, in limine issues that we assume the defense did not

   6   want the government to get into.

   7            THE COURT:  That is your letter of February 21, which

   8   we will mark Court Exhibit A of today's date.

   9            MR. COHN:  We haven't seen it.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  I thought it was handed out today.

  11            MR. COHN:  You may have handed it out selectively but

  12   you ignored some of us.

  13            THE COURT:  Mr. Cohn, do you want to borrow mine?

  14            MR. COHN:  Thank you, your Honor.

  15            MR. RUHNKE:  There was a lot of paper handed out this

  16   morning, to be fair.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think the topic was the killing of

  18   the son of Abu Faraj al Yemeni.  I assume you were taking the

  19   same position as before with al-Fadl, that we should not get

  20   into that incident, but I want to make sure.

  21            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, we don't plan to go into that, your

  22   Honor.  Just for a comment on the letter, the Ramzi Yousef

  23   issue, it wasn't our intention to go into the World Trade

  24   Center bombing, just the use of the name Ramzi Yousef by the

  25   last witness, to try to make him salable to the Americans.  So



                                                                1152



   1   the government misstates our purpose in its letter.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, had we known we were

   3   doing that, we would have elicited the comment about the

   4   mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing that counsel

   5   listed.  If it is off limits, we should have that clear from

   6   the get-go.

   7            MR. WILFORD:  On this issue Mr. Fitzgerald is talking

   8   about now, I am not prepared to give an answer now on that.

   9   Do you plan to do it this afternoon?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Which one?

  11            MR. WILFORD:  The killing of the son of Abu Faraj --

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  I will leave it out and we can go

  13   over it at the end of the day.

  14            MR. BAUGH:  You don't expect to finish today?

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  No.  The second was the attack of

  16   the former king of Afghanistan in Italy.  Some people

  17   affiliated with al Qaeda stabbed the former king of

  18   Afghanistan while he was living in exile in Italy.  I believe

  19   one of them was arrested, and this person, Abu Mohamed, the

  20   American, which is Ali Mohamed, was sent to Italy to

  21   investigate and was frustrated in his investigation and

  22   brought back articles from the Italian newspaper concerning

  23   the event of a stabbing of the king of Afghanistan and brought

  24   them back to Nairobi, and this witness, I believe, may have

  25   translated some of them.



                                                                1153



   1            The whole question is, do we want to get into the

   2   episode of the killing of the former king of Afghanistan or

   3   not.

   4            MR. BAUGH:  We have no plans.

   5            MR. WILFORD:  No.

   6            THE COURT:  You have others?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, if I could peek over your

   8   Honor's shoulder.

   9            The witness was at one point asked to prepare himself

  10   to get a visa to go to Saudi Arabia.  He got the visa and was

  11   not asked to go to Saudi Arabia, but at the time he observed

  12   an Egyptian person who was not a pilot debriefing a friend of

  13   his, Ihab Ali, about how air traffic control works and what

  14   people say over the air traffic control system, and it was his

  15   belief that there might have been a plan to send a pilot to

  16   Saudi Arabia or someone familiar with that to monitor the air

  17   traffic communications so they could possibly attack an

  18   airplane perhaps belonging to an Egyptian president or

  19   something in Saudi Arabia.  He is not certain of that.

  20            I just want to know if that is something that you

  21   wish to examine on or not.

  22            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, for the record, I have gone

  23   through this and Mr. El Hage does not wish to go into any of

  24   this.

  25            MR. COHN:  To shortcircuit, if you want to make a



                                                                1154



   1   record of what the letter is, neither does Al-'Owhali.

   2            MR. RUHNKE:  Nor do we on behalf of K.K. Mohamed.

   3            THE COURT:  So as to Odeh you are reserving on the

   4   first item, the killing of the son of Abu Mohamed Faraj al

   5   Yemeni.

   6            MR. WILFORD:  We would also like to reserve on the

   7   item subheaded the death of a Kenyan intelligence officer.

   8   Thus, the first and the last we would like to reserve on.

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  The death of the Kenyan intelligence

  10   officer I think would come up in the afternoon in the course

  11   of events.  If Mr. Wilford would tell us -- that is the first

  12   set of redactions.

  13            THE COURT:  When you say redactions, you mean areas

  14   that you have agreed not to examine on direct and which except

  15   as to the first and last items where Mr. Wilford has reserved,

  16   other defendants have indicated that they do not intend to

  17   raise the topics.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  The next issue may involve

  19   classified information, so I don't know if everyone here is

  20   cleared.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  May I proceed, Judge.

   5            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald, you may proceed.

   6   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   7   Q   Mr. Kherchtou, let me ask you if you're familiar with?

   8

   9   anyone in al Qaeda who used the following names or nicknames?

  10   Hajj, or Ba Hajj?

  11   A   Hajj means Usama Bin Laden.

  12   Q   And that would be H-A-J-J.

  13            How about the word the name for director.  The

  14   director?

  15   A   Same thing.  You can say Usama Bin Laden.

  16   Q   Sorry?

  17   A   I said sometimes Bin Laden can call him the director, but

  18   I've never called him.

  19   Q   And when you say Abu Abdullah the director, which Abu

  20   Abdullah?

  21   A   Usama Bin Laden.

  22   Q   Can we display the photograph we qued up before the lunch

  23   break which I believe is 403R.

  24            Sir, do you recognize the person in Government

  25   Exhibit 403R?


<P>
                                                                1156



   1   A   I don't have anything on my screen.

   2   Q   We'll get I a copy of 403R.  First, if you can keep your

   3   voice up again so that everyone in the room can hear and that

   4   requires probably getting as close to the microphone as you

   5   can.

   6            Do you recognize the person depicted in Government

   7   Exhibit 403R as in Robert?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   Can you tell the jury who that is?

  10   A   Abu Mohamed al Amriki or Haydara.

  11   Q   I believe 403R is already in evidence so I ask that you

  12   display that to the jury.

  13            Is that the same Abu Mohammed who taught you and the

  14   others the surveillance training in Pakistan?

  15   A   Yes.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, we would offer 403R.  I

  17   thought it was offered in evidence.

  18            THE COURT:  Received.

  19            (Government's Exhibit 403R received in evidence)

  20   Q   Is that the same Abu Mohamed al Amriki who taught you

  21   surveillance training in Pakistan that you described before

  22   lunch?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   Now, did there come a time when you were asked to undergo

  25   a different type of training in Pakistan?



                                                                1157



   1   A   Well, after this training of surveillance a friend of mine

   2   who was in the same group, he's, I don't remember his

   3   nickname, he told me if I can go with him to study

   4   electronics.

   5   Q   And did you go to study electronics?

   6   A   Yes.  Al Qaeda at that time they have a workshop in

   7   Hyatabad, I think it was in Fey Street in Hyatabad.  So I went

   8   there.  There were two guys were working there in that

   9   workshop.

  10   Q   And who are the two guys working in the al Qaeda

  11   electronics workshop in Hyatabad?

  12   A   Well, they called Abu al Alkali and another guy called

  13   Salem the Iraqui.

  14   Q   So one name is Abu ABU-AL-ALKALI.

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   And the second one is S-A-L-E-M, the Iraqi?

  17   A   Yes.

  18   Q   Abu al Alkali do you know what country he was from?

  19   A   Egyptian.

  20   Q   Can you tell us what you did?  Did you actually go to this

  21   workshop?

  22   A   Yes.  I went to the workshop to start electronics but they

  23   found out that I don't know anything about electronics, and

  24   they told me just to study from the beginning and to recognize

  25   start knowing the different components, and I stayed there



                                                                1158



   1   some times until another guy came a Jordanian guy came and he

   2   found me there.  He asked me if I am engineer or what I'm

   3   doing in this workshop.  I said I'm not engineer and he told

   4   me, why don't you go to the institute to study as a student.

   5   He told me the institute was in Bebi, it's another place in

   6   Peshawar.

   7   Q   B-E-B-I?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   Did you go to the electronics institute in Bebi?

  10   A   Yes.  I didn't have time to stay in that institute but I

  11   went to the institute.  I brought courses because the

  12   electronics courses was divided in many phases, three phases

  13   or four phases.  So they gave me first one.  I studied at

  14   home, and everyday go to the work shop, and after two months

  15   every two months I go to sit for the exam.

  16   Q   How long in total do you estimate that you spent working

  17   in the workshop where Abu al Alkali works?

  18   A   I'm not quite sure, but it's over than six months.

  19   Q   And how many times did you go to the electronics institute

  20   in Bebi?

  21   A   Well, many times but not sometimes for the exam, sometimes

  22   to visit the institute.

  23   Q   Did you ever graduate from the electronics institute?

  24   A   No.

  25   Q   And what type of things were going on in the al Qaeda



                                                                1159

   3   they were working everyday there, and many oscilloscopes and

   4   machines, and they were talking about code and decoders and

   5   about things that I don't know exactly.

   6   Q   What were they discussing in your presence that they were

   7   working on?

   8   A   Well, by then I understand they are controls about

   9   decoders.

  10            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I object to the foundation.

  11   Q   Did they discuss remote controls in front of you?

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  I object for foundation purposes.  It's

  14   Q   Let me focus a few questions.

  15            THE COURT:  Restate the question.

  22   led you to believe that?

  23   A   Well, it was my instructor and the guy was a student in

  24   the same class with me, so it's normal that I understand what

  25   they are doing.  It's very obvious.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection.  Your Honor could we have a

  10   foundation before --

  11            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  12   Q   At that time was there a discussion of who the enemies of

  13   al Qaeda were?

  14   A   That time --

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.

  16            THE COURT:  No, overruled.

  17   Q   You may answer.

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  Discussion with whom?

  20            THE COURT:  Let him answer that question and then the

  21   next question will be to identify with whom.

  22   Q   The question was, did you have an understanding of who al

  23   Qaeda's enemies were at that time?

  24            THE COURT:  The question was, did you have

  25   discussions concerning the enemies of al Qaeda?



                                                                1194



   1   Q   Did you have discussions with al Qaeda members at that

   2   time or prior to that time as to who the enemies of al Qaeda

   3   were?

   4            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor, at that time or

   5   prior to that time.  We're talking about 1991 I guess on?

   6            THE COURT:  We're talking about the period to the end

   7   of '94, '95 when you were in Nairobi, and you had these

   8   visitors.

   9            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

  10   Q   Prior to those visits, did you have any discussions with

  11   al Qaeda members where it was indicated who the enemies of al

  12   Qaeda were at that time?

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.  That's a

  14   different question than your Honor stated.

  15            THE COURT:  Prior to that time is open ended.  There

  16   comes a time the witness has testified in the end of '94 and

  17   '95 when he has this apartment and that he has these visitors.

  18            Now we're asking about discussions held during their

  19   visits.

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  Before.  I'm asking the witness his

  21   understanding of who he understood as a member of al Qaeda the

  22   enemies of al Qaeda were prior to that visit.

  23            THE COURT:  During the period, prior to?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  From 1993 when he arrives in Nairobi

  25   October, 1993, until the time when these people visited his



                                                                1195



   1   apartment, did he have discussions with al Qaeda members as to

   2   who the enemies of al Qaeda were at that time.

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I have an objection.  I

   4   haven't objected to the number two or special, I don't know

   5   which one it is.  May we approach on this, your Honor?

   6            THE COURT:  I really think it's taking a lot of time

   7   on something that should not occupy so much time.  Try it

   8   again.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I still have that

  10   objection.  I think that I would request that we confer on my

  11   objection.

  12            THE COURT:  Excuse us for a moment, ladies and

  13   gentlemen.  Stay where you are.

   9   A   Yes.

  10   Q   Can you explain to the jury the circumstances which led to

  11   the arrest of Khalid al Fawwaz.

  12   A   Well, it was Ramadan.  I mean the fasting month for

  13   Muslims.  One of the evenings Khalid al Fawwaz came to my

  14   apartment with another guy called Abu Ammar al Suri.

  15   Q   Does that mean he is from Syria?

  16   A   Yes.

  17   Q   You mentioned it was the month of Ramadan.  Do you recall

  18   the year?

  19   A   I am not.  I don't remember.

  20   Q   Was it before or after the persons Abu Mohamed al Amriki,

  21   Anas al Liby and Hamza al Liby were developing photographs

  22   from negatives in your apartment, if you remember?

  23   A   It was after.

  24   Q   What happened when Abu Ammar al Suri and Khalid al Fawwaz

  25   visited your apartment?



                                                                1199



   1   A   He brought Abu Ammar al Suri to my apartment, saying that

   2   he is leaving, he is traveling to Europe from Kenya, and we

   3   had breakfast together, and Abu Ammar was saying that in the

   4   next day they will go to book for the flight to Europe, to

   5   Spain, but through, I think, Amsterdam or Germany.

   6            In the next day, I went to school and they went to

   7   book the flight.  Now they will explain me how it went.  Abu

   8   Ammar told me how they booked for their flight to Europe.  Abu

   9   Ammar was saying that they went to, whether Lufthansa first or

  10   KLM, one of them, they went there, and he and Khalid Fawwaz

  11   together, and they asked us to book first, to go to book for

  12   Europe, and the lady working in that office, in that agency,

  13   told them that the accountant is not here yet but I think she

  14   took their passport, she made photocopy for his passport.  And

  15   she told him to come back after 2:00, the accountant will be

  16   there.  Abu Ammar was carrying a Danish passport and Khalid

  17   has a beard, and they were talking at the agency in Arabic.  I

  18   think that lady has some suspicions in that idea, that's why

  19   she told them to come back at 2:00.

  20            After that we realized that we had done a mistake.

  21   Then we changed the agency, they went to other one, whether

  22   Lufthansa or KLM, I don't remember.  The other one, they got a

  23   ticket normally, without any problem.  They came in the

  24   afternoon and told me that they had our ticket and he is

  25   leaving, I think through Amsterdam.  When he told me that



                                                                1200



   1   issue, I told him probably will face some problems.  But he

   2   didn't care.  And it was, I think, 9:00.  Khalid Fawwaz came

   3   and took Abu Ammar al Suri to the airport.  When Abu Ammar al

   4   Suri reached the airport and he is starting making the

   5   check-in, he gave his passport and ticket to that lady so as

   6   to make the check-in, and there is a guy came out from the

   7   office just behind that lady, and he started talking to Abu

   8   Ammar in Danish language, and Abu Ammar couldn't answer him,

   9   and he started speaking English, and he told him how did you

  10   get this passport, and he told him that I am married with a

  11   Danish lady, and he gave him the name of that lady.  The guy

  12   went back, starts to check in the computer if he is really

  13   married to that lady.  He give him a name.  And one of the

  14   other Danish people -- there were two -- they went to the door

  15   of the airport, one of the gates, he told the guy, one of the

  16   security guards, he told him don't let these guys go out from

  17   the airport.  But Khalid Fawwaz, he managed to go out, and he

  18   told to Abu Ammar al Suri, if you can just leave the airport,

  19   I will bring the car in front of the door and I will just

  20   leave.

  21            That's what happened.  Abu Ammar was talking to the

  22   guy, was going to his computer again, until he found a way to

  23   leave.  He found the car of the guy waiting him, and they

  24   left.

  25   Q   A question to make clear.  You said that Abu Ammar had a



                                                                1201



   1   Danish passport.  Did you understand that to be a real Danish

   2   passport or a fake Danish passport?

   3   A   It was a fake one.

   4   Q   Did you see Abu Ammar after he left the airport?

   5   A   Yes.  I was preparing myself to sleep, it was around

   6   11:00, and I heard a knocking my door, my apartment.  I opened

   7   the door.  I knew that Abu Ammar is coming back.  When I saw

   8   him, I told him why did you come here, why did you not go to

   9   hotel or something.  He told me that Hamad brought me here.

  10   Q   So we are clear, who is Hamad?

  11   A   I said Hamad is Khalid al Fawwaz.

  12   Q   What happened then?

  13   A   The first thing, I went down to the phone, I called Hamad

  14   in his home.  I told him why did you bring this guy here, he

  15   has a problem now, I mean, you create a problem for me.  He

  16   told me don't worry, I check, when he was coming to your

  17   apartment I circled many times, nobody was following me, don't

  18   worry.  He said it's OK.  So he came to my apartment, spend

  19   the night there.

  20            In the morning after the first prayer, after the dawn

  21   prayer, I was there in my apartment with Abdel Hameed, who was

  22   living with me, and there was another guy, Abu Khalid el Masry

  23   or Abu Jihad al Nubi.  He was there in a visit with us.

  24   Q   Is that the person whose photograph you identified earlier

  25   known as Mustafa?



                                                                1202



   1   A   Yes.

   2   Q   What happened in the morning?

   3   A   In the morning I told to Khalid, Abu Khalid, now we have

   4   the passport, you can go to any hotel to book for you and take

   5   Abu Mohamed with you, we don't need him in this apartment.  He

   6   was scared and said no, I won't take him.

   7   Q   Who said?

   8   A   Mustafa.

   9   Q   Stop and tell us about the conversation that Abdel Hameed

  10   had with you.

  11   A   Abdel Hameed, who was living with me, told me that

  12   yesterday something happened I didn't tell you.  I told him

  13   what happened, he told me that he received a call from Sheik

  14   Bailala yesterday.

  15   Q   Could you explain to the jury who Sheik Bailala is.

  16   A   Sheik Bailala is one of the opposition in Kenya.  He is

  17   living in Mombasa, and when I was in Kenya he is making lot of

  18   problem for the government, demonstrations and so.  That guy,

  19   Sheik Bailala, when he was student he was studying in Saudi

  20   Arabia and he knew Abdel Hameed in Saudi Arabia, knew his

  21   family.  I don't know how he called Saudi Arabia, and he was

  22   asking about Abdel Hameed.  His family told him Abdel Hameed

  23   is in Kenya, he is there, and they gave my apartment phone

  24   number.  That's why he called.  He found Abdel Hameed.  When

  25   he received the call he knew that Sheik Bailala called him.



                                                                1203



   1   He said OK, thank you, I will call you back.  He doesn't want

   2   to talk on the phone.  That's why his phone was traced later

   3   on.

   4            Anyway, in the morning, what we have done is we took

   5   all things that they can -- I mean phone numbers or whatever

   6   is suspicious in our apartment, we burned everything, because

   7   I was afraid that, for example, next day the photograph of a

   8   bomber will be in all newspapers and if they find him in

   9   apartment they will check in the apartment and they will

  10   create some problems for me.

  11            So I went, next day I went to school normally and I

  12   left behind me Abu Ammar and Abdel Hameed.  On the way back

  13   from the school -- I finished, I think, my course at 5:00.

  14   Then I took, instead of taking the bus from downtown to my

  15   apartment I just walk because I was fasting, just I was

  16   walking until 6:00, then I will just arrive at that time.

  17            When I reached my apartment, I found the neighbor, my

  18   neighbors, they are living just next door, they told me what

  19   happened to your brother, they are talking about Abdel Hameed.

  20   They said what happened, they told me two security people they

  21   came and they took him, and they were just waiting for you,

  22   they have just left now.

  23            So at that time I took my things.  I didn't even get

  24   in the room.  I went down.  I tried to call Khalid Fawwaz to

  25   tell him what happened.  Nobody was answering the phone, and I



                                                                1204



   1   thought that they caught him too.  From there I went to

   2   another guy called Abu Kheir al Yemeni.

   3   Q   Is that the same Abu Kheir al Yemeni you mentioned was the

   4   accountant for the emergency relief agency before?

   5   A   Yes.

   6   Q   What did you do when you went to see Abu Kheir?

   7   A   I went to him, I told him what happened, and we had

   8   breakfast.  I was fasting.  I had breakfast with him.  I think

   9   after an hour I went out again.  I called Khalid Fawwaz.  I

  10   got him.  I told him what happened.  He already knew the story

  11   because he told me Abdel Hameed called him from the jail or

  12   let somebody call him from the jail, and he told me that what

  13   happened.  He told me don't worry, tomorrow morning we will go

  14   together, Khalid Fawwaz and me, to see what happened to Abdel

  15   Hameed in the police station.

  16   Q   The following morning did you go with Khalid Fawwaz to the

  17   police station?

  18   A   Yes, I went to see Abdel Hameed in Kililishwa police

  19   station.

  20   Q   What happened when you got to the police station?

  21   A   When we got to the police station, I stayed in the car

  22   outside and Khalid Fawwaz went to the police station to ask

  23   about Abdel Hameed.  In the front desk he told him he wants to

  24   talk about Hameed, what's going on for him.  The guy asked

  25   what is your name, and he said my name is Hameed.  At that



                                                                1205



   1   time he told him we are looking for Hameed.  He took him there

   2   and he started screaming and stuff, and he called one of the

   3   police ladies there, they called me from the car, and they

   4   give me a bunch of papers and things that he has in his

   5   pockets, and they told me to go to see the lawyer and tell him

   6   what happened.

   7   Q   When he said the lawyer, what lawyer was he referring to?

   8   A   He had a lawyer before, the same lawyer who was working on

   9   the registration of the company, of ASMA company.

  10   Q   Do you know the name of the lawyer who was working on the

  11   registration of the company, what his name was?

  12   A   Yes.  He was Mr. Chaudry.

  13   Q   Did you go to see Mr. Chaudry?

  14   A   Yes, I did.  I saw him.

  15   Q   What happened then?

  16   A   I saw Mr. Chaudry and I explained him everything, and

  17   before that when I met Khalid Fawwaz, he told me that Hamad

  18   called him and he told him, he explained him what happened to

  19   Abdel Hameed and Abu Ammar.  The two security men they came to

  20   my apartment, Abu Ammar opened the door for them and they

  21   wanted to talk to him but they don't speak English, so they

  22   took him and they think in the midway they realize, they go

  23   back to the apartment to look for something.  They came back

  24   to the apartment and they were looking for something, they

  25   found Ammar there in the apartment, and he was scared from



                                                                1206



   1   yesterday, because he fled from the airport, and he was

   2   waiting that somebody was looking for him.  His passport was

   3   there, his photograph was there.  When they told him what are

   4   you doing here, he told them yes, what happened, even though

   5   they didn't know what happened, but he told them.  They took

   6   him, he had another case, because he came to Kenya illegally.

   7   He was sentenced later, I think, for four months.

   8   Q   At this point Abdul Hameed is in jail, Abu Ammar al Suri

   9   is in jail, and Khalid al Fawwaz is in jail, right?

  10   A   Yes.

  11   Q   What happened next?

  12   A   I contacted the lawyer, who told me he is going to see

  13   what he will do, and I contacted another friend called Tawhil.

  14   Q   Do you know what kind of name Tawhil is?  Is it an Arabic

  15   name or something else?

  16   A   Tawhil is a Arabic name, means the taller.

  17   Q   Does Ahmed Tawhil go by any other name?

  18   A   His real name is Ahmed Sheikh Aden.

  19   Q   Ahmed Sheikh Aden.  What happened when you went to see

  20   Ahmed Tawhil?

  21   A   I told him exactly what happened to all those three

  22   people, and he doesn't want to help in the beginning, but he

  23   helped us to find some solution to get out these people from

  24   the jail.  I forget something, but when those security people

  25   came to my apartment, when they were checking there they took



                                                                1207



   1   my money, took around $1,600, and they took some other Kenyan

   2   money that we kept for food, and they took my passport and my

   3   pupil pass and everything, and they were looking for me too,

   4   because the apartment was on my name.  They wanted to know how

   5   this call came to me.

   6   Q   If I could stop you a moment.  You mentioned a pupil pass.

   7   What is a pupil pass?

   8   A   It's a permit to study in Kenya.  It was for the CMC

   9   flying school.

  10   Q   Does that give you immigration status in Kenya, allowing

  11   you to be in the country?

  12   A   Yes.

  13   Q   What did Ahmed Tawhil do to help the three people who were

  14   in jail?

  15   A   He contacted a friend of his, he is security guy working

  16   with the Kenyan security, and that guy, he went to Abdel

  17   Hameed and Fawwaz to see what happened, what is their problem,

  18   and he even saw Ammar al Suri.

  19   Q   Do you know the name of the guy that Ahmed Tawhil

  20   contacted in the Kenyan security?

  21   A   Yes.

  22   Q   What was his name?

  23   A   I knew only his first name, Ali.

  24   Q   When you say Kenyan security, what do you mean?

  25   A   Intelligence.



                                                                1208



   1   Q   What happened next?

   2   A   What happened is, I was behind the lawyer and Ahmed

   3   Tawhil, both of them.  The lawyer told me that he saw some

   4   people there and they need some money.

   5   Q   What did he indicate to you they needed the money for?

   6   A   It was clear.  It's a bribe for us to take these people

   7   from the jail.

   8   Q   Did the lawyer tell you how much money was needed to pay

   9   the bribe to get them out of jail?

  10   A   He didn't tell me it's a bribe but he tell me these guys

  11   need money and they need $3,000.

  12   Q   When he talked to you about the $3,000, did you discuss

  13   this with anyone else?

  14   A   Well, the money, I didn't have money but I have to take

  15   the OK from Sudan, because in Nairobi at that time, Khalid

  16   Fawwaz was in jail, can say something, only Abu Ubaidah, in

  17   that period he was in Sudan.  I called and told him what

  18   happened to these guys.  He told me don't think about money,

  19   if there is any problem give them money to take these guys

  20   from jail.

  21   Q   Did you actually pay the $3,000 to the attorney?

  22   A   Yes, I did.

  23   Q   Do you know where you got the $3,000 from?

  24   A   I think it's from, I took it from Abu al Kheir al Yemeni.

  25   Q   What happened after you paid the $3,000 to the attorney?



                                                                1209



   1   A   I gave him that money.  I don't know what happened, but he

   2   told me that he saw these people and they want to sit with me,

   3   to interrogate me.  After I think 12 days, then I went with

   4   the lawyer to where the Kenyan intelligence are in Niayo

   5   houses it was, I think, in 24th floor.  We met responsible guy

   6   there, and he asked me some questions briefly.  Then he told

   7   me to go with other two, other people to another room, and

   8   they were starting questioning me why did I come to Kenya and

   9   how did I rent that house, and who is Abdel Hamad, how did you

  10   meet that Abu Ammar, who is Khalid Fawwaz -- questions like

  11   this.

  12   Q   Did they ask you anything about the relief agencies, if

  13   you recall?

  14   A   I don't remember.

  15   Q   At the end of the interview, were you arrested or did you

  16   go free?

  17   A   No.  The first day they questioned me and they let me go.

  18   They told me because I was insisting on that money they took

  19   from my apartment, and they told me you can go now to your

  20   apartment and tomorrow come back.  I was awaiting my passport.

  21   I went there.  I found everything was checked in my apartment.

  22   The next day 3:00 I came and they gave me the passport -- I

  23   stayed there from 3 to 5:00 waiting until they gave me my

  24   passport, and at the same time they released Abdel Hameed and

  25   Khalid Fawwaz.



                                                                1210



   1   Q   So at this point Khalid al Fawwaz was free and Abu Abdel

   2   Hamad was free.  Where was Abu Ammar al Suri, the person with

   3   the fake Danish passport?  Where was he at this point?

   4   A   He was in jail because his case is different than ours.

   5   That's why he was taken to jail.

   6   Q   Did there come a time when Khalid al Fawwaz left Kenya?

   7   A   Yes.  After this incident, not too much, then he left.

   8   Q   Where did he go?

   9   A   He went to Sudan.

  10   Q   Do you know if he went from the Sudan to anyplace else

  11   after that?

  12   A   I know he went to London after that.

  13   Q   Khalid al Fawwaz had been your boss in Nairobi when he was

  14   there?

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   Was he ever replaced as your boss when he left?

  17   A   Yes.  When Khalid Fawwaz left, Wadih el Hage came.

  18   Q   Do you know Wadih el Hage?

  19   A   Yes, I know.

  20   Q   I ask you to look around the courtroom, tell us if you

  21   recognize him.

  22   A   Yes, I do.

  23   Q   Can you tell us where he is sitting?

  24   A   He is in front of there.

  25   Q   Can you describe what he is wearing?



                                                                1211



   1   A   I don't know the color of the jacket but he is --

   2   Q   Do you see a lady with glasses at the end of the table?

   3   Can you tell us where he is sitting in relation to the lady

   4   with glasses.

   5   A   The second one after the lady.

   6            THE COURT:  The record will indicate that the witness

   7   has identified the defendant El Hage, and we will take a

   8   recess at this point.

                                                                1213



   1   Q   What happened when you came back from the Sudan?

   2   A   I lived in a hotel which was the same first guesthouse

   3   when I came the first time to Kenya.  That guesthouse became a

  23   Q   In whose name was the house rented?

  24   A   I don't remember.  I know him, but I forget his name.

  25   Q   Who signed the lease?

   1   A   Wadih El Hage.

   2   Q   Where was the house located?

   3   A   It's in Nairobi, but not far from Jomo Kenyatta Airport.

   4   It's 10 kilometers from Nairobi.

   5   Q   Can you describe what the grounds of the house looked

   6   like.

   7   A   It's small villa, I can say, small villa.  It has two

   8   parts.  The main one, he was living there, and there is

   9   another room and bathroom and a small garage after, behind

  10   that house.

  11   Q   Is that all part of one building or are there two separate

  12   buildings?

  13   A   Well, I mean everything inside one mall but the main one

  14   in which Wadih was living and the other one just behind it.

  15   Q   When you and Wadih El Hage lived in the room in the hotel

  16   and then Wadih el Hage rented a house, where did you live

  17   after that point in time?

  18   A   At that time I don't remember exactly because it was the

  19   end of my studying in flying school exams, and I moved to

  20   Wadih El Hage's place, in the back of his house.  I was living

  21   there.

  22   Q   Did there come a time when you saw the person Abu Mohamed

  23   al Amriki in Nairobi again?

   1   Mohamed al Amriki once again.

   2   A   I don't remember exactly when he came there, but he came

   3   and we met each other in the same place, in Wadia's house.

   4   Q   Was this the next time you saw him after he came with Anas

   5   al Liby and Hamza Al Liby to develop pictures?

   6   A   I think this is the second time, yes.

   7   Q   Did you discuss what it was that Abu Mohamed al Amriki was

   8   going to do next?

   9   A   After certain time he told me that Abu Hafs, the

  10   commander, wanted me and Abu Mohamed to go to Senegal.

  11   Q   Did Abu Mohamed al Amriki say why it was that Abu Hafs,

  12   the commander, wanted to send the two of you to Senegal?

  13   A   They needed some surveillers to make surveillance for

  14   French targets there in Senegal.

  15   Q   Did you understand why it was that they wanted to have you

  16   surveil French targets in Senegal?

  17   A   Because France was against the Muslims in Algeria and

  18   Usama Bin Laden said once in one of the meetings that he was

  19   helping Algerians, and in my opinion it was --

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection.

  21            THE COURT:  Yes, sustained.

  22   Q   Withhold your opinion.

  23            Where was it that Abu Mohamed al Amriki told you that

  24   Abu Hafs wanted you and Abu Mohamed al Amriki to go to

  25   Senegal?



                                                                1216



   1   A   In the same place in the back of the house, Wadia's house.

   2   Q   What if anything did you and Abu Mohamed al Amriki do to

   3   prepare to go to Senegal?

   4   A   The first thing he was visiting with me, the French

   5   Cultural Center, he was learning some French, and we bought

   6   some maps and some books about Senegal.

   7   Q   Did you expect to go to Senegal to do surveillance?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   Did you in fact go to Senegal to do surveillance?

  10   A   No.

  11   Q   Tell us why you didn't go.

  12   A   Because after that, Mohamed Amriki received a call from

  13   United States, from a friend of his from here, saying that he

  14   had some problem here and he should come back so as to resolve

  15   these problems.

   1   Q   Stop there a moment.  You mentioned that a friend in the

   2   United States called Abu Mohamed al Amriki.  Do you know the

   3   friend in the United States who called him?

   4   A   Mohamed told me his name was --

   5            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection.

   6            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   7   Q   Answer this question yes or no.  Did Abu Mohamed tell you

   8   the name of the person who had called him from the United

   9   States to give him this message?

  10   A   Yes.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would now ask for him

  12   to tell us what the name was.

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection.

  14            THE COURT:  I am sorry.  Counsel and the reporter.

  15            (In the corridor)

  16            THE COURT:  What is the answer going to be?

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Adam, A-D-A-M, as in Adam and Eve.

  18            THE COURT:  And the relevance is what?

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  Because the witness will describe

  20   that Wadih calls Ali Mohamed at Wadih el Hage's house to tell

  21   Ali Mohamed that Ali Mohamed has a problem with American

  22   intelligence or security and needs to return to America.  Ali

  23   Mohamed says OK, I will leave Nairobi and Wadih El Hage's

  24   house and go back to America to deal with this problem.  He

  25   then leaves and doesn't come back.  He cancels the Senegal



                                                                1218



   1   surveillance.

   2            When he goes back to America, December 1994, he is

   3   interviewed by an FBI agent, Ali Mohamed, in regard to the

   4   upcoming trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman.  The date of the

   5   interview is December 9, 1994.  The person he knows is Adam

   6   can be corroborated that Adam turns out to be a friend of Ali

   7   Mohamed's wife.  The phone records show a telephone call from

   8   Ali Mohamed or his friend to Wadih El Hage's house in Nairobi,

   9   Kenya, in November '94, prior to the December 9, 1994

  10   interview.

  11            In addition, following the December 9, 1994,

  12   interview, Ali Mohamed is then corresponding by phone with the

  13   FBI agent in New York -- we have the toll records.

  14            THE COURT:  Adam is otherwise identified somehow?

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Not yet.

  16            THE COURT:  But will be identified?

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  We hope to identify him as Khalid

  18   Mohamed, a friend of Ali Mohamed's in California.

  19            THE COURT:  And a member of al Qaeda?

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  A member -- associate of Al Jihad,

  21   but not a member of al Qaeda.  The point being, it will

  22   corroborate that he received a phone call in Wadih Hage's

  23   home.  It shows that when Ali Mohamed needs to go back to

  24   America, they contact him at Wadia's house.

  25            THE COURT:  Is this being offered for the truth or



                                                                1219



   1   that the words were spoken?

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Both.

   3            MR. COHN:  Can I ask a question as to curiosity?

   4   This fellow isn't part of the conversation?

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  Ali Mohamed tells this fellow Adam

   6   called and says you have to go back to America.

   7            MR. COHN:  It is not a conversation between Adam and

   8   Ali Mohamed.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  The existence of the call may be

  10   relevant.  That can be proved not by hearsay, it can be proved

  11   by the phone records.  I don't know why we are having hearsay

  12   of someone who is not part of the hearsay.

  13            THE COURT:  I don't either.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Ali Mohamed was part of the jihad --

  15   your Honor, if the name Adam is kryptonite, we will move on

  16   from that.

  17            THE COURT:  Let's move on.

   1            (In open court)

   2   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   3   Q   Mr. Kherchtou, Abu Mohamed al Amriki told you that someone

   4   had a problem in America that they had to address, correct?

   5   A   Yes.

   6   Q   Who had the problem in America?

   7   A   No.  He told me that he has some problems in America

   8   himself.

   9   Q   Referring to Abu Mohamed al Amriki?

  10   A   Yes.

  11   Q   What did he say he was going to do about it?

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.

  13            THE COURT:  No, overruled.  What did he say to you?

  14   A   He told me that the guy in United States called him and --

  15            THE COURT:  No, no.  Tell us what he told you he was

  16   going to do.

  17   A   He has to come here so as to resolve these problems

  18   himself.

  19   Q   Do you know, first of all, where was Abu Mohamed al Amriki

  20   when he told you about the situation?

  21   A   Where, in the same place in Wadia's house, in the back.

  22   Q   Do you know where he received this call from -- not who

  23   called.  Do you know where he got the phone call from the

  24   person in America?

  25   A   In the phone, in the mobile phone.



                                                                1221



   1   Q   Mobile phone of who?

   2   A   Of Wadia.

   3   Q   Were you there when he received the call?

   4   A   Yes, I was there.

   5   Q   Did Abu Mohamed Amriki leave Kenya after that point?

   6   A   Yes, he left Kenya.

   7   Q   And did you ever see him after that point?

   8   A   No.

   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, is this where you wished

   2   to break for the day?

   3            THE COURT:  All right, we are adjourned until

   4   tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.  Have a good evening.  Please remember

   5   about not reading anything about the case.

   6            (Jury excused)

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  The two open issues at the end of

   8   the robing room conference at lunchtime are still open.  I

   9   think there is a disagreement among the defense.  We need to

  10   resolve that before we proceed from here on out.  The

  11   government takes no position as to whether we elicit either of

  12   those two topic areas.

  13            THE COURT:  This is 1 and 5 of the letter we marked

  14   as Court Exhibit A.  Do we have to do this in the robing room?

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  We probably should, Judge.

  16            MR. COHN:  I thought that was being held till

  17   tomorrow morning.

  18            THE COURT:  So we will do it in the robing room,

  19   after which we will adjourn.
