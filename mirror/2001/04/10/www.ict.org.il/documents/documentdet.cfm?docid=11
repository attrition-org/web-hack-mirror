<P><center><i>Test of the message of Hamas as presented to Mr. Yasser Arafat
during the discussion of Thursday, 18 June 1998</i></center>
<p>

<P><center><hr noshade size="1" width="30%"></center>

<P><CENTER><B><i>In The Name of Allah the Merciful</i></B></CENTER>

<P>We have called this meeting in order to emphasize the undertaking of
the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, of this discussion. This is vital
to the security of our militant Jihad for the implementation of our national
project for liberation, in the shadow of the escalation of the malicious
Zionist settlement attack on our land, our sanctuaries and on our people.
It is vital too, for the unity of our people before all political and theoretical
challenges. We aim at constructing a strong civil Palestinian society,
capable of overcoming all difficulties and of confronting the Zionist entity
on the land of Palestine, forcing its withdrawal.

<P>We emphasize that our acceptance to this meeting is not in any way linked
with consultations on the composition of the governmental council, which
is part of the evil Oslo Agreements, which have been rejected by our people
as well as by our movement. These agreements have no legitimacy in our
project of liberation--to eliminate the Zionist occupation of Palestine,
and the establishment of the independent Palestinian State whose capital
will be Jerusalem. We stress our adherence to the decision of the Palestinian
People and the Resistance, and our rejection of these agreements, which
have harmed our national unity and put an end to the popular uprising against
the Occupation.

<P>On this basis we present what is, in our view, the most essential issues
to the reform of the Palestinian actions.

<P><B>a. The political sphere</B>

<P>The past four years since the Oslo Agreements have proven that this
option was harmful and would not lead to the achievement of the Palestinian's
goals of being liberated from the Occupation. On the contrary, it may eternalize
the Occupation. Therefore, we call for the following measures:
<OL>
<LI>
A real reassessment and reevaluation of the Oslo Accords.</LI>

<LI>
Cessation of the negotiations, and of all security cooperation, with the
enemy.</LI>

<LI>
Implementation of the Palestinian people's decision in favor of the resistance
by recruiting and motivating the people to confront the Occupation, forcing
its withdrawal.</LI>

<LI>
Open a serious and comprehensive dialogue between all the Palestinian groups
both in Palestine and abroad, in order to establish a national project
to answer the needs of this stage of the struggle and to meet the expectations
of the Palestinian people of freedom and independence.</LI>

<LI>
Emphasize the Arab and Islamic dimensions of the Palestinian problem, employing
this positive element for the sake of our legitimate rights.</LI>
</OL>
<B>b. The internal situation</B>
<OL>
<LI>
To strengthen the national unity of the people in light of their various
political spheres and their different lines of thinking.</LI>

<LI>
To empower the Palestinian individual with self-determination and the assurance
of his human rights and political freedom.</LI>

<LI>
To secure the independence of the system of justice and the sovereignty
of the law.</LI>

<LI>
To put an end to the involvement of the security apparatus in civil life
and to all forms of harassment and oppression of the people.</LI>

<LI>
To release all the political prisoners in the Palestinian Authority's jails.</LI>

<LI>
To place priority on the issue of Palestinian prisoners in the jails of
the Occupation and the handling of all aspects pertaining to their release,
while supporting their families by assuring their wellbeing.</LI>

<LI>
To hold municipal elections in all provinces of the homeland in order to
improve the administration and rally all Palestinian circles in the struggle
for internal development.</LI>

<LI>
To reform the administration and to prosecute all those involved in corruption;
and to enforce the "<A HREF="#Note">How-do-you-own-this</A>?" Law on all
government employees.</LI>

<LI>
To grant equal opportunity of employment to all people and nominate people
according to their skills, integrity and ability, as to opposed to bribery
and "protection."</LI>

<LI>
To place priority on the education of the young, supplying their needs
and establishing the mode of education that will best preserve the moral,
vigor and the civilized nature of our Palestinian identity.</LI>

<LI>
To preserve the general morals of Islam, defending them from scorn and
negligence.</LI>
</OL>
<B>c. The Economy</B>
<OL>
<LI>
We call for the construction of a Palestinian economy, according to the
robust disciplines that will guarantee the preservation and independence
of this economy; assuring its development and the provision of employment
opportunities for everyone; and the effective use of its human resources
and revenues.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</OL>
<B>d. Society</B>
<OL>
<LI>
To reevaluate the role of the mosque in correct education and instilling
the lofty morals of a healthy society, and good citizenship for the best
interests of the nation. To ensure the appointment of the right Imams,
the freedom of Islamic activity and reappointment of the deposed Imams
of the Islamic Movement.</LI>

<LI>
To enlarge the number of social institutions in society, allowing them
the opportunity to fulfill their social role--that of providing for poor
families and fighting poverty. To allow the reopening the closed Islamic
institutes.</LI>

<LI>
To supervise the foreign institutions so that they will serve the philosophy
of society and its internal construction and keep its customs and legacy.</LI>

<LI>
To provide healthcare and develop the private and public health system.</LI>
</OL>
We pray to Allah for his guidance and the achievement of the wishes of
our people for liberation, for its legitimates rights and the establishment
of our independent state with its capital in Jerusalem, all over the Palestinian
national land.

<P>The above demands of Hamas are not new in the Palestinian arena in recent
years but the tone is different. Hamas uses here the tone of someone who
is now--more than in the past--willing to recognize and cooperate with
the Palestinian Authority. This may be a new attitude or even, a new policy.
This may be seen also by another fact--the nominee for the office of the
Minister of Religious Endowments (Wazir al-Awqaf) who will replace the
previous encumbent, is Jamil Hamami, until recently a prominent figure
of the Islamic Movement in the West Bank. Such a nomination will give Hamas
control over two major power centers in the West Bank and Jerusalem - the
Islamic religious establishment and the Aqsa Mosque, where there has been
in recent years a hostile competition between the Palestinian Authority
and the Jordanian regime.

<P>Hamas uses the usual Palestinian phrase, "the establishment of the independent
Palestinian State whose capital is Jerusalem". By this use, the Movement
actually--although indirectly--admits that the Palestinian Authority is
heading in that direction within the framework of the Oslo Accords. The
general spirit of the paper is one of reconciliation; rather than rivalry,
dispute or confrontation. At the same time, the Movement continues its
severe criticism of the PA over the murder of Muhi al-Din al-Sharif and
the continuing arrest of several leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip including
Dr. Abd al-`Aziz al-Rantisi.

<P>The considerable change in tone may be a consequence of Sheikh Ahmad
Yassin's return to the Movement's leadership, and his political recognition
of the existence of the Palestinian Authority as a fact, even though the
PA "was born of sin". This may reflect a more pragmatic attitude toward
the PA, influenced by a political sense of leadership, which favors opportunism
over confrontation. Sheikh Ahmad Yassin has assumed a powerful position
not only as the leader of Hamas, but his two-month long tour in the Arab
World, has shown him to be a Palestinian leader recognized by several Arab
States. Thus his demands are more logical and pragmatic, in keeping with
his traditional line of refrain from confrontation, as long as the PA enables
the Movement to carry out its main mission in the social, educational and
cultural fields.

<P>The demands of Hamas were presented to Arafat inthe framework of a Palestinian
attempt to bring together the various forces in the PA in some semblance
of unity and cooperation, on the background of the intention to establish
a new government. Arafat is trying to widen his support base by using both
the present stagnation in the political process with Israel, and what he
sees as American support for his position. Arafat is willing to pay a price
to the other forces, including Hamas. The price that Hamas demands here
is not as high as it was in the past.</font>
