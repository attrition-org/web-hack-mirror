   3   point.

   6            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, this witness, Mr. al Fadl,

   7   used two religious, Islamic religious terms, bayat and fatwah.

   8   We would respectfully request the court give the jury an

   9   instruction indicating that any Islamic or religious term that

  10   he uses or seeks to identify are simply as he deems them to be

  11   and not the understanding of what the words mean.  He did it

  12   in one instance, your Honor, and I don't believe he did it on

  13   the second.  I would ask that the court give a curative

  14   instruction to the jury so if any further terms come up they

  15   will understand.

  16            THE COURT:  Any objection?

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  No, Judge, as long as it is done

  18   neutrally, that he is endorsing that.

  19            THE COURT:  The jury understands that any definition

  20   that this witness has given with respect to the Islamic

  21   religious terms reflects this witness's understanding of those

  22   terms.

  23            MR. RICCO:  Exactly.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  That is fine.

                                                                226



   1            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I should advise you

   2   that when this witness furnished a definition of Islamic

   3   religious terms, you should understand that that reflects this

   4   witness's understanding of those terms.

   5            (Witness present)

   6            THE COURT:  Sir, please try to talk very slowly and

   7   right into the microphone.

   8            THE WITNESS:  OK.

   9            THE COURT:  I know it is hard.  Slow.

  10            THE WITNESS:  OK.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  If you could also move your chair up

  12   a bit and lean forward, it makes a big difference how close

  13   you are to the microphone.

  14            THE WITNESS:  OK.

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, at this point the

  16   government would like to display some exhibits on the screens

  17   for identification purposes only, which I believe means that

  18   for the moment nothing will be displayed to the public or to

  19   the jury.  The first exhibit we would like to display is

   9   A.  Yes, I understand.  Some scholars from Sunni and some

  10   scholars from Shia, they say the difference is 16 points, 16

  11   things make the difference between Sunni and Shia.

  12   Q.  Can you give us the example of one or two.

  13   A.  Like in Sunni, when somebody want to married, he need two

  14   witnesses, and the lady, she have to bring somebody from her

  15   family, like her dad or brother or uncle.  He should be

  16   present when they make the license for marriage.

  17            In Shia, they don't use that.  If the husband and the

  18   lady, they agree, they can do it without witness, and they can

  19   say we want a marriage for five years, and after five years

  20   we're going to see.  This is in Shia, they call it Zawaj al

  21   Muhda.

  22            And also the other difference, the Shia, they believe

  23   they don't want to make jihad until they wait for imam.

  24   Q.  I-M-A-M?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                287



   1   Q.  Can you explain to the jury your understanding of what an

   2   imam is.

   5   Q.  During the time that you were in the Sudan with al Qaeda,

   6   did you have any conversations with other members of al Qaeda

   7   about the relationship between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Can you tell us who spoke about that?

  10   A.  I remember Abu Fadhl al Makkee and Abu Hajer al Iraqi and

  11   Abu Fadhl al Iraqi.

  12   Q.  If we can focus on what Abu Hajer al Iraqi said first.

  13   A.  Abu Hajer, he believe, now we got one enemy, the westerns,

  14   and if we all the Muslims come together and unite together,

  15   they forget the problems and the differences between them,

  16   it's better for them to fight one enemy.  And he says the Shia

  17   and the Sunnis, they should come together for focusing in one

  18   enemy.

  19   Q.  In the Sudan, are most of the Muslims there Sunni or Shia?

  20   A.  Most of the Muslims Sunni.

  22   Muslims are?

   8   truck and we went to army base.

   9   Q.  The persons you were with were Abu Ayoub al Iraqi and

  10   Mohamed Jara al Nabi.  What did you do when the two of them

  11   and you went to the army base?

  12   A.  We stop over there outside until Mohamed Jara al Nabi and

  13   Abu Ayoub al Iraqi went inside, and they give paperwork for

  14   the army office and they came back and let us go in one of the

  15   hangar in army base.

   2   It all belong to the Sudanese army.

   3   Q.  You said at what time of day?

   6   A.  My analysis?

   7   Q.  What was your understanding at the time --

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.

   9   Q.  -- what the weapons were to be used for?

  10            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  12   foreign army and American army in east Saudi Arabia.

  14   or crates was ever used against the American military in Saudi

                                                                342



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I believe we have a

   2   stipulation with the defense from yesterday that it is not the

   3   government's contention that anything contained in those

   4   crates was ever in fact used against the American military in

   5   Saudi Arabia.

   6            THE COURT:  Very well.  So stipulated.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I am at a convenient

   8   breaking point.

   9            THE COURT:  Yes.  We will stop now.

  10            I remind you, a stipulation is an agreement between

  11   the parties that a certain fact is true, and so the parties

  12   have stipulated that these weapons were never used against

  13   Americans.

  14            We will call it a day, and tomorrow may be less than

  15   a full day.  I don't know exactly how late we will sit

  16   tomorrow.  I know it will not be a full day.

  17            Have a good evening.  Please remember what I said

  18   about not reading or listening to anything about the case.

  19            (Jury excused)

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, among the last questions

  21   answered by this witness was his speculation that the weapons

  22   were going to Saudi Arabia to be used against Americans,

  23   notwithstanding that he was told that it was going to Yemen.

  24   In our previous discussions it was my understanding that the

  25   witness was going to testify that he was told that it was



                                                                343



   1   going to Saudi Arabia, and then we had the stipulation that

   2   there was no proof that it would be used against the

   3   Americans.

   4            There is a difference between being told something

   5   and then having a stipulation as opposed to asking this

   6   witness based on no facts to speculate what he thought where

   7   the weapons were going, when there is contrary evidence based

   8   on statements made to him by other al Qaeda members that it

   9   was going to Yemen to fight the Yemeni Communists.

  10            So I would ask his answer to be stricken concerning

  11   his speculation.

  12            THE COURT:  We go up the hill and down the hill.

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  They shouldn't have gone up the hill in

  14   the first place.  That is opposite of what he has been told is

  15   sheer speculation.  That should not have been elicited.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, my understanding, and

  17   perhaps it wasn't clear, is that that shipment of weapons and

  18   explosives was going to Yemen to be used against the

  19   Communists, but part was being broken off to go to Saudi

  20   Arabia to be used against particular persons in the American

  21   military.  That was his understanding.  It was elicited as

  22   impeachment material because this witness participated in

  23   conduct against the American military.  He then pled guilty to

  24   a charge of that, and we brought out that in fact the

  25   explosives were not used for that purpose.  There were two



                                                                344



   1   different destinations for weapons and explosives.  We brought

   2   both out.  We impeached the witness to make clear that he

   3   engaged in criminal conduct and clarified that in fact the

   4   weapons were not used against the American military.  Just as

   5   when Mr. Schmidt objected to the basis of the hearsay for the

   6   informant, I was careful not to elicit what we agreed to bring

   7   out.

   8            THE COURT:  Let's review this again when we see the

   9   transcript of what was said, because it certainly was not very

  10   clear.

  11            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  12            THE COURT:  Reserve your objection, remind me, and as

  13   soon as we get the transcript we can see if anything needs to

  14   be clarified.  I don't think there is any real disagreement as

  15   to the substance, but we will see.

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  One other thing, your Honor.  I renew

  17   our application in limine concerning the hearsay from alleged

  18   coconspirators based on the lack of a definitive source.  For

  19   example, all testimony related to the committee in England is

  20   based on something said by this person Nalfi, but we don't

  21   know where his source of information is from.  We made that

  22   application obviously in greater detail yesterday, but it

  23   appears that the government is continuing to elicit

  24   information based not only on hearsay from an alleged al Qaeda

  25   declarant but where that declarant's source of information is



                                                                345



   1   not clear.  That is my objection.  I renew that objection.

   2            THE COURT:  It is overruled.  I think that there was

   3   a question as to what the source was of this witness's

   4   knowledge.  He was required to state it, and he responded.

   5            In five minutes I would like to see counsel for El

   6   Hage and the government, and the purpose of that is for me to

   7   be a little more focused on matters that we are going to deal

   8   with on Thursday.  Otherwise we are adjourned until 10:00 a.m.

  10   separate cover)
