<p>THE WHITE HOUSE
<br>Office of the Press Secretary
<br>Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts)

<p>Dear Mr. Speaker:  

<p>On January 23, 1995, in light of the threat posed by grave acts of

violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East

peace process, using my authority under, inter alia, the International

Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), I declared a

national emergency and issued Executive Order 12947. Because such

terrorist activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary

threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the

United States, I have renewed the national emergency declared in

Executive Order 12947 annually, most recently on January 21, 1998.

Pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic

Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and section 201 of the National

Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), I hereby report to the Congress that

I have exercised my statutory authority to issue an Executive Order

that amends Executive Order 12947 in order more effectively to respond

to the worldwide threat posed by foreign terrorists.


<p>The amendment to the Annex of Executive Order 12947 adds Usama bin

Muhammad bin Awad bin Ladin (a.k.a. Usama bin Ladin), Islamic Army,

Abu Hafs al-Masri, and Rifa'i Ahmad Taha Musa to the list of

terrorists that are subject to the prohibitions contained in the

Executive Order. These prohibitions include the blocking of all

property and interests in the property of the terrorists listed in the

Annex, the prohibition of any transaction or dealing by United States

persons or within the United States in property or interests in

property of the persons designated, and the prohibition of any

transaction by any United States persons or within the United States

that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, any

of the prohibitions set forth in the Executive Order.



<p>Usama bin Ladin and his organizations and associates have repeatedly

called upon their supporters to perform acts of violence. Bin Ladin

has declared that killing Americans and their allies "is an individual

duty for every Muslim ... in order to liberate the Al-Aqsa Mosque and

the Holy Mosque." These threats are clearly intended to violently

disrupt the Middle East peace process.


<p>This Executive Order does not limit or otherwise affect the other

provisions of Executive Order 12947.



<p>I have authorized these actions in view of the danger posed to the

national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States by

the activities of Usama bin Muhammad bin Awad bin Ladin (a.k.a. Usama

bin Ladin), Islamic Army, Abu Hafs al-Masri, and Rifa'i Ahmad Taha

Musa that disrupt the Middle East peace process. I am enclosing a copy

of the Executive Order that I have issued exercising my emergency

authorities.





<p><center>Sincerely,

WILLIAM J.  CLINTON</center>
