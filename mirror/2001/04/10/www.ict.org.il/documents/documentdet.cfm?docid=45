   1            (Trial resumes; jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  Let me make some logistic announcements.

   3            I have signed this morning, and they are presently

   4   being filed under seal, two opinions which I believe dispose

   5   of all motions presently fully submitted before the Court.

   6   The opinions include the Court's reasoning on its previously

   7   announced decision to permit the admission of the statements

   8   made in Kenya and South Africa, except for the statements made

   9   by Mr. al-'Owhali prior to his receipt of oral Miranda rights.

  10            Also included in those opinions are the Court's

  11   reasoning with respect to issues relating to presentment, the

  12   identification parade, and other miscellaneous matters.  They

  13   are in two separate opinions, and a classified appendix filed

  14   under seal.  The two opinions will be unsealed on the 16th and

  15   counsel are to advise the Court in writing prior to that time

  16   whether any redactions are appropriate prior to that being

  17   unsealed.

  18            The classified appendix, which deals with matters

  19   relating to the transportation of the defendant Odeh from

  20   Pakistan to Kenya, will remain classified and sealed until

  21   such time as the government advises that that classification

  22   is no longer required.

  23            We learned over the weekend that Mr. Schmidt, who had

  24   prepared the cross-examination of al-Fadl, has the flu, and

  25   although he has all confidence in Mr. Dratel, since he had



                                                                414



   1   prepared that cross-examination, he asked that it be deferred.

   2   And so what we will do this morning is we'll have the

   3   cross-examination by the counsel for the three other

   4   defendants, whereupon we will adjourn for today.

   5            Tomorrow if Mr. Schmidt is not recovered sufficiently

   6   to cross-examine, we will proceed with the next government

   7   witness, with the understanding that al-Fadl will be recalled

   8   for purposes of further cross-examination and redirect.

   9            In what sequence will the defendants cross-examine

  10   the witness?

  11            MR. HERMAN:  Mr. Odeh will go first, your Honor.

  12            MR. BAUGH:  Mr. al-'Owhali will go second, your

  13   Honor.

  14            MR. RUHNKE:  We'll finish, your Honor.

  15            THE COURT:  And am I correct that we will complete

  16   before the lunch break?

  17            MR. COHN:  Certainly if the government is deferring

  18   any of its redirect until after cross-examination.

  19            THE COURT:  There's no point in having redirect until

  20   after all cross-examinations.

  21            MR. COHN:  Then the answer is yes.

  22            THE COURT:  That's a very important logistical

  23   question because we haven't ordered lunch for the jurors.

  24   That's a matter of great concern.

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  I had about ten minutes more with



                                                                415



   1   the witness to start.

   2            THE COURT:  Ten minutes more of direct?

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Direct.

   4            THE COURT:  Of direct of the witness.  Very well.

   5            Mr. Dratel, do you want me to tell the jury that

   6   Mr. Schmidt is ill, or should I not say anything?  Maybe not

   7   saying anything would be best.

   8            MR. DRATEL:  I think the Court should say that the

   9   cross-examination of Mr. al-Fadl by Mr. El Hage is being

  10   deferred because of Mr. Schmidt's illness, so they don't think

  11   that he will not cross-examine, it's coming.

  12            THE COURT:  I don't think they have any sense what

  13   the normal sequence would be.  We had a sense as to what the

  14   sequence will be, but I don't think they will.

  15            MR. DRATEL:  Maybe if you proceed with other

  16   witnesses tomorrow, if we don't go forward tomorrow, maybe

  17   that would be appropriate.

  18            THE COURT:  That would be the time, all right.

  19            I certainly encourage the defense teams to arrange so

  20   that there is not this huge array of defense counsel sitting

  21   here.  That's a decision that defense counsel have made for

  22   themselves, but it is not -- I just want to be clear that it

  23   isn't a requirement of the Court that there be three counsel

  24   present for each defendant at all times.

  25            We're now just awaiting the defendants, then we'll



                                                                416



   1   bring in the jury, then we'll have ten minutes or more of

   2   redirect and then we'll proceed with the cross-examination by

   3   Odeh, Al-'Owhali, and K.K. Mohamed, in that sequence, and then

   4   we'll adjourn.

   5            Is there anything else anybody wants to take up?

   6   Very well.

   7            (Brief recess)

   8            (Jury present)

   9            THE COURT:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

  10            THE JURY:  Good morning.

  11            THE COURT:  I hope everyone had a pleasant weekend,

  12   and we will resume with the continued direct examination by

  13   the government of the government's first witness, al-Fadl, and

  14   he may take the stand.

  15            And I understand we have a new interpreter.

  16   Mr. Kenneally, will you swear the interpreter.

  17            (Interpreter sworn)

  18            DEPUTY CLERK:  Please state your full name.

  19            THE INTERPRETER:  My name is Seham Susan Laraby,

  20   L-A-R-A-B-Y.

  21            DEPUTY CLERK:  Thank you.

  22    JAMAL AHMED MOHAMED AL-FADL, Resumes

  23            THE COURT:  Mr. al-Fadl, the Court advises you that

  24   you are still under oath.

  25            THE WITNESS:  Okay.



                                                                417



   1            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you, Judge.

   1   easy.  What did he say beyond that?

   2   A.  He said it is not easy to start because different tribe,

   3   different groups, there's nobody control going on over there,

   4   but we try to start a little bit and if go good, we go bigger.

   5   Q.  Now, prior to coming to court today did you listen to a

   6   tape recording with a CD?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I'll just refer to

   9   Government Exhibit 200A for identification purposes only at

  10   this time.

  11   Q.  In listening to that recording, I just have a couple of

  12   brief questions.

  19   Q.  And the men who came were encouraged to study and to pray;

  20   is that right?

  21   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  22   Q.  The young men who came to Afghanistan were encouraged,

  23   were taught to study Koran and to pray?

   1   Q.  Okay.  In fact, it really wasn't until 1991 when the

   2   headquarters was moved to Sudan that there began to be

   3   discussions about the United States being the enemy?

   4   A.  It's before we move to Sudan the people start talking

   6   the Sudan, you were pretty familiar with the political

   7   situation, is that fair to say?

   8   A.  Yes.

  25   documents; is that right?



                                                                440



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  So this was a specialty within the organization of al

   3   Qaeda; is that correct?

   4   A.  Yes, but it is changed when we went to Sudan.

   5   Q.  All right.  I'm now talking about before you got to Sudan.

   6   A.  Okay.

   7   Q.  You yourself would travel to many places for al Qaeda; is

   8   that right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And you used different names or aliases?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And I think you mentioned that maybe even nine or ten

  13   different names; is that right?

  14   A.  Yeah.

  15   Q.  In fact, even Usama Bin Laden was able to travel under a

  16   false name; is that right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Even though he was a fairly well-known person at that

  19   time?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21            THE COURT:  Is there an answer?

  22            THE WITNESS:  I say yes.

  23   Q.  And the people who were preparing the false passports

  24   would try to match the description of the person with the

  25   false passport, is that your understanding?



                                                                441



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And sometimes they would take a photograph of the person

   3   who wished to travel and put it into the passport?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Sometimes they would actually create an entirely new false

   6   passport?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Sometimes they would use an existing passport from one

   9   country to have a person travel to a different country?

  10   A.  I don't know what "existing."

  11   Q.  I'll withdraw it.

  12            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And I gather now when you got to Sudan -- and I'm talking

  15   now after 1991 -- you were even able to obtain passports from

  16   the Sudanese government; is that correct?

  17   A.  Yes, we got a couple hundred.

  18   Q.  Okay, for your members of al Qaeda so they could travel

  19   outside the Sudan; is that right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And these were again false passports; is that right?

  22   A.  No.

  23   Q.  All right, they were real passports?

  24   A.  Yes, real passport.

  25   Q.  For real people?



                                                                442



   1   A.  Yes, and making Sudanese citizenships.

   2   Q.  And giving them Sudanese citizenship?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Were these people, were all these people actually citizens

   5   of Sudan?

   6   A.  No.

   7   Q.  And also, al Qaeda developed ways of hiding the fact that

   8   their members were traveling, is that true?

   9   A.  I don't understand that.

  10   Q.  When al Qaeda members would travel and they did not want

  11   to be shown to be a member of al Qaeda or even a Muslim, they

  12   would -- they might shave their beard?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  They might take magazines which a Muslim would not

  15   ordinarily read?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  Is that correct?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  They might carry, as you mentioned, cigarettes, even

  20   though it was prohibited to smoke?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  As a means of escaping detection when they went through

  23   Customs; is that right?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And another technique that was taught to the members of al



                                                                443



   1   Qaeda, especially in Pakistan, was to use bribes?

   2   A.  I don't understand that.

   3            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   4   A.  Yes, sometimes we use that.

   5   Q.  Another feature of the al Qaeda organization or another

   6   aspect of the organization was that not everybody in the

   7   organization always knew everything that the organization was

   8   doing, is that true?

   9   A.  Not exactly.

  10   Q.  People in the organization had various specialties; is

  11   that right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And if someone didn't have a specialty and was not

  14   involved, let's say, in a mission, a particular project, that

  15   person wouldn't necessarily know about what the mission was;

  16   is that correct?

  17   A.  Not exactly.

  18   Q.  You were the third person to join al Qaeda; is that right?

  19   A.  Sign, at that time.

  20   Q.  To sign the contract with al Qaeda; is that right?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And you were in a high position in al Qaeda; is that

  23   correct?

  24   A.  The shura council up to me, so I'm under them.

  25   Q.  You were under the shura council?



                                                                444



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And al Qaeda trusted you with large amounts of money?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  There were times when you would be carrying $50,000 in

   5   American dollars in cash; is that right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Or even more?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And you also were involved when al Qaeda went to the Sudan

  10   of purchasing property in the Sudan; is that correct?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And that was over $200,000; is that right?

  13   A.  250, yes.

  14   Q.  $250,000?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  So you were in a position of trust with regard to al

  17   Qaeda; is that right?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And you were in a position of responsibility?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And you knew many of the areas that al Qaeda was involved

  22   with; is that right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  But in 1991 how many members did al Qaeda have?

  25   A.  I don't know exactly the number, but could be thousand,



                                                                445



   1   could be less.  I don't know exactly the number.

   2   Q.  Okay, approximately?

   3   A.  Could be around 2,000 or a little less.

   4   Q.  Around 2,000 people?

   5   A.  Or less.

   6   Q.  Did you know every member of al Qaeda?

   7   A.  No.

   8   Q.  And did you ever describe the structure of al Qaeda like a

   9   pyramid?

  10   A.  Could she help me?

  11            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  12   A.  Sometimes, yes.

  13   Q.  Okay.  In fact, after you began talking to the American

  14   authorities, you spent a lot of time with them telling them

  15   about yourself and about al Qaeda; is that right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And you met with them on many occasions?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And they asked you -- withdrawn.  And it was over a period

  20   of over five years?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And they would ask you questions about who was in al

  25   Qaeda; is that right?



                                                                446



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Who was in the shura council?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  What you did?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  What other people did, right?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And similar types of questions to what I asked you today

   9   about businesses, finance, banks, money, that type of thing?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Right?  And when they were talking to you they were taking

  12   down notes or they were doing reports; is that right?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Did you ever read all of the reports that were prepared

  15   about you?

  16   A.  Not all of it, maybe.

  17   Q.  It's pretty, pretty large number of reports, right?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  What it seems that you told American officials, at least

  20   on one occasion, is that the security and the Jihad activities

  21   which were adopted by the Islamic movements are built in a

  22   pyramidal -- a shape of a pyramid?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Do you remember saying something like that?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                447



   1   Q.  And then you said, "So if one level of activity is

   2   discovered, the discovery is contained to that level in the

   3   organization."  Now those -- you may not have said those

   4   words, but was that the idea that you were telling them?

   5   A.  I don't understand.

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  So if we think of al Qaeda as a pyramid, the people at the

   9   top knew everything that was happening in the organization; is

  10   that right?

  11   A.  Correct.

  12   Q.  But there were lines along the pyramid, right?

  13   A.  Yes, and the new people.

  14   Q.  The new people?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  The new people would not necessarily be told everything;

  17   is that right?

  18   A.  Sometime if they involved with something, they know.

  19   Sometimes no.

  20   Q.  But Mr. Al-Fadl, if they were not involved, if they had no

  21   role in a particular mission, there would be no need to tell

  22   them?

  23   A.  I don't know what you mean about "mission."

  24   Q.  Okay.  If al Qaeda was involved in a particular activity

  25   and a person at the bottom of the pyramid had no participation



                                                                448



   1   in that activity, that person would not have to know about the

   2   activity; is that correct?

   3   A.  Official, yes, but if the people talk in a guesthouse,

   4   maybe he know.

   5   Q.  But as far as the organization was concerned, for security

   6   purposes some activities that al Qaeda engaged in were not

   7   told to everybody on the pyramid?

   8   A.  You're right, that's correct, but sometimes they talk.

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, a juror --

  10            A JUROR:  I need to use the bathroom.

  11            THE COURT:  Yes, all right.  We'll take a brief

   1            (In open court; jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  All right, let's resume.  The jurors have

   9            (Witness resumed)

  10            THE COURT:  Mr. Herman, you may continue.

  11            MR. HERMAN:  Thank you, your Honor.

  12   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, before we took the break I was asking you

  13   questions about whether all members of the al Qaeda knew about

  14   all activities of al Qaeda?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  That's the subject we're talking about.  And I'm going to

  17   use an example that you gave us last week about when you were

  18   told that you were going to have to move to Kenya, remember?

  19   A.  Yes.

   1   Q.  And you were earning money from al Qaeda, is that right?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And you had grown up in the Sudan, right?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And you are told that you're going to have to move to

   6   Kenya?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And you're not told what you're supposed to do, right?

  11   A.  No, I, they told me.

  12   Q.  You weren't told why you were going to Kenya, were you?

  13   A.  No, they give me something I have to take it over there.

  14   Q.  You have to take an envelope to Kenya, right?

  15   A.  With documents, yes.

  16   Q.  With documents.  You thought you were moving to Kenya,

  17   didn't you?

  18   A.  Yeah, he tell me that, yes, right.

  19   Q.  You were ready to move from Sudan with your wife to Kenya,

  20   right?

  21   A.  Correct.

  22   Q.  And that's what they told you?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  When you get to Kenya you're at the airport, right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                451



   1   Q.  And then they take you to another location?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And you deliver the documents?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And then they said to you:  You're not moving to Kenya any

   6   more, right?

   7   A.  Right.

   8   Q.  You're moving to Pakistan?

   9   A.  That's right.

  10   Q.  And that was the first that you knew that you were weren't

  11   going to be living in Kenya, right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And you and your wife then flew to Pakistan, right?

  14   A.  Correct.

  15   Q.  And she stayed there for a number of months, right?

  16   A.  Correct.

  17   Q.  And you came back to the Sudan, right?

  18   A.  Correct.

  19   Q.  And then did she join you in the Sudan?

  20   A.  Later, yes.

  21   Q.  Later on?

  22   A.  Yeah.

  23   Q.  So this was an example of a mission where you didn't even

  24   know, and you were involved, but you didn't even know that you

  25   weren't going to stay in Kenya, right?



                                                                452

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And did he write any books?

  11   A.  I don't remember his books, but he got notes about his

  12   time during the present, Surre.

  17   A.  Correct.

  18   Q.  A-L-T-A  R-I-B-A-A-L  S-O-O-R-I-Y-A-H.  Was that a book

  19   that he wrote?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  Okay.  And do you know the name Dr. F-A-D-E-L?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And did he write a book called Al jama fat al elm?  I'll

   1   Q.  I'll try, did you know, now Dr. Fadl, did you know him to

   2   write any books?

   3   A.  I remember, yes, he write a couple books.

   4   Q.  Was there a book that they called Al Jame?

   5   A.  Jame?  I don't remember.

   6   Q.  A book about a collection or composition seeking the

   7   truth?  Does that ring a bell?

   8   A.  I don't remember, but could be, yes.

   9   Q.  Okay.  Now, do you know the name last name Asmari?

  12   A.  No.

  13   Q.  I may be mispronouncing it?

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  One moment, your Honor.

  15            (Pause)

  16   Q.  I am mispronouncing it.  I apologize.  Okay.  I should

  17   have said Azmarai.

  21   Q.  Was he on the Shura Council?

  22   A.  I don't remember that.

  23   Q.  Okay.  When you were talking to the American officials

  24   they asked you about who was on the Shura Council, you

  25   remember that?



                                                                454



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Okay.  And you told them that there were thirty-one

   3   members?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Okay.  And I have it here that number 23 is Azmarai Alsui.

   6   Does that refresh your recollection?

   7   A.  If I told them, yeah, yes.

   8   Q.  But I don't remember now.

   9   Q.  Part of -- withdrawn.  Al Qaeda had many means of

  10   communication amongst its members, is that correct?

  11   A.  Committee, yes.

  12   Q.  Let me -- all right.  What I'm talking about are

  13   telephones, radios?

  14   A.  Oh, okay, yes.

  15            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  I see you're consulting with the interpreter.  Do you

  18   understand my question?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  They had radios, telephones?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Correct?  They had cell phones?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Apparently Usama Bin Laden had a satellite phone?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                455



   1   Q.  A very expensive phone from Germany?

   2   A.  Yeah, I remember he buy some equipment from Germany.

   3   Q.  And I think you told the agents that the phone might have

   4   cost $80,000?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And that at some point when they were in the Sudan they

   7   had radios that were, had belonged to the Sudanese Army, is

   8   that correct?

   9   A.  It's a group radio, but we buy it through the Army.

  10   Q.  Okay.  And then you had hand-held radios as well, is that

  11   right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  So al Qaeda had, at least when they got to the Sudan,

  14   pretty sophisticated means of speaking with each other.  Is

  15   that fair to say?

  16   A.  Yes, officers, yes.

  17   Q.  Now, you told us last week, Mr. Al Fadl, that at some

  18   point you were ordered to kill the former president of the

  19   Sudan; is that right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And that was Sadiq al-Mahdi?

  22   A.  Al-Mahdi, yes.

  23   Q.  S-A-D-I-Q  AL-M-A-H-D-I?

  24   A.  Correct.

  25   Q.  This was the person who had been the Prime Minister of the



                                                                456



   1   Sudan until 1989, right?

   2   A.  Correct.

   3   Q.  And you received an order that he should be killed by, on

   4   behalf of al Qaeda, is that right?

   5   A.  National front.

   6   Q.  And was there any doubt in your mind that you were

   7   supposed to kill him?

   8   A.  Well, they asked me but I didn't do it.

   9   Q.  Okay.  You didn't do it because you determined that there

  10   was no religious basis to do it, right?

  11   A.  It's not easy that time.

  12   Q.  What?

  13   A.  It's not easy.

  14   Q.  It wasn't easy to kill him, right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  You were supposed to poison him, right?

  17   A.  No, they asked me and I tell them it's going to be hard.

  18   Q.  Well, they did more than ask you, didn't they, Mr. Al

  19   Fadl?

  20   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  21   Q.  It was more than they just asked you.  Did you want to do

  22   it, right?

  23   A.  Yeah, it's order, but --

  24   Q.  Or, right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                457



   1   Q.  Fatwa?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  But you didn't do it, did you?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  And you also told the agents that there had been

   6   discussions in 1994 some officers in Bin Laden's Islamic Army

   7   presented a proposal to blow up the American embassy in

   8   Riyadh.  Remember that?

   9   A.  Yeah, we have some talk about that.

  10   Q.  And the Saudi component of the Islamic Army rejected the

  11   proposal, right?

  12   A.  I don't understand what you said.

  13   Q.  Okay.  There was a discussion back in 1994, of blowing up

  14   an American embassy, right?

  15   A.  In Riyadh City.

  16   Q.  In Riyadh City?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And it was discussed by individuals in al Qaeda, right?

  19   A.  Abu Hahs Al-Masri.

  20   Q.  But the idea of blowing up an American embassy was, it was

  21   decided that that would not be done, correct?


  22   A.  I don't know why, but what I gain from the meeting they

  23   tried to do that.

  24   Q.  Well, they didn't tell you why, right?

  25   A.  I don't know why.



                                                                458



   1   Q.  You don't know why?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  But they didn't do it?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  Now, you told the agents when they asked you about Usama

   6   Bin Laden, you told the agents that Usama Bin Laden

   7   misinterprets certain portions of the Koran to justify violent

   8   action.  Do you remember saying that?

   9   A.  I don't understand what you say.

  10            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  11   A.  No, not exactly like what you say.

  12   Q.  You spoke to the agents a lot, didn't you?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And you remember everything that you said?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And they were taking down notes at the time?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And is it your position today that you never told the

  19   agents that Usama Bin Laden misinterpreted certain portions of

  20   the Koran to justify violent actions?

  21   A.  Well, when we talk about which scholar we follow in al

  22   Qaeda because there are so many scholars.  Some people they

  23   follow scholar, he talk about something.  Some people they say

  24   no, no this scholar, but we follow another scholar.

  25   Q.  Here's my question, and if you don't understand it I'll



                                                                459



   1   either rephrase it or ask the interpreter.

   2   A.  Okay.

   3   Q.  Did you tell American agents that Bin Laden misinterprets

   4   certain portions of the Koran to justify violent action?

   5   A.  I really, I don't remember exactly like this.

   6   Q.  Does it sound like something that you said?

   7   A.  It's similar like when we talk about who's scholar in our

   8   group.

   9   Q.  Do you understand my question?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Did you say that?

  12   A.  If they wrote it, yes.

  13            MR. HERMAN:  That's all I have, Judge.  Thank you.

  16   Q.  To what country do you have that loyalty.

  17            Ms. Laraby, could you translate?

  18            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  19   A.  I'm from Sudan.

  20   Q.  So you took this oath to help Sudan?

  21   A.  No, al Qaeda.

  22   Q.  Did you take it to help Islam or to help Sudan?

  23   A.  When I was in al Qaeda, Islam.

  24   Q.  Islam.  Now, in 1996 after you had taken your bayat you

  25   were told that al Qaeda was contemplating or thinking about



                                                                464

   2   A.  What year?

   3   Q.  In 1996, before you left the organization?

   4   A.  Yes.  What do you say?

   5            MR. BAUGH:  Ms. Laraby could you translate, please?

   6   Q.  Before you left in 1996 were you told that al Qaeda was

   7   thinking about blowing up embassies?

   8            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   9   A.  I think in '94 I heard that.

  10   Q.  And you also were told is -- that you in fact, you

  11   participated in trying to buy uranium to make a bomb?

  12   A.  Yes, in '94.

  13   Q.  In '94.  Now, al Qaeda, am I correct, told you why this

  14   had to be done, didn't they?

  15   A.  Which be done?

  16   Q.  Well, for instance, did al Qaeda tell you that the United

  17   States was killing Iraqis with their sanction?

  18   A.  Yes, that, they got different fatwa.

  19   Q.  I'm sorry?

  20   A.  They got different fatwa.

  21   Q.  Yes.  No, no.  The question is this.  Did anyone in al

  22   Qaeda tell you that Americans had killed over a million Iraqis

  23   with their sanction?

  24   A.  Yes, they talk about that.

  25   Q.  And you know that to be true, don't you?



                                                                465



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  All right.  Did al Qaeda tell you that one of the reasons

   3   that America was wrong was because America allowed Saddam

   4   Hussein to remain in control of Iraq?

   5   A.  I don't understand that.

   6   Q.  Well, is Saddam Hussein liked or disliked by al Qaeda?

   7   A.  They don't think he's real government Muslim.

   8   Q.  Do they like him or dislike him?

   9   A.  It's hard to say yes or no.

  10   Q.  All right.  Did al Qaeda tell you that one of the reasons

  11   America was wrong was because of its treatment of the Kurds?

  12   A.  What mean Kurds?

  13            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  14   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  15   Q.  Of course.  Could I --

  16            Ms. Laraby.  Did al Qaeda tell you that one of the

  17   reasons America was bad was because of its treatment of the

  18   Kurds?

  19            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  20   A.  I don't remember.

  21   Q.  Well, did you ever hear that America had promised the

  22   Kurds certain thing after the Gulf War?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And that one of the things America promised the Kurds if

  25   they rose up and overthrow Saddam Hussein, we'd help them, the



                                                                466



   1   Americans would help them?  Did you hear that before.

   2            Ms. Laraby.

   3            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   4            THE COURT:  Mr. Baugh.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, sir.

   6            THE COURT:  Use the microphone, sir.

   7            MR. BAUGH:  Yes, sir.

   8   A.  I don't remember that.

   9   Q.  Well, then you don't remember whether you were told that,

  10   or you don't remember if that is true?

  11   A.  I don't remember is that true or not true.

  12   Q.  All right.  Were you told that America was wrong

  13   because --

  14            THE COURT:  Can you be a little more specific as to

  15   who was doing the telling here?

  16            MR. BAUGH:  Okay, forgive me.  Yes, sir.

  17            As part of your involvement in al Qaeda would you as

  18   a group get together and have meetings and talk about things?

  19   A.  A lot.

  20   Q.  And during these meetings would members of this group talk

  21   about why your acts had to be done?

  22   A.  What mean acts?  

  23            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And the people in this conversation would be members of al



                                                                467



   1   Qaeda?

   2   A.  They have to.

   3   Q.  They have to be in order to be.  And sometimes it would be

   4   Mr. Bin Laden, and sometimes other people whose names we have

   5   spelled all day?

   6   A.  Yes, you're right.

   7   Q.  And some of these people would talk about the death of a

   8   million Iraqis?

   9   A.  Yes, you're right.

  10   Q.  And that over one half million of those people who have

  11   been killed since 1991 are children under the age of 5?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And that America sends troops to the Arab countries but

  14   they don't pull them out?

  15   A.  Right.

  16   Q.  In fact, there are still troops in Saudi Arabia?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And that when troops went in, in Somalia there was a

  19   concern the troops would stay there?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And colonize Somalia?

  22   A.  What mean colonize?

  23            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  24   A.  Occupation, maybe.

  25   Q.  What?



                                                                468

   3            Sir, I want to tell you if I use the incorrect term,

   4   you feel free to correct me, okay?

   5   A.  Okay.

   6   Q.  Thank you.

   7            In these discussions would they talk about how

   8   America was controlling certain Arab governments?

   9   A.  You're right.

  10   Q.  Now, these are things that Bin Laden and other people told

  11   you?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And you know that all of those things are true, don't you?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Did they tell you in these meetings that you couldn't

  16   trust America because they always break their treaties?

  17            Translation, please.

  18            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  19   A.  They say that, yes.

  20   Q.  All right.  And did they tell you that historically

  21   westerners always break their treaties with Arab countries?

  22            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  23   A.  Yes, they say that.

  24   Q.  Did they talk about the great betrayal of 1916?

  25            (Witness consults with interpreter)



                                                                469

  11   Madeline Albright stating that she knew the United States had

  12   killed a half million children in Iraq?

  13   A.  No.

  14   Q.  Now, during the time appeared, we're talking about 1991 to

  15   1996, America was continuing to bomb Iraq, weren't they?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And you as a Muslim never knew what day America was going

  18   to bomb Iraqis and kill them, am I correct?

  19   A.  Could you repeat?

  20   Q.  You never knew what days America was going to kill

  21   Americans -- strike that.

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.  Relevance grounds.

  23            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  24            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you.

  25   Q.  You never knew when the Americans were going to bomb



                                                                470



   1   Iraqis and kill them, did you?

   2   A.  I don't know.

   3   Q.  Okay.  It could have been the next day and you wouldn't

   4   have known it?

   5   A.  I don't know.

   6   Q.  All right.  And was one of the reasons for al Qaeda hating

   7   Americans to stop that bombing?

   8   A.  Yes, they talk about that.

   9   Q.  And was it reasonable to you --

  10            Translation, please.

  11   A.  I understand reasonable.

  12   Q.  Oh, forgive me.  Was it reasonable for you to believe

  13   that?

  14   A.  It was substantiated.

  15   Q.  I'm sorry.  I could not understand you?

  16   A.  I understand what you say, but with some explaining.

  17   Q.  Explain please, go ahead.

  18   A.  Because some Muslims they see American troops, they don't

  19   go in the Gulf area by themselves.  The government --

  20   Q.  Slow down just a little bit, just a little bit.  Could you

  21   start over again?

  22   A.  Some people in other group they say the American troops

  23   they don't go to Gulf area by themself.  The Saudi government,

  24   the Kuwait government, they bring them to Gulf area to stop

  25   Iraq because Iraqi tried to take all the Arab countries.



                                                                471



   1   Q.  All right.  And was it reasonable for you to believe that

   2   the only way to stop the Americans from killing Iraqis was to

   3   get them out of Saudi Arabia?

   4   A.  Well, the al Qaeda people they talk about that.

   5   Q.  Al Qaeda did.  No, no.  Did you believe that?

   6   A.  No.

   7   Q.  You didn't believe that?

   8   A.  It was explained, you know, it's hard for group, you know,

   9   but those Americans they have agreement with Saudi government

  10   and Kuwait and Gulf countries.

  11   Q.  But am I correct, sir, that it was your position

  12   personally and al Qaeda's position that if enough Americans

  13   were killed they would stop bombing Iraq?

  14   A.  Well, al Qaeda believe, yes, they believe that.

  15            MR. BAUGH:  If he stands up you have to be quiet,

  16   okay.  That's one of the rules.

  17   A.  The al Qaeda people, yeah, they believed that.

  18   Q.  Now, would you agree -- well, first, there's a difference

  19   between Arabs and Muslims, right?

  20   A.  Right.

  21   Q.  All Arabs are not Muslims?

  22   A.  You're right.

  23   Q.  And all Muslims are not Arabs?

  24   A.  We got Arab Jews, we got Arab Christian.  We have Arab --

  25   Q.  You have Philippino Muslims and Pakistan Muslims?



                                                                472



   1   A.  You're right.

   2   Q.  Now, am I correct that to understand al Qaeda you must

   3   understand Islam?

   4   A.  They teach you about Islam.

   5   Q.  And you've lived in the United States, haven't you?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And based on your experience Americans don't know a lot

   8   about Islam, do they?

   9   A.  It's hard to say that because a lot, some Americans they

  10   know very much Islam.

  11   Q.  Well, and believe me I mean no disrespect to -- you are

  12   Muslim, right?

  13   A.  Yeah, but it's thousand of mosque in United States.

  14   Q.  I understand.  And I'm going to ask you for some

  15   explanations about Islam as you understand them, all right?

  16   A.  Okay.

  17   Q.  And do you understand that when I ask you these questions

  18   I don't mean to offend you, because I'm a Baptist from

  19   Virginia, and this is all knew to me.

  20   A.  All right.  You know I be honest with you and I try my

  21   best to give you honest answer.

  22   Q.  But am I correct that Islam is very important to

  23   understanding al Qaeda?

  24   A.  If you be member, yes, you have to be know about Islam,

  25   but you focus on jihad.



                                                                473



   1   Q.  We're going to talk about jihad in just a moment.

   2   A.  They going to teach you about jihad there.

   3   Q.  What's the last word?

   4   A.  They going to teach you, they focus on jihad.

   5   Q.  Now, first a couple of things about Islam that I just

   6   learned.  In Islam yo'all believe in Adam and Eve, don't you?

   7   A.  Adam?

   8   Q.  Adam and Eve, the first man?

   9            (Witness consults with interpreter)?

  10   A.  The first prophet, yes.

  11   Q.  And you believe that there are prophets who speak, who

  12   have been spoken to by God, Allah?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And when you say Allah, you say praise be unto his name

  15   Allah?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And if I don't say that, you won't be offended, will you?

  18   A.  I don't understand what you --

  19   Q.  Okay.  If I don't say Allah, praise be unto his name, is

  20   that disrespect on my part?

  21            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  22   A.  No.

  23   Q.  Okay.  And you understand I'm not asking you to be a

  24   religious expert.  I just want to know your views or your

  25   understanding, all right?



                                                                474



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Okay.  Now, you took instruction in Islam, am I correct?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And you were taught that there were a hundred twenty some

   5   thousand prophets before Mohammed?

   6   A.  We have in all the Koran twenty-five.

   7   Q.  Well, there are?

   8   A.  Twenty-five only in Holy Koran.

   9   Q.  Mentioned?

  10   A.  Our book, yes.  But other we don't know the names.

  11   Q.  And some of those profits include Moses?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Abraham?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Jesus?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  Noah?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And as to Jesus you believe that Jesus was crucified?

  20   A.  What is that?

  21            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  22   A.  No, we don't believe that.

  23   Q.  Well, you believe he was -- strike that.

  24            You believe that he did not die on the cross?

  25   A.  We believe when the Jews tried to kill him in Jerusalem



                                                                475



   1   that God take him up.

   2   Q.  That God took him to Paradise?

   3   A.  He bring somebody look like Jesus and the Jews kill the

   4   wrong person.

   5   Q.  And you believe in the virgin birth of Jesus?

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7   A.  Yes, is special gift from God to the world.

   8   Q.  Now, and also in Islam suicide is forbidden, it is your

   9   understanding?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Okay.  Because the human body belongs to God?

  12   A.  Yes, but some scholar they say they make fatwa, it's okay.

  13   Q.  If they make fatwa.  But if they make fatwa it's not

  14   suicide any more, it's now martyrdom?

  15   A.  If they make fatwa that means it's okay.

  16   Q.  Okay.  Now, and I'm going to be very brief and broad with

  17   this, but Islam is based on certain principles that its

  18   members are supposed to do?

  19   A.  Five.

  20   Q.  Five.  The same number of points on the star, right, the

  21   Five Pillars of Islam?

  22   A.  Yes, you have to.

  23   Q.  We'll go over those.  The first one is must bear witness,

  24   all right?

  25            (Witness consults with interpreter)



                                                                476



   1   Q.  Shahada?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  That means you must tell yourself that you are going to be

   4   Muslim?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And recognize Allah?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  The second one is prayer, am I correct?

   9            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  10   Q.  Shala?

  11   A.  Yes, you're right.

  12   Q.  And you are supposed to pray at least five times a day?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And those five times are determined by the position of the

  15   sun?

  16            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And those prayers are done normally as individuals?

  19   A.  With a group.

  20   Q.  Well, the only group prayer that is required is Friday

  21   afternoon, am I correct?

  22   A.  No, if you can, but the best join group.

  23   Q.  You normally you pray with your group?

  24   A.  No, if you can, you do your best to join people pray with

  25   people.



                                                                477



   1   Q.  You do your best to be with other people, but if you can't

   2   you pray by yourself?

   3   A.  Right.

   4   Q.  And to not pray five times a day, is the word sin, Shalam?

   5            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   6   A.  No, because some Muslim you don't, you don't have

   7   education about Islam, so you don't know how Shalam invoke.

   8   They need somebody invoke, but you can't say haram to them.

   9   Q.  But once they learn, once they are taught about Shala,

  10   prayer, then it is haram not to pray in accordance with the

  11   dictates of Allah?

  12   A.  If somebody scholar he tells them, and he gives them

  13   kalil, explanation about Shala and how invoke, yes, you right.

  14   Q.  And also, before I go to the rest of them, these

  15   principles were actually given to Mohammed by Allah, am I

  16   correct?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And Mohammed wrote them down on pieces of paper and pieces

  19   of bone so he could remember them?

  20   A.  Oh, Mohammed he can't write.  Somebody wrote it.

  21   Q.  Somebody wrote them for him?

  22   A.  Not him.

  23   Q.  And those writings are what make up the Koran?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Now, the third principle is Zaka?



                                                                478



   1   A.  Zaka.

   2   Q.  Which is giving to the poor?

   3   A.  Yes, it's similar like that.

   4   Q.  Like that?

   5   A.  Every year you take some of two or five percent for your

   6   money every year.

   7   Q.  And this is also given to Islam from Mohammed and from

   8   Allah?

   9   A.  Yes, for poor people, for jihad, for mosque, for like

  10   that.

  11   Q.  And failure to do that is a sin?

  12            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  The fourth one is the principle is fasting?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Which requires that during the ninth lunar month --

  17   believe me I learned this weekend -- the ninth lunar month all

  18   true Muslims do not eat or take in water during the daylight

  19   hours?

  20   A.  Yes, sunrise, before sunrise until sunset.

  21   Q.  And to, and if you know that it is wrong and you do eat

  22   during those hours, that is a sin?

  23   A.  Yeah, but if you look at you say you sick, you can't do

  24   it, that's different.

  25   Q.  That's right.  In Islam there are, if you're sick or if



                                                                479



   1   you're pregnant, then you don't have to fast?

   2   A.  Or if the woman nurse.

   3   Q.  If the woman is nursing.

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And the last principle is Hajj which is to visit Mecca

   6   once in your life?

   7   A.  You're right, if you have enough money.

   8   Q.  If you have the money.  And if you don't have enough

   9   money?

  10   A.  No problem.

  11   Q.  God forgives you?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And nowadays it's not that expensive, but there was a time

  14   when it could take months to take hajj?

  15   A.  Yeah, you right.

  16   Q.  Or even years?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  To walk to Mecca?

  19   A.  You're right.

  20   Q.  And another principal, if not one of the five though, is

  21   jihad?

  22   A.  You right.

  23   Q.  Now, these other five principles if someone knows of these

  24   principles and they refuse to obey them that is a sin, right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                480



   1   Q.  Now, with jihad am I correct that, and correct me if I'm

   2   wrong --

   3   A.  Okay.

   4   Q.  -- that under jihad, jihad is a duty of Muslims to protect

   5   other Muslims from invasion?

   6   A.  You're right.

   7   Q.  And if you as a practicing Muslim feel that an invader is

   8   invading a Muslim country, then you have a personal duty to

   9   aid them?

  10   A.  If I can answer your question if I --

  11   Q.  Sure.  You want it translated.

  12            Ms. Laraby, would you like me to repeat it?

  13            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  14   A.  You're right, you're right.

  15   Q.  And also very important distinction in Islam, unlike we

  16   Christians, you don't have priests and Popes or people who

  17   are -- do you understand?

  18            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  19   Q.  You have imams?

  20   A.  You're right.

  21   Q.  But imam, he's just someone who knows more about the

  22   religion than you?

  23   A.  Yeah, he's a scholar.

  24   Q.  He's a what?

  25   A.  A scholar.



                                                                481



   1   Q.  A scholar.

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  But he doesn't -- okay.  And the purpose, the most

   4   important part of a Muslim's life is to follow Islam, the word

   5   of God?

   6   A.  You're right.

   7   Q.  Not to follow a man or a priest but to follow Islam,

   8   right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Okay.  Now, if you believe, you as an individual, believe

  11   that a Muslim country is being invaded by a dictator are you

  12   supposed to engage in jihad?

  13   A.  Yes, if the scholar in that country, the --

  14   Q.  The scholar?

  15   A.  They all speak together and they make fatwa, the people

  16   listen to them.

  17   Q.  And if you believe that that fatwa is Islamically correct

  18   then you have a duty to engage in jihad?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And that duty is the same as your duty to pray?

  21   A.  You're right.

  22   Q.  And is the same as your duty to make hajj or make the trip

  23   to Mecca?

  24   A.  You're right.

  25   Q.  Are you familiar with Christianity?



                                                                482



   1   A.  A little bit.

   2   Q.  It's like Christians are forbidden to steal, all right?

   3   So this is like, this would be like stealing if you didn't

   4   engage in jihad, if you believed it was necessary?

   5            You have to say yes or no or the court reporter gets

   6   really mad.

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Now, as you sit here today you know that when Bin Laden

   9   told you that America had killed over a million Iraqis since

  10   1991 that is a true statement?  You know that, don't you?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  12            MR. BAUGH:  I believe I already laid the predicate.

  13   I can rephrase it.

  14            THE COURT:  I have problems also with the time

  15   element.

  16            MR. BAUGH:  Okay.  I'm sorry.

  17   Q.  Sir, prior to 1996, you already told us that you were told

  18   that America was responsible directly for the death of a

  19   million Iraqis, right?

  20   A.  Before '96?

  21   Q.  Before 1996.

  22   A.  I don't remember the numbers but they say it's a war it's

  23   going on between Iraq an United States.

  24   Q.  Before 1996, and there was a fatwa issued, Bin Laden told

  25   you that America had killed over a million Iraqis, didn't he?



                                                                483



   1   A.  What I remember they say, yes, thousand of people they

   2   died over there.

   3   Q.  Do you recollect the number one million?

   4   A.  I really don't remember.

   5   Q.  Do you recollect the term one half million children under

   6   the age of 5?

   7   A.  What I remember they say thousand, thousand of children.

   8   Q.  Okay.  And that is true, right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Okay.  And you have also found -- Ms. Laraby,

  11   verification.

  12            You have found verification --

  13            (Witness consults with interpreter):

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection as to form.

  15            THE COURT:  I can't tell until there is more of the

  16   question.

  17            MR. BAUGH:  I will.

  18   Q.  Don't answer the question yet.  You have found

  19   verification from your own studies other than what al Qaeda

  20   told you?

  21            Don't answer it.  No objection?  Yes.

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Object to form.

  23   Q.  Did you find verification from other studies on your own?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Okay.  And if that is true and you believe it to be true,



                                                                484



   1   then do you have a duty under jihad to try and stop that

   2   killing?

   3   A.  If you let me explain.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  I object to the form, your Honor, if

   5   it's true and you believe it to be true.

   6            MR. BAUGH:  Rephrase.

   7   A.  If you let me explain.

   8   Q.  Please.

   9   A.  Well, what I believe is going on in Gulf area is it's more

  10   political because what Saddam did against Kuwait people also

  11   he kill a lot of people, they innocent.

  12   Q.  Yes.

  13   A.  And when Saudi government and the Gulf area government

  14   Kuwait and Bahrain they bring United States and French and

  15   England to help them against Saddam, so it's hard to say it's

  16   religion duty to do that.  This is for what I believe.  Maybe

  17   other scholars they believe something different.  Because we

  18   don't know what Sudam he going to do if nobody stop.

  19   Q.  And that's important because in Islam religious

  20   responsibility is personal responsibility, isn't it?

  21   A.  You're right, but because Sudam he believe that he don't

  22   believe most of Islam.  He got something called Bat.

  23   Q.  Bat is a political party?

  24   A.  Yes, you right.

  25   Q.  I understand there is much more to Islam, and I'm not



                                                                485



   1   going to get into all of it.

   2   A.  Bat is not part of Islam.

   3   Q.  Bat is not Islam?

   4   A.  Yes.  And if you let me explain more?

   5   Q.  Of course.

   6   A.  I remember even Bin Laden by himself --

   7   Q.  Bin Laden himself yes?

   8   A.  In '88 he make lecture against Saddam.  He say Saddam is a

   9   Bat and Saddam one day he going to take all of Gulf area and

  10   he give that lecture and a lot of people listen to that

  11   lecture.

  12   Q.  Now, I want to, correct me if I'm wrong, in paraphrasing

  13   what you just said.

  14            You said that Bin Laden spoke against Saddam Hussein?

  15   A.  You're right.

  16   Q.  He has spoken against him for years?

  17   A.  I remember that in '88.

  18   Q.  In 1988?

   1   Q.  And that was before Saddam Hussein sent his troops into

   2   Kuwait?

   3   A.  Correct.

   4   Q.  Now, and those beliefs that we've spoken about here are

   5   the beliefs that caused you to take a bayat?

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.  As to which

   8   beliefs?

   9            MR. BAUGH:  Your Honor, I will rephrase.  I will

  10   rephrase.

  11   A.  Okay.

  12   Q.  Your belief in the death of thousands of Iraqis, your

  13   belief that America was sending troops to occupy Arab

  14   countries, your belief that many children were dying, those

  15   were the reasons you took a bayat?

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Just an objection to form.  One

  17   reason at a time, Judge.

  18            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  19   BY MR. BAUGH:

  20   Q.  Were those some of the reasons?

  21   A.  No, I really, I'm not understand what you try to tell me.

                                                                487



   1   a bayat and offer up your life?

   2   A.  They want to focus on Jihad.

   3   Q.  And Jihad is defending Muslims?

   4   A.  No, Jihad means to bring Islam back, to bring government

   5   Muslim.

   6   Q.  Isn't it true, sir, that Jihad can only be in defense in

   7   the cause of Allah?  I mean, there are other reasons; that's

   8   one of them?

   9   A.  Jihad is so many different roles.  So one of the Jihad to

  10   make Jihad, being make the whole country Muslim.

  11   Q.  Let me ask you, is one of the reasons the defense of the

  12   cause of Allah, not for conflict?

  13   A.  That's one of the Jihad.

  14   Q.  Is another reason to restore peace and freedom of worship?

  15   A.  That's part of it.

  16   Q.  Is another reason for freedom from tyranny?  You know

  17   tyranny?

  18            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Is another reason when led by a spiritual leader to

  21   accomplish these goals?

  22            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  23            THE INTERPRETER:  Can you please repeat?

  24   Q.  Is another of these reasons when led by a spiritual leader

  25   to accomplish these goals?



                                                                488

   2   Q.  Is that correct?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4            MR. BAUGH:  And you want to spell khalifa.

   5            THE INTERPRETER:  K-H-A-L-I-F-A.

   6            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you.

   7   Q.  Is it also true with Jihad that Jihad should only be

   8   fought until the enemy lays down his arms?

   9            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  10   A.  Yes.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And is it also true that, if possible, women, children,

  12   old, sick are not to be harmed?

  13            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  14   A.  You're right.

  15   Q.  And trees and crops are not to be damaged?

  16            THE INTERPRETER:  Pardon me?

  17   Q.  Trees and crops are not to be damaged?

  18            THE INTERPRETER:  Treason?

  19            MR. BAUGH:  Trees.

  20            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  But again, this is your understanding, right?

  23   A.  Yes, this is what Islam.

  24   Q.  You do not consider yourself to be an Islamic scholar?

  25   A.  No, I'm not scholar.



                                                                489



   1   Q.  Do you consider yourself to be an imam?

   2   A.  No.

   3   Q.  And there are imams in the United States and all over the

   4   world?

   5   A.  Yeah, I don't rise to imam.

   6   Q.  Of course.

   7            Is it also correct that your understanding, Jihad

   8   cannot be used for a war of aggression or ambition?

   9            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  10   A.  I don't understand.

  11            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  You cannot use Jihad to oppress other people; is that

  14   correct?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And you cannot use Jihad to force other people to accept

  17   Islam who do not want to accept Islam?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  That's correct.

  20            Now, do you still believe in those things personally?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Since you became -- strike that.  Would you prefer to

  23   consider yourself an informant, a snitch, a turncoat, what?

  24   What do you prefer to use?

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.


<P>                                                               490



   1            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   2            MR. BAUGH:  I'm sorry?

   3            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   4            MR. BAUGH:  I'm sorry.

   5   Q.  Which term, informant --

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7   Q.  Are you offended by "informant"?

   8   A.  Like I have to do that?

   9   Q.  If I call you an informant, a person who gives

  10   information, is that -- does that term offend you?

  11            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  12   A.  About Islam?

  13   Q.  Yes.

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  All right.  Well, when you started aiding the government,

  16   the United States of America, against al Qaeda, what did you

  17   call that as being, an informant?

  18            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  19   A.  Yes, I give them information, you're right.

  20   Q.  Okay.  Since that time has the Witness Protection Program

  21   paid you $794,200.49?

  22   A.  Could you repeat it?

  23   Q.  Has the Witness Protection Program since 1999 paid you

  24   $794,200.49, if you know?

  25            Don't answer yet.



                                                                491



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form, Judge.

   2            THE COURT:  Overruled.

   3   BY MR. BAUGH:

   4   Q.  Have they paid you that much money?

   5   A.  They pay my rent and they give me money for food and my

   6   bills.

   7   Q.  Yes, but all that money combined, has it come to

   8   approximately $794,200.49?

   9   A.  I didn't count it.

  10   Q.  Since 1999?

  11   A.  I never count it.  Every month they give me money for my

  12   rent, my house, and some money for food and my bills, that's

  13   it.

  14   Q.  Additionally, since 1997 has the FBI paid you $151,047.02?

  15   A.  No.

  16   Q.  They have not paid you that much, or you don't know?

  17   A.  Where I live, the rent, and they buy food for me, and when

  18   I go to store they go with me to buy some stuff for me.

  19   Q.  Would you disagree if hypothetically the FBI said they

  20   paid you since 1997 $15,047.2?

  21            Don't answer.

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form, "paid you."

  23            THE COURT:  Yes.

  24   BY MR. BAUGH:

  25   Q.  I'm sorry, not paid direct, that's right.



                                                                492



   1            THE COURT:  Cost to the FBI of?  Is that what you

   2   want ask him?

   3            MR. BAUGH:  Excuse me, your Honor?

   4            THE COURT:  Would you disagree with the estimate of

   5   the cost.

   6            MR. BAUGH:  All right.

   7   BY MR. BAUGH:

   8   Q.  Would you disagree with the FBI's cost to sustain you of

   9   being approximately $151,000?

  10   A.  I really, I didn't count it, but if they say that, they're

  11   right.

  12   Q.  All right.  If an Arab -- or, if a Muslim, forgive me --

  13   if a Muslim commits a sin, is it your understanding that that

  14   can prevent him from going to paradise?

  15            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  16   Q.  I can rephrase.

  17   A.  (Through the interpreter) Sins can differ.

  18   Q.  I can rephrase.

  19            Is it a bad thing to refuse to live by the principles

  20   of Islam?

  21   A.  You're right.

  22   Q.  And is Jihad one of the principles under which you are

  23   supposed to live?

  24   A.  Jihad, it's different kind.

  25   Q.  But is it a principle?



                                                                493



   1   A.  Yeah, but it's different kind.  Some Jihad, you don't have

   2   to do it.

   3   Q.  Right, but -- okay.

   4            MR. BAUGH:  May I have just one moment, please, your

   5   Honor?

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.

   7            (Pause)

   8   BY MR. BAUGH:

   9   Q.  Sir, during the time that you were with al Qaeda, did al

  10   Qaeda ever run out of young people or people who were willing

  11   to die --

  12   A.  What mean --

  13   Q.  -- for the faith?

  14            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  15   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  16   Q.  Did the organization, the base, ever run out of people who

  17   were willing to die for Islam?

  18   A.  They don't have enough people?

  19   Q.  Do they have enough people to die or do they have more

  20   than enough people to die?

  21   A.  Yeah, we have a lot of membership.

  22   Q.  No, no, not membership.  Are there lots of people who are

  23   willing to die?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Okay.  So it isn't hard to find recruits who are willing



                                                                494



   1   to give their lives?

   2   A.  You're right.

   3            MR. BAUGH:  Thank you.  Pass the witness.

   4            THE COURT:  The question is whether we take a break

   5   or whether we should continue.

   6            MR. STERN:  If we take a ten-minute break, Judge, I

   7   should still finish by 1:00.

   8            THE COURT:  Yes.  All right.  We'll take a ten-minute

   9   recess.

  10            (Jury not present)

  11            THE COURT:  We'll take a ten-minute morning recess.

  12            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, before we take a recess.

  13            THE COURT:  Yes.

  14            MR. RICCO:  During the cross-examination of the

  15   witness, there were several references made to Islamic law.

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            MR. RICCO:  And I understand that many of the

  18   questions were phrased in the context of this witness's

  19   belief.

  20            THE COURT:  Yes, all of them were.

  21            MR. RICCO:  But the record should be clear that this

  22   is not expert testimony.  Many of the references that this

  23   witness testified to are incorrect.

  24            THE COURT:  Well, there was a big preamble, a very

  25   explicit preamble to the question that, "I'm going to ask you



                                                                495



   1   certain questions with respect to your understanding of

   2   Islam," and the witness has disclaimed being an expert on

   3   Islamic law.

   4            MR. RICCO:  That's fine, your Honor, as long as we're

   5   clear about that, because there were several points that were

   6   made here on this witness's beliefs.

   7            THE COURT:  I'm not clear whether you are asking for

   8   an instruction to the jury or just inquiring whether the

   9   record is clear.

  10            MR. RICCO:  I was going to ask for an instruction,

  11   but given Mr. Baugh's preamble, I don't think an instruction

  12   is necessary at this time.

  13            THE COURT:  Very well.  We'll take a ten-minute

  14   recess.

  15            (Recess)

  16            THE COURT:  I think we're about ready to resume.  If

  17   everybody would be seated, please.

  18            (Jury present)

  19   BY MR. STERN:

  20   Q.  Good afternoon, Mr. Al-Fadl.  I'm David Stern, I'm one of

  18   A.  Yes, they got office over there.

  19   Q.  And you were told during the time you were attending that

  20   mosque that one of the things a good Muslim should do is go to

  21   Afghanistan, protect his brothers there, correct?

  22   A.  You're right.

  23   Q.  And you yourself are not an Islamic scholar, that's fair

  24   to say, isn't it?

  25   A.  I'm not scholar.



                                                                497

   7   Q.  Okay.  My question is before '88 had you been to

   8   Afghanistan?

   9   A.  No.  No.

  10   Q.  So what you knew about what was going on in Afghanistan

  11   was based on what people told you at the mosque and other

  12   places you were with Muslims, correct?

  13   A.  They help Muslim, yes.

  14   Q.  That's where you learned about what was going on in

  15   Afghanistan?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And based on what you were told there, what you learned

  18   there, you made a decision the appropriate thing for you to do

  19   was to travel to Afghanistan, right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And you were traveling to Afghanistan to engage in a

  22   Jihad, correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And that Jihad was to fight enemies of Islam, right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                498



   1   Q.  Those enemies were the Soviet Union back then, weren't

   2   they?

   3   A.  You're right.

   7   Q.  In Peshawar you were getting training that would help you

   8   fight the Jihad against the Soviet Union?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And that training was a camp, and you'll pardon me if I

  11   pronounce this wrong, Khalid Ibn Walid; is that the name of

  12   the camp?

  13   A.  Correct.

  14   Q.  At that camp there would be training on how to use weapons

  15   of one sort or another, right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  They gave you training on how to use explosives of one

   1   battle, this war taking place in Afghanistan was justified,

   2   correct?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And while you were in that camp, part of what you were

   5   supposed to do as a good Muslim was to follow orders, right?

   6   A.  Yes, to make Jihad.

   7   Q.  And so when people higher up told you what to do at the

   8   camp, you would do it, right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  If people more experienced in Jihad than you told you what

  11   to do, you would do it, right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  You yourself, before you got this training, had no

  14   personal knowledge of how to behave there, did you?

  15   A.  I don't understand it.

  16   Q.  Before you got to this camp and received the training, you

  17   had no knowledge of how to use these weapons or what to do in

  18   the battle?

  19   A.  You're right, yes.

  20   Q.  In Pakistan, right?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  So when you would learn those things, you would learn them

  23   in reliance on people above you, correct?

  24   A.  Yes, the people who got experience about training in that.

  25   Q.  Right.  After your training at this camp, you were sent to



                                                                500



   1   what they call a guesthouse, weren't you?

   2   A.  Yeah, Areen.

   3   Q.  Areen was the name of the guesthouse and that was in

   4   Afghanistan, was it not?

   5   A.  Yes, Pakhtia State.

   6   Q.  So, according to you, at that point you had traveled from

   7   Peshawar into Afghanistan to this guesthouse, right?

   8   A.  Peshawar to Khalid camp to Areen camp, over Areen

   9   guesthouse.

  10   Q.  But that guesthouse was the final step before you would go

  11   to the front lines of the war in Afghanistan, right?

  12   A.  Yes, it's before the front line, you're right.

  13   Q.  And at the Areen guesthouse you received more training and

  14   more information, didn't you?

  15   A.  Yes, we help them over there.

  16   Q.  And among the things you received were lectures from

  17   people more knowledgeable than you, isn't that fair to say?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And one of the people you heard lecture, this was back in

  20   1988, was someone named Abu Hajer al Iraqi, correct?

  21   A.  Correct.

  22   Q.  You know that that person has another name, don't you?

  23   A.  Not at that time.

  24   Q.  I'm asking you what you know now.

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                501



   1   Q.  And what is that other name?

   2   A.  Mamdouh Mahmud Salim.

   3   Q.  From now on when I refer to Mamdouh Mahmud Salim or

   4   Mr. Salim, we'll both know who we're talking about, right?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Now, Mr. Salim back in 1988 was already one of those

   7   higher people to whom you listened, wasn't he?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  He was a person with experience in Jihad?

  10   A.  He's scholar.

  11   Q.  Pardon?

  12   A.  He's a scholar.

  13   Q.  He's a scholar?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  But he also had himself fought in Afghanistan, hadn't he?

  16   A.  You're right.

  17   Q.  You knew from what people told you that he was a valorous

  18   warrior in Afghanistan, didn't you?

  19   A.  What mean "valorous warrior"?

  20   Q.  He was a good fighter?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  In addition to being a good fighter, he had expertise in

  23   communications, didn't he?

  24            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  25   A.  I think he studied that.



                                                                502



   1   Q.  Studied communications?

   2   A.  Electronic communications, yes.

   3   Q.  So he was an expert in that, wasn't he?

   4            (Witness confers with interpreter)

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And he was also an expert in the Koran, was he not?

   7   A.  He memorize it.

   8   Q.  They call a Koran?

   9   A.  Memorize it.

  10   Q.  What do they call that?

  11   A.  Qaricept.

  12   Q.  Qaricept, right.  While you were there at Areen

  13   guesthouse, you heard Mr. Salim lecture on Jihad, didn't you?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And you heard him talk about something called a Jihad

  16   fardh al ein, didn't you?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Now, you talked the other day when the government was

  19   questioning you about there being two different kinds of

  20   Jihad, didn't you?

  21   A.  Correct.

  22   Q.  One of those you could join in if you chose to, but you

  23   didn't have to?

  24   A.  You're right.

  25   Q.  But this kind that we're talking about now, Jihad fardh al



                                                                503



   1   ein, was mandatory, that is, you must join or you would not be

   2   a good Muslim?

   3   A.  You're right.

   4   Q.  And that's the kind of battle that they were fighting in

   5   Afghanistan, wasn't it?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  That's why he was telling you that, to convince you and

   8   the other people listening that they were doing the right

   9   thing as a Muslim, right?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And it was their obligation to go and do it as best as

  12   they possibly could?

  13   A.  You're right.

  14   Q.  That wasn't the last time you saw Mr. Salim, was it?

  15   A.  No.

  16   Q.  As a matter of fact, he was a person who was involved with

  17   al Qaeda for as long as you were involved in al Qaeda, wasn't

  18   he?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And even when you left al Qaeda to come and cooperate with

  21   the United States Government, he was still involved with al

  22   Qaeda as far as you knew, wasn't he?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  After you were at the Areen guesthouse, you actually went

  25   to Afghanistan and fought on the front there, right?



                                                                504



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  You went to a place I think you said was called Jaji?

   3   A.  Yes, Jaji.

   4   Q.  And you were there a few months, right?

   5   A.  It could be around two months or a little less.

   6   Q.  And after you were done fighting there, where did you go?

   7   A.  We went back to Peshawar to Bail al Ansar or Ansar

   8   guesthouse.

   9   Q.  While you were fighting in Afghanistan, you met many, many

  10   people, didn't you?

  11   A.  A lot.

  12   Q.  And you formed bonds with those people?

  13   A.  What mean "bonds"?

  14   Q.  Bonds means you became close with them.

  15   A.  Yes, some of them.

  16   Q.  And later on in your career with al Qaeda, people would

  17   ask you, do you know this brother from Afghanistan?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And if you would vouch for that person, if you would say

  20   yes, I know that person --

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  -- then they would believe in that person, right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  That was one of the roles that you played for al Qaeda?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                505



   1   Q.  Because it was thought that if you fought in Afghanistan,

   2   if you cared enough to fight in Afghanistan, then you were

   3   trustworthy, right?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And then you would accept all of the things that al Qaeda

   6   said you should accept, right?

   7   A.  The rule, yes.

   8   Q.  Now, you went to a camp in Khost, isn't that right?

   9   A.  Yes, Khost area.

  10   Q.  And there again, they talked to you, various people talked

  11   to you about religious issues, didn't they?

  12   A.  Yes, in Farouq camp.

  13   Q.  And one of the things they talked to you about was

  14   something I think you referred to as a khalifa, right?

  15   A.  Khalifa.  Al khalifa, yes.

  16   Q.  And "khalifa" means that all of the Muslim world should be

  17   united into a single -- I'm going to use the word country, but

  18   it really means a single entity?

  19   A.  You're right.

  20   Q.  And you believed that, didn't you?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  You believed, for example, that whatever country you were

  23   from, in your case, the Sudan, wasn't as important as the

  24   unity Muslims should have for one another?

  25   A.  I don't understand that.



                                                                506



   1   Q.  Well, Sudan is a nation, right?

   2   A.  Yes, it's country.

   3   Q.  Egypt is another nation?

   4   A.  Another country, yes.

   5   Q.  Somalia is another country?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  But when you talk about khalifa, what you say is all

   8   Muslims should be joined together?

   9   A.  You're right, under one man.

  10   Q.  Under one man, a khalifa?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And that was one of the goals of al Qaeda, wasn't it?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And it was a goal you accepted?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  So you believed that countries that wouldn't accept that

  17   idea were in the wrong, didn't you?

  18   A.  Could you repeat?

  19   Q.  Yes.

  20            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  21   A.  With a little explain more.  You right, but with a little

  22   explanation.

  23   Q.  Okay.  Well, I'll ask you if I want the explanation, but

  24   that's the general idea, isn't it?

  25   A.  Not exactly, but you're right.



                                                                507



   1   Q.  Okay.  At some point the Soviet Union was defeated in

   2   Afghanistan, were they not?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And that was a tremendous victory for Muslims around the

   5   world?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  But after that victory there were a number of men who for

   8   years had been fighting in Afghanistan and had no cause left

   9   to fight, isn't that right?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Those were called the mujahideen?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And those people, those mujahideen, had been fighting for

  14   so long that that was the only thing they really knew how to

  15   do, wasn't it?

  16   A.  You're right.

  17   Q.  So it was at that time, at the end of the war in

  18   Afghanistan, that Bin Laden decided to start al Qaeda?

  19   A.  Before him, another people.

  20   Q.  But it was around the time the war ended in Afghanistan,

  21   wasn't it?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And he began that in part to work towards this khalifa,

  24   correct?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                508



   1   Q.  Now, you were one of the very first people involved with

   2   Bin Laden, weren't you?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  You were or were not?

   5   A.  No, I work with him, yes, in the beginning.

   6   Q.  But there were other people before you who decided to

   7   start al Qaeda?

   8   A.  You're right.

   9   Q.  It was when they first began to sign people up, you were

  10   one of the first three people to sign up?

  11   A.  I'm the third one in Farouq camp, but I don't know if some

  12   people to sign in other locations before me or after me.

  13   Q.  Well, either way, it was very early in the existence of al

  14   Qaeda --

  15   A.  You're right.

  16   Q.  -- that you signed up, wasn't it?

  17   A.  Yes.  Yes.

  18   Q.  So you're familiar with the history of al Qaeda from very

  19   near the time it began until the time you left to come and

  20   cooperate with the United States Government, right?

  21   A.  Yes.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Now, since the time you fought for those two or three

  23   months in Afghanistan, have you been involved in using guns

  24   against anyone?

  25   A.  Could you repeat the question?



                                                                509



   1   Q.  Yes.  You fought in Afghanistan for a few months, right?

   2   Didn't you?

   3   A.  When I went, when I was in Afghanistan.

   4   Q.  When you were on the front in Afghanistan in Jaji?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Did you use guns there?

   7   A.  Small gun?

   8   Q.  Yes.

   9   A.  No.

  10   Q.  Did you use rifles there?

  11   A.  We use big weapons.

  12   Q.  Big weapons?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  That you were firing at people to kill them?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Trying to kill your enemies?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Since that time when you were done fighting in Jaji, you

  19   left and you went to Khost and eventually you joined al Qaeda.

  20   Since that time when you used those weapons in Jaji have you

  21   ever fired a weapon, a gun, a cannon, any kind of weapon in at

  22   any other people?

  23   A.  No, only training.

  24   Q.  Pardon?

  25   A.  Training.



                                                                510



   1   Q.  Only training, but you've never actually fired a gun at

   2   anybody?

   3   A.  No.

   4   Q.  You began to move up in al Qaeda, didn't you?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Now, you remember that Mr. Herman asked you about al Qaeda

   7   having a structure like a pyramid; you remember him asking you

   8   that?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And you agreed it was structured like that, right?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And you know what he meant by that, don't you?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  At the very tip of the pyramid, who would be there?

  15   A.  Bin Laden.

  16   Q.  Who would be right below Bin Laden?

  17   A.  Different committee, regular committee, financial

  18   committee and the media committee and the fatwah committee.

  19   Q.  And when you talk about the people altogether, what do you

  20   call them?

  21   A.  We got Bin Laden, shura council and the committees.

  22   Q.  Okay.  So it's Bin Laden at the very top?

  23   A.  Yes.  Shura council.

  24   Q.  Then committees?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                511



   1   Q.  But below those committees, there are many people involved

   2   in al Qaeda, aren't there?

   3   A.  Yes, lots of.  Yes, you're right.

   4   Q.  There are people who work in al Qaeda factories, for

   5   example, right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  There are people who worked in the tannery you mentioned

   8   where they tan cowhides?

   9   A.  You're right.

  10   Q.  There are people who worked in the oil factories, which

  11   you were familiar with?

  12   A.  You're right.

  13   Q.  And those people weren't involved in making the major

  14   decisions about al Qaeda, were they?

  15   A.  I --

  16            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  They were not?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Maybe I'm asking the question poorly.

  21            Were those people involved in making the big

  22   decisions about what al Qaeda was going to do?

  23   A.  Which people?

  24   Q.  The penal working in the tannery, working in the oil

  25   factories, things like that?



                                                                512



   1   A.  The people move.  Sometime you are in regular committee,

   2   you move to financial committee, you move to business, you

   3   move to fatwah.

   4   Q.  Okay.  I'm not asking about the people in any of the

   5   committees.  In the oil factories, someone had to take sesame

   6   seeds and crush them to get oil out of them, right?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And someone ran a machine that did that?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  That person wasn't on the fatwah committee, were they?

  11   A.  Was what?

  12   Q.  The person who was crushing the oil seeds in the factory,

  13   was he or she on the fatwah committee?

  14   A.  It could be before he was.  It's hard to say now.

  15   Q.  How about someone driving a truck, delivering that oil,

  16   were they on the fatwah committee?

  17   A.  It's hard to say yes or no.

  18   Q.  Why don't you tell me.

  19   A.  Because if you don't specific about person, his name, it

  20   could be easy for me to answer.

  21   Q.  Okay.  Well, you tell me the name of the person on the

  22   shura committee who was driving a truck, delivering sesame

  23   oil.

  24   A.  And he's a shura council?

  25   Q.  Yes.  Which one of the people do you know of Banshiri, you



                                                                513



   1   name someone whose job was delivering oil and they were on the

   2   shura.

   3   A.  It's -- if he's in driving truck and he's a shura council,

   4   yes, if the shura council got meeting, they call him and they

   5   tell him shura's got a meeting, come talk, you come.

   6   Q.  I'm asking you which guy that is.

   7   A.  Banshiri or Abu Hafs.

   8   Q.  So Banshiri drove a truck delivering oil?

   9   A.  No, Banshiri, he worked in the military committee.

  10   Q.  On the military committee.

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  That was his job, right?

  13   A.  He's head of the military committee, right.

  14   Q.  So tell me which member of the shura council had a job,

  15   for example, driving a truck or taking cowhides and making

  16   them --

  17   A.  Qaricept, Egyptian, he work with financial, he been

  18   selling for al Qaeda people, he run some companies and he's in

  19   shura council.

  20   Q.  And he runs companies?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Okay.  I'm asking about the people who work in that

  23   company sweeping the floors, polishing the floors, are any of

  24   those people on the shura council?

  25   A.  I don't remember.



                                                                514



   1   Q.  Well, if you remember one of them, tell me, okay?

   2   A.  Okay.

   3   Q.  Now, you know that Salim was part of the shura council,

   4   don't you?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Salim was in charge of communications equipment, right?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And Salim was one of the people on this shura council who

   9   helped make --

  10   A.  Fatwah.

  11   Q.  Pardon?

  12   A.  Fatwah council.

  13   Q.  And he helped make the important decisions that guided al

  14   Qaeda, didn't he?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Now, there came a time, did there not, when al Qaeda was

  17   making a decision whether or not they should move from

  18   Afghanistan to Sudan?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And one of the people who went to the Sudan to help make

  21   that decision was Salim, right?

  22   A.  Yes, he was discovered.

  23   Q.  And it's fair to say, is it not, that Salim was one of Bin

  24   Laden's favorites?

  25   A.  He's best friend.



                                                                515



   1   Q.  Right?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Very close with him?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And he would speak at Bin Laden's side sometimes, right?

   6   A.  Speak?

   7   Q.  Speak next to Bin Laden.  Bin Laden would speak and then

   8   Mr. Salim would speak?

   9   A.  Sometimes.

  10   Q.  And when he had something to say, because he was so

  11   high-ranking in al Qaeda, Bin Laden would listen to him,

  12   wouldn't he?

  13   A.  Sometimes, yes.

  14   Q.  So Salim, as far as you know, goes to the Sudan, right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And he's going to check to see if that's a good place for

  17   al Qaeda to move to?

  18   A.  You're right.

  19   Q.  Before he went, he didn't have a good feeling about the

  20   Sudan, did he?

  21   A.  I don't remember.

  22   Q.  Do you remember he didn't really trust the NIF?

  23   A.  Not trust, but agenda.

  24   Q.  I'm sorry?

  25   A.  Not trust, but what al Qaeda agenda and Islamic National



                                                                516



   1   Front agenda and what they believe about them.

   2   Q.  They had different agendas?

   3   A.  On what scholars they follow.

   4            Al Qaeda, we have scholars.

   5            MR. STERN:  I have interpreters.

   6   Q.  I understand.  I understand.

   7            So Salim went there and he went with other people,

   8   right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And at some point he came back?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Now, he was one of the people who spoke to you and to the

  13   other members of al Qaeda to explain whether or not it was a

  14   good idea to move to the Sudan, wasn't he?

  15   A.  Yeah, he make lecture in Farouq camp first.  He make a

  16   lecture.

  17   Q.  A lecture?

  18   A.  In Khost in Farouq camp.

  19   Q.  And said, it turns out it's okay?

  20   A.  Yeah.

  21   Q.  I met with them, they seem like good people?

  22   A.  And some people ask him questions about his trip.

  23   Q.  And so, we should go there?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And al Qaeda did move there, did they not?



                                                                517



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  After al Qaeda moved there, there was a farm called Soba,

   3   wasn't there?

   4   A.  Repeat question.

   5   Q.  Was there a farm where there used to be a meeting every

   6   Thursday?

   7   A.  Yes, we have Thursday meeting.

   8   Q.  Where was that farm where it was?

   9   A.  The big farm, the farm number one.

  10   Q.  Farm number one?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  At those Thursday meetings, Salim would sometimes speak,

  13   wouldn't he?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And sometimes Bin Laden would speak, right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And Salim would give explanations based on the Koran for

  18   why the things al Qaeda was doing were okay, were good, right?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And he would quote from the Koran and try to convince

  21   people through those quotes that what al Qaeda was doing and

  22   what you were being asked to do was something that a good

  23   Muslim would do, right?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  So, for example, at one time Salim gave a speech in which



                                                                518



   1   he quoted from the Koran where it said there should be no

   2   other religions in our islands, do you remember that?

   3   A.  In Arab islands.

   4   Q.  What do you mean by that?

   5   A.  In Arab islands:  Yemen country, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,

   6   Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Muscat, Jordan, Palestine, this is Arab

   7   islands.

   8   Q.  And he meant, did he not, that the khalifa should take

   9   those Arab countries and make sure that they were completely

  10   Muslim, Arab countries for the Muslims, right?

  11   A.  It's for Prophet Mohamed.  He say Prophet Mohamed says

  12   they not allowed to let two religions in Arab islands.

  13   Q.  Okay.  Now, you yourself don't know every line of the

  14   Koran, do you?

  15   A.  No.

  16   Q.  And so when he would talk to you about lines from the

  17   Koran, according to you, he would tell you these things and

  18   you would accept them as the truth, wouldn't you?

  19   A.  Yeah.

  20   Q.  You didn't think that Salim was manipulating the Koran to

  21   do things he or Bin Laden wanted to do, did you?

  22   A.  It's not thinking, it's about different scholars, they

  23   understand different opinion from Koran.

  24   Q.  Well, you yourself don't have the knowledge to make that

  25   decision, do you?



                                                                519



   1   A.  No, maybe I read, but not -- you're right, I follow them.

   2   Q.  So, according to you, when Salim would tell you something,

   3   he was the scholar you chose to accept?

   4   A.  You're right.

   5   Q.  You respected him, right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Just like you respected Bin Laden?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And so when he would say that quote to you and tell you

  10   what it meant, you would say okay?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  But you also were aware, are you not, that there may be

  13   other Islamic scholars who think differently?

  14   A.  You're right.

  15   Q.  Now, according to you, on another occasion Mr. Salim gave

  16   another speech in which he talked about the killing of

  17   civilians in Jihad, do you remember that that?

  18   A.  Yeah, I remember that.

  19   Q.  Do you know of your own knowledge -- not from what

  20   Mr. Salim told you, but of your own knowledge -- very much

  21   about Ibn Tamiyeh?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  You do know a lot about him?

  24   A.  No, he got 36 books, so I don't know everything he say,

  25   but some of them.



                                                                520



   1   Q.  Out of those 36, how many of them have you read?

   2   A.  I read a lot about 28 about Jihad, the book 28.

   3   Q.  You read one book?

   4   A.  Yes, they call it Jihad book.

   5   Q.  That's the only book you read out of 36 books he wrote?

   6   A.  I focus with this more than others.

   7   Q.  Would the answer be, yes, that that's the only book you

   8   read out of the 36 he wrote?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Now, when -- by the way, in Islam there's tremendous

  11   respect for scholars, right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  As a matter of fact, when it comes down to a debate of

  14   some kind about what's correct, what's Islamically correct,

  15   you look back to scholars and say what do the scholars say

  16   about that, right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And so when someone more knowledgeable than you tells you

  19   that a scholar said one thing or another, that really

  20   influences you, doesn't it?

  21   A.  Some people, they go different scholars to find which one

  22   he got more about that.

  23   Q.  Well, in his speech, according to you, Mr. Salim talked

  24   about -- am I saying this person's name right, Tamiyeh?

  25   A.  Mohamed Ibn Tamiyeh.



                                                                521



   1   Q.  Tamiyeh.  He told you what Tamiyeh had said back in 17 or

   2   1800 about a war with the Tartans, right?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And had you read that part for yourself?

   5   A.  I don't remember.

   6   Q.  Well, he told you what that part said?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Was that sometimes in a war civilians get killed, right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And that that's okay, because if they're good people,

  11   they're lucky enough to go to heaven quicker?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And if they're bad people, they deserve to go to hell

  14   anyway, right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And that was his way of saying to you and everyone else

  17   listening, it's okay to kill civilians if you have to because

  18   I say it and another scholar says it and that scholar

  19   interpreting the Koran says it, right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  So that was to mean to say to everybody, it's okay, don't

  22   worry if you kill civilians, it's part of what we have to do?

  23   A.  Yes, under war.

  24   Q.  And when you heard that, you accepted it, did you not?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                522



   1   Q.  Now, as you were working with al Qaeda, according to you,

   2   you were involved in many businesses, right?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And you're quite a good businessman, aren't you?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And as a result of your being a good businessperson, you

   7   became more and more trusted --

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  -- by the leaders of al Qaeda?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And you did your best for them, right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And you knew that what you were doing, that is, making

  14   money, would help the rest of al Qaeda do what they were

  15   doing, right?

  16   A.  Yes.  Yes.

  17   Q.  That making money was a critical part of al Qaeda being

  18   able to function, didn't you?

  19   A.  What mean, "function"?

  20   Q.  To get along, to work.

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Now, you knew that al Qaeda was involved in fights all

  23   over the Arab world, right?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  You knew that the money you were making would go to buy



                                                                523



   1   weapons, didn't you?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And you knew that those weapons would be given to soldiers

   4   of al Qaeda, right?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And you knew that those soldiers would use those weapons

   7   to kill people in other countries, right?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  You knew that those weapons were going to southern Sudan,

  10   your own country, right?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  All over the world, right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And wherever they were going, they would be used to kill

  25   people in the name of Islam, right?



                                                                524



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And you were proud to be helping al Qaeda the way you best

   3   could by being a businessperson?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And on some occasions you were even directly involved with

   6   weapons, weren't you?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  There came a time you talked about when you went to Helat

   9   Koko in Khartoum, remember that time?

  12   A.  Yes.

  14   they were making chemical weapons, right?

  15   A.  Yes, that's what I told -- they told me.

  16   Q.  And that's what you believed?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Do you know what chemical weapons are used for?

  19   A.  No.

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Now, I want to talk to you some about 1993 or '94.  There

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And so you went and you met with someone, right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And you tried to get as much information about the uranium

  19   as you could?

  20   A.  Correct.

  21   Q.  You tried to find out if it was enriched or not enriched?

  22   A.  What "enriched"?

  23   Q.  It was ready to be made into a bomb immediately or had to

  24   have something else done to it?

  25   A.  The quality, yes.



                                                                529



   1   Q.  Try to find out what country it was from?

   2   A.  The quality and which land, yes.

   3   Q.  But you yourself were not an expert --

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  -- in uranium, were you?

   6   A.  No, I just, I got the information and I bring it back to

   7   somebody.

   8   Q.  Isn't the somebody you brought it back to Salim?

   9   A.  Abu Musab al Suri.

  10   Q.  Did you ever talk to Salim about this bomb?

  11   A.  I give him the paper.

  12   Q.  Salim?

  13   A.  Yes, but we didn't talk about it.

  14   Q.  But you gave him the paper?

  15   A.  Just the paper.

  16   Q.  And according to you, he told you or you were told that he

  17   was going to get some kind of machine to test this uranium,

  18   right?

  19   A.  Not Salim, Abu Musab Suri told me machine going to come

  20   from Kenya.

  21   Q.  That was to see if this uranium was good enough to build a

  22   bomb to kill a whole lot of people, right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24            THE COURT:  Let me just interrupt, Mr. Stern.

  25   Approximately how much longer do you have?


<P>                                                              530



   1            MR. STERN:  Literally another three minutes.

   2   BY MR. STERN:

   3   Q.  Mr. Al-Fadl, you have been working with the United States

   4   Government since 1996, right?

   5   A.  Correct.

   6   Q.  And you have given them a lot of information that you

   7   gathered through your years of working in al Qaeda, right?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Through your years of working as a high-ranking member of

  10   al Qaeda, right?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And the agreement you reached with them ensures you won't

  13   be executed, right?

  14   A.  What means "execute"?

  15   Q.  You won't be killed.

  16            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  17   A.  No.

  18   Q.  It ensures you won't spend the rest of your life in jail,

  19   right?

  20   A.  They say up to 15 years.

  21   Q.  That's not the rest of your life.  You don't expect it to

  22   be, do you?

  23   A.  This is what agreement, is up to 15 years.

  24   Q.  But with Allah's help, you don't expect that to be the

  25   rest of your life, do you?



                                                                531



   1   A.  Yeah, 15 years a lot.

   2   Q.  I'm not asking if it's a lot, I'm asking, do you expect to

   3   be alive at the end of it?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  No, you don't?

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7   A.  (Through the interpreter) It's all in God's hands.

   8   Q.  Right.  How about this:  Do you hope to be alive at the

   9   end of 15 years?

  10   A.  Everybody hope that.

  11   Q.  How old will you be then?

  12   A.  52 or 53.

  13   Q.  They also brought your family to this country, didn't

  14   they?

  15   A.  Correct.

  16   Q.  And they have taken care of you and your family since

  17   you've been here, right?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And your hope is that you will even get less than 15

  20   years, isn't it?

  21   A.  I hope.

  22   Q.  Your hope is if you do everything the government wants you

  23   to do, you might never even go to jail at all, right?

  24   A.  Yeah, I hope that.

  25   Q.  Even though you're a high-ranking member of al Qaeda,



                                                                532



   1   right?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3            MR. STERN:  I have nothing else.  Thank you.

   4            THE COURT:  Anything else for today?

   5            MR. HERMAN:  No, your Honor.

   6            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, your lunch is here

   7   and so you are welcome to eat it, and we're going to call it a

   8   day.  We're doing that because one of the attorneys who would

   9   also be cross-examining this witness has the flu and we're

  10   hoping he will be better tomorrow, but if he's not, we'll go

  11   ahead with something else and I'll explain that tomorrow.

  12            And tomorrow we've made arrangements with the

  13   marshal.  You know we're starting a little later than usual

  14   tomorrow.  Thank you.  Enjoy your lunch.  Have a pleasant rest

  15   of the day.

  16            (Jury not present)

  17            THE COURT:  Assuming that, although we wish him well,

  18   that Mr. Schmidt is not available tomorrow and so the

  19   government calls its second witness, are there any matters

  20   which we should fruitfully take up prior to that witness

  21   taking the stand?

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, your Honor.  There's also a point,

  23   if I could make a point about the last cross-examination.

  24            THE COURT:  Yes.

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, particularly the part about



                                                                533



   1   this man going about the business, and this was the type of

   2   testimony that was elicited that was anticipated in our

   3   severance motion extremely prejudicial to Mr. El Hage in terms

   4   of trying to create a question of culpability or levels of

   5   culpability, even though obviously our position is that there

   6   is no evidence Mr. El Hage knew of any of this conduct going

   7   on.  I still think it's extremely prejudicial to, in the

   8   linkage in the jurors' minds, the type of reason we wanted a

   9   severance from the death penalty defendants in the first

  10   place.  So I renew that motion at this time.

  11            THE COURT:  Denied.

  12            My question is:  Are there any matters that we could

  13   take up before the witness, assuming the next witness takes

  14   the stand?

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  I was having a

  16   discussion with Mr. Dratel about, in particular, two issues.

  17   I don't think we have achieved resolution.  I don't know if

  18   we've given up on achieving resolution yet, but we should

  19   probably maybe talk over lunch and then advise your chambers

  20   if we should come back or do it now.

  21            THE COURT:  I'm available all afternoon.  And my

  22   preference, obviously, is to take up such matters before we

  23   have a jury in the jury box or about to come in the jury box,

  24   and if there are some matters that the Court can fruitfully

  25   deal with this afternoon, simply call chambers.



                                                                534



   1            MR. DRATEL:  Okay.

   2            MR. RUHNKE:  One inquiry to the government:  We have

   3   been given Jencks material on two witnesses.  Is it the

   4   government's intention to call both witnesses?  They both

   5   appear not to be lengthy witnesses.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  We will be available to call both

   7   witnesses.

   8            MR. DRATEL:  Will or won't?

   9            THE COURT:  Both.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Both.  We will have both available

  11   and I will tell counsel at the break which order we intend to

  12   go in.

  13            MR. RUHNKE:  Thank you.

  14            THE COURT:  Subject to a telephone call to chambers,

  15   we're adjourned until I think 10:30 tomorrow.

  16            (Adjourned to 10:30 a.m. on February 14, 2001)
