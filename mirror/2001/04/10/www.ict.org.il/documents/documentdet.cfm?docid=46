   1            (In open court; jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  All right.  All be seated.  I think the

   3   jury is about to come in.

   4            (Jury present)

   5            THE COURT:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

   6   You've inquired as to more precise dates for vacations as we

   7   call it, and I'll respond to that question later.  The witness

   8   al Fadl has not yet been cross-examined on behalf of the

   9   defendant El Hage, and Mr. Schmidt, who is the attorney who

  10   had prepared to do that, is still out with the flu.  So what

  11   we will do is we will ask the government to call its next

  12   witness, and we'll proceed understanding that Mr. Al Fadl will

  13   return to the stand on Tuesday for cross-examination on behalf

  14   of the defendant El Hage, and, then, if it wishes, redirect

  15   examination by the government.

  16            So I'd ask that the government call its next witness.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, sir.  I believe that there was

  18   an agreement that your Honor would read a stipulation at the

  19   start of the day.

  20            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you recall I told

  21   you that a stipulation was an agreement among the parties that

  22   if called a certain witness would testify in a certain fashion

  23   or that certain facts were true, and this is the stipulation

  24   with respect to certain facts being true.  And that's evidence

  25   that is before you.  Those are undisputed facts, and you may



                                                                539



   1   treat that as evidence.

   2            This is a stipulation agreed by and between the

   3   United States of America and the defendants by and with the

   4   consent of their attorneys as follows.

   5            1.  On December 27, 1979 the Soviet Union invaded

   6   Afghanistan, a country with a predominantly Muslim population.

   7            2.  In response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

   8   groups of Muslims formed an armed force that became known as

   9   the Afghan Mujahadeen.  The Afghan Mujahadeen fought the

  10   invading Soviet force and the Soviet-supported Afghan

  11   government.

  12            3.  In 1986 during its occupation of Afghanistan, the

  13   Soviet Union installed Mohammed Najibullah as president of

  14   Afghanistan.

  15            4.  On February 15, 1989, the last Soviet troops

  16   departed from Afghanistan.

  17            5.  From the time of the departure of Soviet troops

  18   from Afghanistan in February 1989, through the dissolution of

  19   the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet Union provided economic

  20   and military support to the Najibullah government in

  21   Afghanistan.

  22            6.  From shortly after the start of the Soviet

  23   invasion in Afghanistan in 1979, through September 1991, the

  24   United States, through one of its intelligence agencies,

  25   provided economic and military support to the Afghan



                                                                540



   1   mujahideen through a third country intermediary.

   2            7.  Beginning in 1987 the American military support

   3   to the Afghan mujahideen included stinger antiaircraft

   4   missiles.

   5            The parties have so stipulated, and, as I said, those

   6   are facts which are not disputed and are in evidence before

   7   you.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  The government now calls Essam al

   9   Ridi.

  10    ESSAM AL RIDI,

  11        called as a witness by the government,

  12        having been duly sworn, testified as follows:

  13            THE DEPUTY CLERK:  Please be seated.  Please state

  14   your full name.

  15            THE WITNESS:  Essam al Ridi.

  16   DIRECT EXAMINATION

  19   Q.  Can you tell the jury why not?

  20   A.  Actually there was a civil unrest in Pakistan due to the

  21   conflict between Ali Batu and martial laws of that time, so

  22   they closed the universities for a month.  I could not stay

  23   any longer.

  24   Q.  If you could speak a bit slower to make sure, and a little

  25   bit closer to the microphone.



                                                                542

  18   A.  Went back to Kuwait.

  19   Q.  And for what reason?

  20   A.  Find a job.

  21   Q.  Did you find one?

  23   Q.  So what did you do then?

  24   A.  I came back to the US and worked as a flight instructor in

  25   the same school.



                                                                543



   1   Q.  And what year was it that you returned?

   2            MR. DRATEL:  I didn't hear the last answer.

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Can the court reporter read the last

   4   answer back, and I'll ask the witness if you keep your voice

   5   up and sit up about 12 inches in the chair and look at the

   6   microphone it be easier.

   7   A.  Not with my knees, no.  I'll try.

   8            THE COURT:  Maybe you can bring that microphone down.

   9   Q.  Okay.  Why don't we try it, if you could try to talk at

  10   the microphone and if you keep your mouth about nine inches

  11   from the microphone I think it works.

  12            (Record read)

  13   Q.  Did there come a time when you were in Karachi Pakistan

  14   studying that you met a person by the name of Sheik Abdallah

  15   Azzam?  A-B-D-A-L-L-A-H, Azzam, A-Z-Z-A-M.

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And can you explain to the jury how you came to meet Sheik

  18   Abdallah Azzam?

  19   A.  The Egyptian embassy located in Islamabad, which is the

  20   political capital of Pakistan, and Sheik Abdallah used to be

  21   one of the professors at the Islamic school, Islamic

  22   university I should say, in Islamabad.  It was customary of

  23   him to invite as guests and give us not really a lecture, just

  24   a casual thing for about maybe half and hour to forty-five

  25   minutes at his house.



                                                                544



   1   Q.  And you mentioned the Egyptian embassy.  What country were

   2   you a citizen of when were you studying in Pakistan?

   3   A.  Country of Egypt.

   4   Q.  And when you moved to the United States did there come a

   5   time when you saw Sheik Abdallah Azzam again?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Can you tell us when and where that was?

   8   A.  Must have been 1982 or '83 I'm not sure, but it was the

   9   MAYA convention at the time.

  10   Q.  You mentioned MAYA.  Is that M-A-Y-A?

  11   A.  Yes, sir.

  12   Q.  And do you know what the initials MAYA stand for?

  13   A.  Muslim American Youth Association.

  14   Q.  What role did you play in this convention in 1982 or 1983?

  15   A.  I was helping in reorganizing part of the convention since

  16   I resided in Fort Worth where the convention was held, so it

  17   was very normal of me knowing the city to help in the

  18   organizing part of the convention.

  19   Q.  And what role did Sheik Abdallah Azzam play in that

  20   convention?

  21   A.  He was one of the guest speakers.

  22   Q.  And do you recall what Sheik Abdallah Azzam spoke about at

  23   the convention?

  24   A.  Yes.  He spoke about jihad in Afghanistan.

  25   Q.  So we're clear, who is the jihad in Afghanistan against at



                                                                545



   1   that time?

   2   A.  Of course was against the Russians.

   3   Q.  And what did Sheik Abdallah Azzam say about the jihad

   4   against the Russians?

   5   A.  He indicated to Muslims attending the convention, and of

   6   course Muslims worldwide, that it is an obligation upon

   7   Muslims to help in any way they could to help the Afghan

   8   jihad.

   9   Q.  Did Sheik Abdallah Azzam indicate what type of jihad the

  10   war in Afghanistan was?

  11   A.  You're referring to?

  12   Q.  What type of jihad?

  13   A.  It's, we have fardh al ein and fardh al khafiya.  Fardh al

  14   ein means if it's an obligation upon all Muslims if the

  15   immediate circuit of the immediate country that have been

  16   oppressed cannot really defend itself.

  17   Q.  So that was the F-A-R-D-H-A-L-E-I-N, that's the obligation

  18   to fight jihad, correct?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And the other one you mentioned, fardh al khafiya.

  21   F-A-R-D-H-A-L-K-H-A-F-I-Y-A, what type of jihad is that?

  22   A.  That's similarly the same type of jihad except --

  23            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, I have an objection.  Is

  24   this witness' own personal opinion?

  25            THE COURT:  Clarify.



                                                                546



   1   Q.  Yes.  If you can just tell us your personal understanding

   2   what you understand jihad fardhalkafya to mean?

   3   A.  Of course.  It means that if a group of people are helping

   4   the oppressed country and they are covering enough ground and

   5   giving enough help, then it become only obligatory on this

   6   group of people, not of the rest of the Muslims.

   7   Q.  What do you recall that Sheik Abdallah Azzam said about

   8   the jihad in Afghanistan during the time of the convention in

   9   Fort Worth, Texas?

  10   A.  That it's fardh al ein.

  11   Q.  Following that speech that you heard by Sheik Abdallah

  12   Azzam did you do anything immediately?

  13   A.  No.

  14   Q.  What were you doing at the time for work, and were you

  15   married?

  16   A.  Yes, I was married, and I had one daughter and my wife was

  17   pregnant with the second child.

  18   Q.  Did there come a time when you spoke to Sheik Abdallah

  19   again?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  When was that?

  22   A.  After he left Texas, left the convention, there were quite

  23   a few phone calls between us asking certain people who would

  24   be interested to help in Afghanistan.

  25   Q.  And did there come a time when you left the United States?



                                                                547



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And when was that?

   3   A.  The early part of 1983.

   4   Q.  What year?  Sorry.  Early part you mentioned, I didn't

   5   hear it.

   6   A.  1983.

   7   Q.  '83.  Where did you go?

   8   A.  I went to Peshawar Pakistan, Islamabad specifically.

   9   Q.  Now, during, do you know a person by the name of Wadia El

  10   Hage?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Can you tell us about how long you know him?

  13   A.  Must have been since 1983 onwards.

  14   Q.  Do you recall where it was you first met him?

  15   A.  Not really I'm not sure if I met him first in the States

  16   or not during that time.

  17   Q.  Met him in both places?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  Now, can you tell us what happened when you got to

  20   Peshawar Pakistan in 1983?

  21   A.  We met Sheik Abdallah, spent the night at his house.  The

  22   following morning we went to Peshawar to meet Abdul Rasool

  23   Sayyaf who is at the time was the leader of the Afghanis.

  24   Q.  I believe we're spelling that as A-B-D-U-L R-A-S-O-O-L

  25   S-A-Y-Y-A-F.  Can you tell us did you bring your family when



                                                                548



   1   you moved to Pakistan?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And what happened when you met Sheik Abdul Rasool Sayyaf?

   4   A.  It was very important to me to make sure from my

   5   understanding Sheik Abdallah my understanding would be Islamic

   6   religion to make sure that I'm needed specifically to reside,

   7   that my help will be actually needed to the extent of residing

   8   in Peshawar, however, rather than just giving them some help

   9   from the States.  So I had the liberty to ask Sayyaf himself

  10   in a meeting and ask him if my help will be very important to

  11   them or needed.

  12   Q.  And what were you told?

  13   A.  I was told, yes, I'm needed there.

  14   Q.  And did you offer any particular skill that you could give

  15   them to help them in their effort?

  16   A.  The only two skills that I know is flying and I know how

  17   to travel around the world.

  18   Q.  And what did they say?

  19   A.  They said, well, there is no flying of course, but I could

  20   be needed in traveling and shipping few things for them.

  21   Q.  And did you do that?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And for how long did you do that while residing in

  24   Pakistan?

  25   A.  18 months.



                                                                549



   1   Q.  And where did you yourself reside in Pakistan?

   2   A.  In Peshawar.

   3   Q.  And where did your family reside?

   4   A.  At first must have been maybe six to eight months my

   5   family resided in Karachi, because there were no flat or house

   6   allocated to us, so I left my wife and kids in Karachi with my

   7   brothers, and I myself resided in Peshawar.

   8   Q.  And can you tell the jury what you did to aid the cause

   9   during those 18 months?

  10   A.  As I said earlier, basically traveling and getting them

  11   items that they need.

  12   Q.  Can you describe what those items were?

  13   A.  Well, some of which were was like scuba diving equipment,

  14   range finders, night vision goggles and night vision scopes.

  15   Q.  Can you briefly explain?

  16   A.  Sometimes video equipment, batteries, it was so sometimes

  17   and so used sometimes.

  18   Q.  Can you briefly explain what a night vision goggle is?

  19   A.  Yes.  It's a technology that if you, if you wore those

  20   goggles you would be able to be, to see individuals and

  21   vehicles at night.

  22   Q.  What's a range finder?

  23   A.  It's an equipment where you'll measure range with.

  24   Q.  Does it tell you how far a certain object is?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                550



   1   Q.  Can you tell the jury where you bought this various

   2   equipment?

   3   A.  I bought the range finders from England.  The scuba diving

   4   equipment also from England.  The night vision scopes were

   5   from the US.  Later on the night vision goggles were also from

   6   the US.

   7   Q.  Can you tell us roughly how much scuba equipment you

   8   bought?

   9   A.  Two sets.

  10   Q.  And how many range finders did you buy?

  11   A.  Six.

  12   Q.  Do you recall how many night scopes you bought?

  13   A.  Six.

  14   Q.  And did you travel to any countries other than the United

  15   States and to England?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  What other countries did you travel to buy things?

  18   A.  Japan, Kuwait, Saudi.

  19   Q.  And did there come a time when you, while you were in

  20   Pakistan that you met a person by the name of Usama Bin Laden?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Can you tell the jury how that came about?

  23   A.  The first actual visit to Peshawar was with his other

  24   brothers, and two gentlemen who supposed to be from somewhere

  25   in Europe, they spoke English with an accent.  And I was



                                                                551



   1   invited to that meeting to interpret between English and

   2   Arabic to Sheik Sayyaf and Sheik Abdallah.

   3   Q.  And did you actually do that at the meeting?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And did you meet Usama Bin Laden on any other occasions

   6   while you were then living in Pakistan?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Approximately how many times?

   9   A.  Well, at that time he was not living in Pakistan.  He came

  10   another time when we had a camp for the --

  11            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, when the witness says "we,"

  12   just if he could be more precise.

  13   Q.  You said "we" had a camp.  Could you --

  14   A.  Yes, I'm relating to, I'm referring to Sheik Abdallah

  15   office having some activities to the Afghan I leaders, the

  16   small ones like if he's a leader of twenty to fifty troops he

  17   was invited to that camp to be taught in the proper way of

  18   worshipping because most of them have a lot of sympathy to

  19   Islam, they pray, of course they do their own duties, but not

  20   necessarily to the standard of the scholars of Sheik Abdallah,

  21   so he wanted to really teach them those ways and methods of

  22   how to worship God, how to come closer to God, and of course

  23   that will be also beneficial for them in the front.

  24   Q.  And when you say Sheik Abdallah, are you referring to

  25   Sheik Abdallah Azzam?



                                                                552



   1   A.  Yes, I am.

   2   Q.  And did Azzam Bin Laden appear at that camp?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Did there come a time when you yourself decided to leave

   5   Pakistan and move back to the United States?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Can you tell us when that was?

   8   A.  1985.

   9   Q.  And can you tell us why you decided to leave Pakistan and

  10   come back to the States?

  11   A.  Actually, I had some reasons related to the cause itself.

  12   Other related to personal reasons.

  13   Q.  Can you tell us both?

  14   A.  Yes.  Reasons related to the cause were the fact that my

  15   passport was about to expire.  This is the main tool for me to

  16   travel.  I was almost the only one who have had a valid

  17   passport.  The Egyptian passport is very difficult to come

  18   about, especially if you have selective service which is the

  19   military service.  My passport at the time had only about

  20   three months duration and perhaps maybe one or two pages left.

  21            I was traveling extensively almost every 15 days to

  22   20 days.  I was so many stamps I really could not sustain a

  23   new passport.  I have approached Sheik Abdallah and the people

  24   in charge asking them to put somebody with me doing the same

  25   job or perhaps I could show him where I go, and you know



                                                                553



   1   people that I know.  I was not successful.  Other reasons

   2   were --

   3   Q.  Let me stop you there for a moment.

   4   A.  Sure.

   5   Q.  You mentioned selective service.  Can you explain to the

   6   jury why the selective service issue would make it hard for

   7   you to renew your Egyptian passport?

   8   A.  If you are Egyptian citizen you have to serve in the

   9   military.  It's an obligation on you upon graduation from

  10   college, which the assumption was that I was already by then

  11   graduated, age 26.  27 is the final age where you have to

  12   submit yourself to the military service.

  13   Q.  So we're clear, had you ever served in the Egyptian

  14   military?

  15   A.  No.

  16   Q.  If you can continue with the other reasons?

  17   A.  So then the other internal reasons were things really

  18   between us.  I was one of the people invited to special

  19   meetings with Sheik Abdallah to organize the work of the Arabs

  20   and the visitors in Peshawar, and things of, you know,

  21   important nature to Afghani, how are we helping them,

  22   including donations and things.

  23            One of the main sticking issue was I was totally

  24   opposing the fact that any rich individual who comes to

  25   Afghanistan would control the decision making.  I think they



                                                                554



   1   have, you know, pure, I mean pure feeling to the code, but I

   2   don't think he have the experience to be involved in the

   3   day-to-day running of the business in Afghanistan.  I was very

   4   much opposed to that and I, my voice was very well heard out,

   5   but nobody really acted on it.  I have asked other scholars,

   6   I've asked other colleagues.  I think I was right and I took a

   7   stand on that.

   8   Q.  Now, at the time you came back to the States what was the

   9   status of your aviation license?

  10   A.  It was expired.

  11   Q.  And what were the prospects of your renewing the license

  12   while in Pakistan?

  13   A.  Almost impossible.

  14   Q.  And why was that?

  15   A.  Well, first of all, I can't fly in Pakistan.  I can't fly

  16   anywhere else.  I have to come to the States since it's an FAA

  17   license, and of course it's very expensive to renew.  I've

  18   been offered help from Sheik Abdallah on few occasions, but it

  19   was not really enough to renew the license.

  20   Q.  And what was the status of your personal financial

  21   situation supporting your family in Pakistan?

  22   A.  I only had what I needed actually, and most of the time,

  23   well, sometimes I lived with less than what I needed.

  24   Q.  And when you came back to the United States where did you

  25   move?



                                                                555



   1   A.  I moved back to Arlington, Texas.

   2   Q.  In what year was this?

   3   A.  1985.

   4   Q.  And what did you do for work when you came back to the

   5   United States?

   6   A.  Work as a flight instructor again.

   7            THE COURT:  What was that?

   8            THE WITNESS:  Flight instructor.

   9   Q.  When you were back beginning in 1985 did you ever render

  10   any further assistance to the cause of the jihad in

  11   Afghanistan?

  12   A.  Yes.  That was one of the things that I have proposed to

  13   them, I'm not needed.  We are not in line together when it

  14   comes to the ideology.  It will be best that I move back and

  15   I'll still provide the help that you all need.

  16   Q.  Can you give us examples of what it is that you did to

  17   help from the United States?

  18   A.  The second set of night vision goggles were actually

  19   shipped at that time I resided back in the US.

  20   Q.  And how many night vision goggles were they?

  21   A.  Eleven.

  22   Q.  How did you ship them from the United States to

  23   Afghanistan?

  24   A.  Just as a passenger luggage.

  25   Q.  And who was the passenger that you gave them to?



                                                                556



   1   A.  Wadia.

   2   Q.  Is that Wadih El Hage?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Is it your understanding -- what year was this?

   5   A.  Must have been 1987 or '88, I'm not sure.

   6   Q.  What was your understanding of what the night vision

   7   goggles were to be used for?

   8   A.  You mean -- well, they use is actually to use it at night

   9   because most of the mujahadeen movement is at night.

  10   Q.  Was it for the jihad against the Russians?

  11   A.  Yes, of course.

  12   Q.  Did you ship any other equipment from the United States to

  13   Pakistan or Afghanistan?

  14   A.  You mean in that capacity passenger or --

  15   Q.  No, in any capacity during the time from 1985 to 1990?

  16   A.  Yes, I did.

  17   Q.  What else did you ship?

  18   A.  I shipped Barrett rifles, 50 calibers.

  19   Q.  B-A-R-R-E-T-T.  How many of those did you ship?

  20   A.  25.

  21   Q.  And so we're clear, did Wadih El Hage have anything to do

  22   with that transaction?

  23   A.  No.

  24   Q.  And can you tell us what a 50 caliber rifle is?

  25   A.  This is supposed to be a heavy caliber, but the advantage



                                                                557



   1   of it is carried by individuals so it's made in such a way

   2   where you could have a heavy cannon, but mobile by an

   3   individual.  That's basically it.  And it's very compatible to

   4   the Russian caliber 12.7.

   5   Q.  And, again, was it your understanding that these weapons

   6   were to be used in the jihad against the Russians in

   7   Afghanistan?

   8   A.  Yes, of course.

   9   Q.  Now, did you ever see the rifles in Afghanistan yourself?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Can you tell us how it came to be that you saw the rifles

  12   in Afghanistan?

  13   A.  How what, sir?

  14   Q.  How did it happen that you were in Afghanistan and you saw

  15   these rifles?

  16   A.  I received a fax of them having difficulty sighting the

  17   scopes on the rifles, so I was asked --

  18   Q.  Can you explain what "sighting the scopes" means?

  19   A.  It's lining the scope with the rifle barrel so whatever

  20   you see you'd have a hit.  That's as simple as I can put it.

  21   Q.  So what did you do after you received the fax?

  22   A.  I planned a trip and I went to Peshawar and sighted the

  23   scopes for them.

  24   Q.  Do you recall approximately what year this was?

  25   A.  It's the year of it must have been 1989 because that's the



                                                                558



   1   same year where Sheik Abdallah was assassinated.

   2   Q.  Now, did there come a time when you obtained a green card

   3   in the United States?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Do you know what year that was?

   6   A.  '86, '87.

   7   Q.  And did you ever obtain American citizenship?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Do you know what year that was?

  10   A.  1994.

  11   Q.  And are you known --

  12            MR. COHN:  That was that last answer?

  13   Q.  Can you just repeat the last date?

  14   A.  1994.

  15            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

  16   Q.  And are you known by any name that begins with Abu?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  What's the name that you're known by that begins with Abu?

  19   A.  Abu Tareq.

  20   Q.  T-A-R-E-Q?

  21   A.  Yes, sir.

  22   Q.  Did there come a time when you became involved in

  23   purchasing an airplane for Usama Bin Laden?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Can you tell us what year that was that you first became



                                                                559



   1   involved?

   2   A.  1993.

   3   Q.  And can you tell us how it came about that you became

   4   involved in buying an airplane?

   5   A.  There was quite a few communications between me and Wadih

   6   El Hage about the interests of Usama aquiring an airplane used

   7   in Khartoum.

   8   Q.  When you had these conversations where were you?

   9   A.  In the States.

  10   Q.  And where did you understand Wadih to be?

  11   A.  Khartoum Sudan.

  12   Q.  Do you know when it was that he moved to Khartoum Sudan?

  13   A.  I can't really recall the specific year, but it must have

  14   been maybe 1998.

  15            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, the basis of his knowing.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  I'll withdraw the question, your

  17   Honor.

  18   Q.  When you spoke to him about the airplane transaction where

  19   did you understand him to be?

  20   A.  Say again, please?

  21   Q.  When you spoke to Wadih El Hage about the airplane where

  22   did you understand that Wadih was?

  23   A.  In Khartoum.

  24   Q.  Did you ever call him directly from the States?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                560



   1   Q.  And did you dial a number for the Sudan?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Can you tell us what Wadih El Hage told you when he first

   4   contacted you?

   5   A.  The interests of Usama Bin Laden in aquiring an airplane

   6   for Khartoum.

   7   Q.  And did you, did he tell you where Usama Bin Laden was

   8   living at the time?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Where was he living?

  11   A.  In Khartoum, Sudan.

  12   Q.  And what did he tell you about the airplane that he wished

  13   you to purchase for Usama Bin Laden?

  14   A.  The price range within 350,000 US, and that is a range of

  15   about a little bit over two thousand miles.

  16   Q.  And did you have any further discussions with him about

  17   the financial arrangements for purchasing this airplane?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  What was that discussion?

  20   A.  Once I located an airplane with that price and that range,

  21   I've called Wadih and specifically told him, it's 350,000 and

  22   I'll be offered 9 percent from the dealer, the owner of the

  23   airplane.

  24   Q.  And what did you mean, you'll be offered 9 percent?

  25   A.  This is a customary commission when you buy or sell an



                                                                561



   1   aircraft in the US.

   2   Q.  And who would the commission go to?

   3   A.  To me.

   4   Q.  And did you have any discussions with anyone as to whether

   5   or not it was proper for you to receive a commission on this

   6   airplane transaction?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Who did you discuss this with?

   9   A.  I discussed it with my best friend Moataz al Hallak.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  We'll spell that M-O-A-T-A-Z A-L

  11   H-A-L-L-A-K.

  12   Q.  What was your understanding of what was a proper way to

  13   obtain a commission?

  14   A.  I have what I say knowledge about our religion and how to

  15   go about these things, but I wanted to make sure because

  16   Moataz in fact is much more knowledgeable than me.  So I asked

  17   him what will be the best way for me to get any commission out

  18   of that sale without of course compromising our rules as

  19   Muslims.  He suggested that, first of all, I have to become an

  20   owner of the entity, and, thereafter, I could be, since I'm an

  21   owner, I could resell it to a price that I choose to the new

  22   owner.

  23   Q.  And did you discuss this at all with Wadih El Hage?

  24   A.  No.

  25   Q.  And what did you tell Wadih El Hage about how the



                                                                562



   1   financial arrangements would work regarding the airplane?

   2   A.  Well, actually this part did not really go through.  They

   3   came later with a different price.  Instead of 350, anything

   4   less than 250.

   5   Q.  You say "they came."  Can you explain who?

   6   A.  I'm indicating Wadih El Hage and you know representing of

   7   course Usama in Khartoum.

   8   Q.  And what did he tell you about the changed price?

   9   A.  They wanted something within the 250,000 or less, and my

  10   response was, you'll never get a used jet aircraft for that

  11   price that will do the range that you want.

  12   Q.  And what happened then?

  13   A.  Actually, they came with that final decision, it doesn't

  14   matter.  This is the budget and let's try to work with that

  15   budget.

  16   Q.  Was there any discussion of the reason why the range for

  17   the plane had to be two thousand miles?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  Can you tell us what was said?

  20   A.  They have some goods of their own they want to ship from

  21   Peshawar to Khartoum.

  22   Q.  And first of all, who is "they"?

  23   A.  Again, I'm referring to Wadih and Usama.

  24   Q.  And did he tell you what the goods were that he wanted to

  25   ship from Peshawar to Khartoum?



                                                                563



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  What were they?

   3   A.  Stinger missiles.

   4   Q.  And when he told you they wanted to ship Stinger missiles

   5   from Peshawar to Khartoum, what did you say?

   6   A.  I said it's possible as long as we have arrangements from

   7   the departing country to the arriving country.

   8   Q.  And what do you mean by that?

   9   A.  I meant the legality, because it's clearly air policy.

  10   Q.  Did you discuss this with Wadih?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Tell us what you told him about the legality of shipping

  13   the Stingers from Peshawar to Khartoum?

  14   A.  That we have to have a legal permit to depart Peshawar

  15   with that equipment on board, and the legal permit to land in

  16   Khartoum, which is not a problem because they could ally

  17   people in Peshawar and also in Khartoum.  However, the problem

  18   with allies, once we have to divert or land for any fuel or

  19   any emergency in the countries in between, then it will be

  20   definitely exposed and then it will be absolutely a chaos.

  21   Q.  And what, if anything, did he say in response?

  22   A.  Nothing in particular.  I was just explaining to them

  23   technicalities.

  24   Q.  And did you have a further discussion after that

  25   conversation about shipping stinger missiles?



                                                                564



   1   A.  I don't think so, no.

   2   Q.  Did you ever actually transport yourself stinger missiles

   3   from Peshawar to Khartoum?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  Did you find a plane for the price of less than $250,000?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And what type of plane was it?

   8   A.  Again, with the reduction in the price and the range I had

   9   limited options, one of which was a military aircraft under

  10   the designation of T389 which is the equivalent of a civilian

  11   aircraft called Saber-40.

  12   Q.  And did you find one?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And what was the price?

  15   A.  210,000 after I finished all the modifications that I

  16   needed to do.

  17   Q.  What kind of modifications did you do on the plane?

  18   A.  Well, the airplane were in a storage what we call boneyard

  19   in Tucson, Arizona.

  20   Q.  Is that boneyard?  B-O-N-E like bones, boneyard?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Can you explain what happened then?

  23   A.  So we pulled the aircraft out of the storage and we had to

  24   go through certain checks mechanically and officially of

  25   course to certify again and make it acceptable by the FAA to



                                                                565



   1   fly the civilian aircraft.

   2   Q.  Did you do all those things?

   3   A.  Yes, sir.

   4   Q.  And where did the money come from to acquire the plane?

   5   A.  From Khartoum.

   6   Q.  And approximately how much money came from Khartoum if you

   7   recall?

   8   A.  About a total of 230, 230, around that figure.

   9   Q.  230 dollars or 230,000 dollars?

  10   A.  Thousand dollars.

  11   Q.  Did you put any of your money toward the purchase of the

  12   airplane?

  13   A.  Well, that initial part of the plan actually.  I put up,

  14   me and Moataz and another friend a sum of $10,000 where we

  15   acquire the airplane and started the process.

  16   Q.  Now, once you acquired the plane did you have any

  17   discussions with Wadih El Hage in the Sudan about the

  18   acquisition?

  19   A.  No.

  20   Q.  What did you do with the plane?

  21   A.  I bought it as I said, I finished the, I reconditioned --

  22   well, actually I refurbished it completely, and the avionic

  23   equipment, updated the version of avionics and also new paint.

  24   And we took off from Dallas-Fort Worth to Khartoum.

  25   Q.  Did you actually fly the plane yourself from the United



                                                                566



   1   States to Khartoum?

   2   A.  Yes, I did.

   3   Q.  Can you tell us the route just generally the route that

   4   you took?

   5   A.  The airplane had a range of about 1500 miles.  You cannot

   6   really cross the Atlantic with that range.  So we had to go up

   7   north almost to the Pole and cross down to mainland.  So we

   8   took the first one was Dallas-Fort Worth, Slte. St. Marie at

   9   the Canadian borders.  From there on to a place 67 lat north,

  10   I think it's Furbisher Bay, Canada and then from Fervershaw

  11   Bay, Canada to Iceland to Lucan, Rome, Cairo, Cairo, Khartoum.

  12   Q.  How long did it take you to fly the plane from Dallas

  13   through the various stops to Khartoum, Sudan?

  14   A.  It should have taken two days at the most but actually we

  15   had some technical problems due to the bad weather in

  16   Fervershaw Bay.  It was minus 65, so we lost hydraulics and we

  17   had a crack in all the window.

  18   Q.  How long did it actually take you to get there?

  19   A.  About a week.

  20   Q.  Do you recall approximately when was that you flew the

  21   plane from the United States to Sudan?

  22   A.  The early part of 1993.

  23   Q.  And what happened when you arrived in Khartoum with the

  24   plane?

  25   A.  In the sense of if you can explain the question please.



                                                                567



   1   Q.  You land the at Khartoum with the plane.  What do you do?

   2   A.  Nothing.  I just parked the airplane, took permission in

   3   the civil aviation authorities there and I was met with Wadih

   4   and I'm not sure maybe another driver or so.

   5   Q.  And where did you go with Wadih and the driver?

   6   A.  We went to Wadih's house.

   7   Q.  And what did you do there?

   8   A.  Had lunch with him.

   9   Q.  Did there come a time when you met Usama Bin Laden on that

  10   trip?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  When was that?

  13   A.  It must have been the same day, at night, we were offered

  14   dinners on his behalf.

  15   Q.  And where was the dinner held?

  16   A.  At his guest house.

  17   Q.  And who was present for the dinner?

  18   A.  Quite a few people, but people that I could identify were

  19   me, Wadih, Usama, a guy by the name of Abu Jaffer.  I think

  20   also another guy by the name of Loay, and, yes, that's the

  21   names I could recall.

  22   Q.  We're spelling L-O-A-Y and J-A-F-F-E-R.  Do you know what

  23   nationality Abu Jaffer was?

  24   A.  Yes, he's from Iraq.

  25   Q.  What role did Abu Jaffer play at the dinner?



                                                                568



   1   A.  This was my first time to be introduced to him and he led

   2   the prayers at the night.

   3   Q.  And let me show you what has been previously received in

   4   evidence a number of photographs beginning with Government

   5   Exhibit 100 in evidence.  If we could display that on the

   6   screens.

  13   Do you recognize the person depicted in Government Exhibit

  14   101?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Who is that?

  17   A.  Abu Hafs.

  18   Q.  How do you know Abu Hafs?

  19   A.  I met him briefly in Peshawar, and thereafter I think he

  20   must have been over the dinner, too, with Usama.

  21   Q.  Do you know what nationality he is?

  22   A.  Egyptian.

  23   Q.  Let me show you Government Exhibit in evidence 103.  Do

  24   you recognize the person depicted in Government Exhibit 103 in

  25   evidence?



                                                                569



   1   A.  Yes, Abu Ubadda.

   2   Q.  How do you know this person, Abu Ubadda?

   3   A.  At the same dinner, too.

   4   Q.  And had you ever met him before that day?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  Did you ever meet him after that day?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Where was that?

   9   A.  Well, around the office the next morning.

  10   Q.  Let me show you Government Exhibit 106 in evidence.  Do

  11   you recognize the person depicted in Government Exhibit 106 in

  12   evidence?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Who is that?

  15   A.  Abu Jaffer.

  16   Q.  Is that the Abu Jaffer who was at the dinner that evening?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  What happened at the dinner?

  19   A.  Nothing actually.  We just had dinner and chatted and just

  20   had a customary thing I gave the keys of the airplane to Usama

  21   Bin Laden.

  22   Q.  And you gave him the keys to what?

  23   A.  The keys to the airplane.

  24   Q.  And did you see any weapons at the dinner?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                570



   1   Q.  What kind of weapons were there?

   2   A.  The AK-47.

   3   Q.  And how many did you see?

   4   A.  I really can't count, but there was quite a few.

   5   Q.  And did you see any people in uniform at the dinner?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And what kind of uniform were they wearing?

   8   A.  It's a military uniform and of course from their

   9   complexions they are Sudanese.

  10   Q.  And did you have any agreements or arrangements to meet

  11   with Usama Bin Laden after the dinner?

  12   A.  We collectively agreed on to come to the airport the next

  13   morning to look at the airplane.

  14   Q.  And what happened the next morning?

  15   A.  I went early morning to the airplane, got it ready,

  16   cleaned it from the previous flight, and waited for Usama.

  17   Q.  And did he show up at the airport?

  18   A.  No.

  19   Q.  What happened then?

  20   A.  Then I was told to go to the office.  I had few other

  21   receipts and balance thing to finish with the accountant, and

  22   to meet with Usama.

  23   Q.  And did you go to the office?

  24   A.  Yes, I did.

  25   Q.  Can you describe the area in which the office is located?



                                                                571



   1   A.  I can't really recall the name, but due to Khartoum

   2   standard it's a good area.

   3   Q.  Was it in an area with residences or office buildings, if

   4   you remember?

   5   A.  Residences.

   6   Q.  When you got to the building can you tell us how you got

   7   to Usama Bin Laden's office once you entered the building?

   8   A.  Yes.  As you enter from the main door you go through a

   9   small hallway, then thereafter to another hallway where

  10   there's a tight staircase, under which would be the office of

  11   the accountant, then you go upstairs to Usama's office.

  12   Q.  And once you go up the stairs to the second floor, how do

  13   you get from the stop of the stairs to Usama Bin Laden's

  14   office?

  15   A.  There's another hallway with a small desk.  Then one room

  16   leading to another room.

  17   Q.  And do you know who was sitting behind the small desk?

  18   A.  That would be the office of Wadih.

  19   Q.  And you said there was one room leading to another room.

  20   Did you go through the first room to get to the second room?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And what was in the first room?

  23   A.  That would be the office of Abu Jaffer, the general

  24   manager.

  25   Q.  And what was in the second room?



                                                                572



   1   A.  The office of Usama Bin Laden, the chairman.

   2   Q.  And do you know what the name of the company was for which

   3   this office was maintained?

   4   A.  Yes, it's called Wadi al Aqiq.

   5   Q.  What happened once you got into the office with Usama Bin

   6   Laden?

   7   A.  We were supposed to discuss an offer for me to work with

   8   them.

   9   Q.  And, first of all, can you tell us who was present for

  10   this meeting?

  11   A.  Only me and him.

  12   Q.  And can you tell us what the discussion was about this

  13   offer of employment?

  14   A.  The offer was the earlier discussed over the phone with

  15   Wadih, and I said we will delay those things until I come

  16   there and see Khartoum itself.  So Usama wanted to continue on

  17   that offer.

  18   Q.  And tell us what the offer was?

  19   A.  The offer was to work with him to fly that particular

  20   airplane and to also set up and operation of crop dusting

  21   because he's into the agriculture business.  Thereafter, if we

  22   have any produce, we will have a cargo shipping company that

  23   will ship the produce to the other countries.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Could we have the court reporter

  25   read back the last answer.



                                                                573



   1            (Record read)

   2   Q.  And to be clear, was there any discussion with Bin Laden

   3   at that time about whether he wanted you to fly the plane for

   4   business or for jihad?

   5   A.  It was very, well, let me just go back one step if you

   6   allow me.  Before we start discussing the offer I had few

   7   things to discuss with Usama on a personal level relating to

   8   the days in Peshawar, and relating to my stand that led me to

   9   leave Peshawar.  I told him regardless what you think I want

  10   you to hear it from me.  I do oppose the fact that you are a

  11   rich man and trying to be a military leader.  At the time I

  12   did not think that you have any military background, nor did

  13   you have any military experience.  Thus, I think that what you

  14   have done to some of the guys is flat killing, not jihad.

  15            Now, perhaps after so many years you have gained so

  16   much experience, and now it's a different situation.  He said,

  17   well, thank you very much.  He was very acceptable of the

  18   critiques.  And later he said, this is not jihad.  This is

  19   strictly business, and this is an official certified company

  20   in Khartoum.

  21   Q.  And what did he say you would be paid for your work as a

  22   pilot?

  23   A.  Say again, please?

  24   Q.  Did he tell you how much you would be paid to work as a

  25   pilot for this business?



                                                                574



   1   A.  Yes, one thousand two hundred US dollars.

   2   Q.  And what did you say to the offer?

   3   A.  I said this is to do what exactly of the three jobs?

   4   Q.  And when you're referring to the three jobs, what do you

   5   mean?

   6   A.  I mean flying the airplane, doing the crop dusting and the

   7   cargo.

   8   Q.  And what did he say?

   9   A.  He said no, that's the offer.  This is the highest that

  10   I'm paying around the company for my highest officers.

  11   Q.  Did he indicate who his highest officers were?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Who did he say?

  14   A.  Abu Jaffer.

  15   Q.  And what did you say after his response?

  16   A.  I said, that's fine.  I have heard enough about Khartoum.

  17   There is a high inflation in the country, schools are very

  18   expensive for expatriates.  The furniture also is very

  19   expensive.  It is not healthy environment at all, so I guess

  20   it's going to cost me much more than that.  So if you are

  21   paying this price for your highest officers that does not mean

  22   that I should be paid equivalently because I do a different

  23   job.

  24   Q.  And did you take the job during that meeting?

  25   A.  No.



                                                                575



   1   Q.  Did you discuss the possibility of taking the job with

   2   anyone else while you were in Khartoum?

   3   A.  No.

   4   Q.  And did you discuss the salaries being paid by Bin Laden

   5   to his employees with anyone else in Khartoum?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And who did you discuss that with?

   8   A.  With Wadih.

   9   Q.  Where did you discuss that?

  10   A.  At his home.

  11   Q.  And can you tell us what you said and what he said?

  12   A.  Of course being a friend and being therefore maybe a year

  13   or so would have more experience about the living conditions

  14   and having to go about it and also he would have more

  15   experience about how they run their business and what are the

  16   salary scales.  So I was trying to get that information from

  17   him.

  18   Q.  And what did he tell you?

  19   A.  I did not get any specific number from him.  All he

  20   mentioned that one thousand two hundred US dollars is the

  21   highest paid salary at the company.

  22            THE COURT:  That's one thousand two hundred dollars

  23   per?

  24            THE WITNESS:  Per month, sir.

  25   Q.  Did he indicate anyone who received that salary at the



                                                                576



   1   Wadi al Aquiq company?

   2   A.  I'm not sure.

   3   Q.  Did he tell you what he himself made?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  Did you ask him that?

   6   A.  Delicately, yes.

   7   Q.  What did he say in response to your delicate question?

   8   A.  I have received no answer.

   9   Q.  Did you get paid -- you mentioned before that you needed

  10   to get reimbursed for other billings outstanding for the

  11   airplane.  Did you accomplish that when you were in Khartoum?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  How did you do that?

  14   A.  I took the authorization of Usama.  I was then sent to Abu

  15   Jaffer to revise the items, got another authorization from Abu

  16   Jaffer, and then took it to the accountant to do a complete,

  17   well, actually a receipt including all the items, signed it

  18   again from Usama, and took a check to the bank where I had

  19   money.

  20   Q.  Did you leave Khartoum at that time?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Approximately how long had you stayed there?

  23   A.  It must have been maybe three or four days.  I'm not

  24   really sure.

  25   Q.  How did you get back to America once you left the plane

<P>                                                                577



   1   there?

   2   A.  I used KLM as my company.

   3   Q.  Did there come a time when you saw the airplane again?

   4   A.  Yes.

   1   Q.  Can you tell us when that happened and how?

   2   A.  I was asked later to come and do a trip to them from

   3   Khartoum to Nairobi.

   4   Q.  Who asked you to do that?

   5   A.  Wadia.

   6   Q.  When he asked you to do it, where were you and where was

   7   he?

   8   A.  I was in the U.S. and he was in Khartoum.

   9   Q.  And how long after you returned from delivering the

  10   airplane was it before you received this call from Wadia

  11   asking you to come back?

  12   A.  It must have been few months because the aircraft was

  13   still in good condition.

  14   Q.  Was still in what kind of condition?

  15   A.  Good condition, good flying condition.

  16   Q.  Did you go back?

  17   A.  Yes, I did.

  18   Q.  What happened when you got back to Khartoum?

  19   A.  Nothing.  I just prepared the aircraft and flew between

  20   Khartoum and Nairobi with a loan first officer from Sudan

  21   Airs.

  22   Q.  Can you explain what a loaner first officer is?

  23   A.  It's somebody you loan just for the flight, not on your

  24   pay, not paid, you know, on a salary thing.  It's, you just

  25   loan him on the -- for the flight.



                                                                579



   1   Q.  Is there a requirement that you have two pilots on a

   2   flight?

   3   A.  Yes, for most jet aircraft there is a requirement.

   4   Q.  Who or what did you fly from Khartoum to Nairobi?

   5   A.  I flew five gentlemens.

   6   Q.  Do you know the names of the people you flew?

   7   A.  No.

   8   Q.  Can you describe what they look like?

   9   A.  They're all Arabs, dressed differently.

  10   Q.  Could you describe their dress?

  11   A.  Yes.  A few were dressed in the Saudi outfit, some are

  12   dressed in Western and dressed in Yemeni outfit.

  13   Q.  And what happened when you flew these five people down to

  14   Nairobi?

  15   A.  Nothing.  Actually, we landed, they were escorted inside

  16   the terminal.  Me and my first officer stayed at the tarmac

  17   for about maybe an hour and 15, an hour and a half to secure

  18   the aircraft and to have the Customs check the aircraft.

  19   Q.  How long did you stay in Nairobi?

  20   A.  About maybe two nights.

  21   Q.  Where did you go then?

  22   A.  We went back to Khartoum.

  23   Q.  When you went back, did you take the same five people back

  24   to Khartoum?

  25   A.  No.



                                                                580



   1   Q.  Did anyone tell you where they went?

   2   A.  No.

   3   Q.  Do you know what they were doing after they got off the

   4   airplane?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  Do you know if they were taking any other aircraft

   7   anyplace else?

   8   A.  Yes, that was hinted to me by the --

   9            MR. DRATEL:  Objection, your Honor, basis.

  10            THE COURT:  Do you know?

  11   Q.  Answer this question yes or no:  Do you know if they took

  12   another airplane or were planning to take another airplane

  13   once they arrived in Nairobi, yes or no?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Can you just tell us, without telling us what you were

  16   told, how you learned that information?

  17   A.  From the guy who was escorting us.

  18   Q.  And the guy who was escorting you, what was his name and

  19   who did you understand him to be working for?

  20   A.  I can't recall his name.  He was one of the people working

  21   to the same company and facilitating our arrival into Nairobi.

  22   Q.  Which company is this?

  23   A.  Wadi al Aqiq.

  24   Q.  So the person from Wadi al Aqiq told you where the other

  25   people were going?



                                                                581



   1   A.  Yes.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  I would now renew the question as to

   3   what he was told as to where they were going.

   4            MR. DRATEL:  I still have an objection.

   5            THE COURT:  Excuse me?

   6            MR. DRATEL:  I still have the same objection.

   7            THE COURT:  It has some relevance, going someplace

   8   else?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, just the type of aircraft,

  10   without the location.

  11            THE COURT:  Very well.

  12   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

  13   Q.  Can you just tell us what you were told about -- let me

  14   ask this:  Do you know the exact location they were going to,

  15   yes or no?

  16   A.  No.

  17   Q.  Do you know the type of plane they were taking, yes or no?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  Can you tell us what you were told about the type of

  20   aircraft they were taking?

  21            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, same objection.

  22            THE COURT:  No.  It's not -- is it being offered for

  23   the truth?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge, under 801(d)(2)(4) --

  25   (d)(2)(E).



                                                                582



   1            Thank you, Mr. Karas.

   2            THE COURT:  I'll allow it.

   3   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   4   Q.  What were you told about what other aircraft these five

   5   people were taking?

   6   A.  I was told they were taking a King Air aircraft.

   7   Q.  Can you explain what a King aircraft is?

   8   A.  It's in the class of private airplanes, it's a propeller

   9   airplane that you carry about five passengers, five to six

  10   passengers.

  11   Q.  What is the range of the King Air, approximately?

  12   A.  Perhaps maybe 1,000 mile.

  13   Q.  Just so we're clear, at the time that you flew this plane

  14   from Khartoum to Nairobi, where was Wadia El Hage living at

  15   the time?

  16   A.  In Khartoum.

  17   Q.  Did there come a time -- by the way, if I could just ask

  18   you to look around the courtroom and tell us if you see Wadia

  19   El Hage in the courtroom.

  20   A.  You want me to see if he's present?

  21   Q.  Yes.

  22   A.  Yes, he is, right there.

  23   Q.  If you can just describe what he's wearing.

  24   A.  A gray dress.

  25   Q.  Can you describe where he is from say the end of the



                                                                583



   1   table, right to left?

   2   A.  From the right, he's the third on the right.

   3            THE COURT:  The record will show the witness has

   4   identified the defendant El Hage.

   5   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   6   Q.  After you took this jet from Khartoum to Nairobi and

   7   Nairobi back to Khartoum, what did you do once you arrived

   8   back in Khartoum?

   9   A.  I flew back to the U.S.

  10   Q.  And did there come a time when you saw the same airplane

  11   again?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Can you tell us what the circumstances were under which

  14   you saw the airplane again?

  15   A.  Sometime had elapsed and I went back to Cairo and worked

  16   with the Egyptian airline there.  I had a call from Wadia

  17   stating that the airplane is still parked outside for the last

  18   maybe, must have been maybe a year and a half by then and

  19   Usama would like me to take it and try to do some business

  20   with it instead of just parking it there.

  21   Q.  Do you know the year it was that you moved to Egypt?

  22   A.  1993, November.

  23   Q.  So this happened sometime after November 1993?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And at the time you received the phone call from Wadia El



                                                                584



   1   Hage, do you know where he was living at the time?

   2   A.  He was living in Nairobi.

   3   Q.  And what did you do in response to this request?

   4   A.  I said, you know, I will try to check the market near

   5   Cairo and if there is any possibility that we could generate

   6   any business with it, I will call you back, but there is only

   7   one other security matter here:  The fact by then Usama Bin

   8   Laden was very much exposed in the Egyptian media.  He was

   9   not, of course, accepted by the Egyptian government, and it

  10   would be a high concern to me to go to Khartoum because also

  11   Sudan had its own conflict with the Egyptian government at the

  12   time.  So I indicated my concern to Wadia and it would take me

  13   some planning to perhaps come through some other countries to

  14   be away from the Egyptian intelligence.

  15   Q.  Did you eventually check out the market in Egypt for the

  16   use of the airplane for business?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Did you eventually go to see the airplane in Khartoum?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Do you recall the route you took to go from Cairo to

  21   Khartoum?

  22   A.  Yes, I took a flight to Nairobi and --

  23            Shall I continue?

  24   Q.  Yes.

  25   A.  And from Nairobi I took a flight to Khartoum.



                                                                585



   1            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, we're having an interpreter

   2   problem that I think is generated back there.  There is no

   3   interpretation going on.  I'm sorry.

   4            (Pause)

   5            MR. COHN:  Okay, it seems to be solved.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Do we need the last answer read

   7   back?

   8            MR. COHN:  I don't know how far it goes back.  Why

   9   don't we just proceed.

  10            THE COURT:  Why don't you read the last answer.

  11            (Record read)

  12   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

  13   Q.  While you were in Nairobi, did you stop for any length of

  14   time there?

  15   A.  Must have been only one night, perhaps.

  16   Q.  And did you see anyone in Nairobi?

  17   A.  I saw Wadia.

  18   Q.  Where did you stay?

  19   A.  At his house.

  20   Q.  Is this the first time that you saw Wadia in Nairobi?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Did you have any discussion with him about what it was

  23   that he was doing in Nairobi?

  24   A.  Of course, it just came instantly because I had to wonder

  25   why did he leave Khartoum since we had our different opinions



                                                                586



   1   about living in Khartoum and working in Khartoum with Usama.

   2   So I was in a way pleased to see him out of Khartoum.

   3   Q.  And did he tell you why he left Khartoum?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  What did he say?

   6   A.  He said he doesn't work any longer with Usama, he's

   7   working with the German Relief Agency, I believe.

   8   Q.  Did you have any further discussion about his work in

   9   Nairobi beyond that?

  10   A.  No.

  11   Q.  And what happened when you got -- let me ask you this.

  12   Did you have an officer, a second officer with you to fly the

  13   airplane when you went from Cairo to Nairobi?

  14   A.  You mean when I went to Cairo -- to Nairobi as a

  15   passenger?

  16   Q.  Yes.  Did you have a person with you who could help you

  17   fly the plane?

  18   A.  No.  No.

  19   Q.  Did you have any discussion with Wadia El Hage about that

  20   fact?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And what did you say to him and what did he say to you?

  23   A.  He said that there is a new guy in Khartoum, his name is

  24   Nawawi, who is a pilot.

  25   Q.  And what did he tell you about Nawawi?



                                                                587



   1   A.  He would be meeting me.  He knows all things about the

   2   aircraft.  He's just a graduate, actually, he doesn't have any

   3   experience.  That's it.

   4   Q.  What happened when you landed in Khartoum after you left

   5   Nairobi?

   6   A.  I had Nawawi waiting for me.

   7   Q.  What did you do then?

   8   A.  We went to the Hilton and we start discussing about, you

   9   know, the plans and things to do.

  10            THE COURT:  Who started, who entered --

  11            THE WITNESS:  Me and Nawawi, about how to go

  12   around -- about the aircraft and checking it and make sure

  13   that it is in a flyable condition.

  14   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

  15   Q.  And did you have any discussion with Nawawi about where he

  16   received his flight instruction and training?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  What did he tell you?

  19   A.  He said he received his education from the U.S. and he

  20   just barely a graduate.

  21   Q.  And did you actually go see the airplane?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  In what condition was the airplane in at the time you

  24   first saw it?

  25   A.  I would say in a very terrible condition because we had



                                                                588



   1   flat tires, we had melted tires from rubber from the heat and

   2   standing in the same spot for a long time, the engine intakes

   3   and outtakes were full of sand due to sand storms in Khartoum,

   4   no batteries.  We had a problem finding the keys initially.

   5   Q.  Who eventually found the keys?

   6   A.  Nawawi did.

   7   Q.  And what did you do with the airplane?

   8   A.  We also needed to locate where are the batteries and

   9   charge them and then we cleaned the engine's intake and

  10   outlets.  We tried to -- we inflated the tires.  We just did

  11   general check.  We checked the hydraulic systems.  We asked

  12   the mechanic to charge the hydraulic systems.  He did charge

  13   it only with hydraulic fluid, without any nitrogen, which is

  14   part of the charging process of the hydraulic system.  The

  15   fact is that they don't really operate such an aircraft there.

  16   They just operate general aviation propeller aircraft.

  17   Q.  Did there come a time when you took the plane and started

  18   the engines and started to fly the plane?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Who was in the plane who did that?

  21   A.  Nawawi.

  22   Q.  And just the two of you?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Why don't you tell the jury what happened once you started

  25   the engines and started to fly the plane?



                                                                589



   1   A.  We had the first engine start with a lot of fire coming

   2   out of the engine.  It must have been due to some left over

   3   sand.  But anyway, I checked the hydraulic systems to make

   4   sure that we do have hydraulic, and of course the only thing I

   5   could see is the red hydraulic fluid in the manifold.  But

   6   there was no way I could check if it had been positively

   7   charged with nitrogen on top of the hydraulic fluid just

   8   because of the compressure since we do different maneuvers in

   9   the aircraft and because of the compression change.

  10            But anyway, after we managed to have a start, I

  11   decided to fly the aircraft from maybe one take off and

  12   landing, and then thereafter we do some other extensive checks

  13   relating to the avionics equipment.

  14   Q.  So what did you do?

  15   A.  We took off.  It flew fine.  We had some problem with the

  16   power setting.  I decided to make a touch and go, which is a

  17   land without a first stop, again took off again for another

  18   circuit, made another touch, took off for the number third --

  19   number three circuit, and we decided to stop.  I was satisfied

  20   then by the engine parameters that it would be flyable so I

  21   decided to stop.

  22            To my surprise, of course, coming to a stop, I could

  23   not really stop the aircraft.  We lost the main hydraulic or

  24   the main brake system.  I tried the alternate brake system and

  25   I was actually talking to my first officer, who doesn't know



                                                                590



   1   anything about the aircraft, that "I'm doing this now" and

   2   "I'm doing this now" as a way of making sure that I'm doing

   3   the act and also making him up to speed with what's going on

   4   with me.

   5            So I said, we've lost the main brakes, I'm using the

   6   alternate.  We've lost the alternate brakes, I'm using the

   7   hand brakes.  We basically lost all kind of brakes.  We could

   8   not really stop the aircraft.  The last option would be, of

   9   course, to turn off the engines to reduce the propulsion of

  10   the aircraft forward, and I did, which is also very important

  11   to secure the fluid flow into the engines.

  12            So we shut down the engines.  We were still going on

  13   the runway, running out of runway.  The speed we were about 60

  14   knots when we hit a sandpile off the runway.

  15   Q.  And what happened when you hit the sandpile?

  16   A.  The first two things that came to my mind is, of course,

  17   the safety of the first officer, because he had no knowledge

  18   of such equipment.  Secondly is how to leave Khartoum as soon

  19   as I can.

  20   Q.  Focusing on the first concern first, how did you get out


  21   of the airplane?

  22   A.  I actually, as I said, I was briefing the first officer as

  23   I progressed on the runway, and knowing for sure now that we

  24   are getting towards the end, I have instructed him to unbuckle

  25   his seat belt just in case we have an explosion, he would have



                                                                591



   1   run out of the aircraft immediately after we stopped.

   2   Apparently he didn't.  So he was trying to get out of the seat

   3   with his seat belt.  So I unbuckled him.  I went out of the

   4   door.  I shut down the hydraulic and the electric system and

   5   left the aircraft.

   6   Q.  And what did you do once you got immediately outside of

   7   the aircraft?

   8   A.  By then, of course, the tower and everybody else could see

   9   where the aircraft going.  We are -- this aircraft was very

  10   unique to Khartoum.  There is no such private jet aircraft at

  11   Khartoum International Airport.  So because of our take-off

  12   after a year and a half, everybody was really focusing on what

  13   we are doing.

  14            So by the time I left the aircraft, there was a Jeep

  15   or maybe a Toyota truck, don't quote me there, with a guard,

  16   and out of respect to me as a pilot, he did not really ask any

  17   legal questions.  He said, are you okay?  I said, yes, but

  18   could you drop me to the terminal, again because of my concern

  19   to leave the country.  Indeed, he did.

  20   Q.  Can you explain the reasons for your concern, why you

  21   wanted to leave the country so fast?

  22   A.  Well, this is a very, it's a very explosive situation.

  23   It's an aircraft accident.  I'm the only one who flew this

  24   aircraft.  Everybody knows that it is Usama Bin Laden's

  25   aircraft.  Everybody knew then that I'm Egyptian.  The



                                                                592



   1   Egyptians are heavily available in Khartoum and I wouldn't

   2   like to be seen in association with Usama at the time.  So I

   3   was very concerned to leave.

   4   Q.  So what did you do?

   5   A.  Went back to the Hilton, packed, and Nawawi followed me

   6   and I told him I need any flight, any destination out of

   7   Khartoum.

   8   Q.  Do you recall where you went?

   9   A.  I went to Addis Abbaba.

  10   Q.  What did you do when you got there?

  11   A.  It was a transit period in the airport and then I left

  12   from Addis Abbaba to Cairo.

  13   Q.  To this day are you still concerned about the Egyptian

  14   government finding out that you were flying Bin Laden's plane

  15   when it crashed?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  Has the United States Government promised to do anything

  18   for you as a result of your testimony?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Can you tell the jury what that is?

  21   A.  It's the typical protection for a U.S. citizen, because

  22   for some reason the Egyptian government still think I'm

  23   Egyptian, though I go inside the country with my U.S.

  24   passport, and anybody who been around Usama Bin Laden's arena

  25   or in direct relation or in not direct, they would like to



                                                                593



   1   hear from him, and it's annoying the way they do it.

   2   Q.  What is it that the United States Government promised to

   3   do for you to aid in your situation?

   4   A.  To communicate with them and relay to them that I'm not

   5   involved directly with Usama in any of his acts.

   6   Q.  Let me show you a picture on the screen.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  For the moment, Judge, we'll just

   8   display it to counsel and the witness, not yet the audience.

   9   For the record, it's Government Exhibit 108 for

  10   identification.

  11   Q.  Mr. al Ridi, if you could look at that picture and tell us

  12   if you recognize the person in that photograph.

  13   A.  Yes, that's the first officer, Nawawi.

  14   Q.  Is that picture, Government Exhibit 108, a fair and

  15   accurate depiction of what Nawawi looks like?

  16   A.  Yes, it is.

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer Government

  18   Exhibit 108 in evidence.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  No objection.

  20            THE COURT:  You say no objection?

  21            MR. DRATEL:  No objection.

  22            THE COURT:  Received.

  23            (Government Exhibit 108 received in evidence)

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Can we just display it briefly to

  25   the jury and to the public?



                                                                594



   1            (Pause)

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, if I could approach the

   3   witness with Exhibits 601A through 601AD, Adam, David, just

   4   show some photographs to the witness.

   5   Q.  If I could ask the witness to open that binder, and there

   6   are approximately 30 pictures in that book.  If you could look

   7   at each of the pictures, page through it, and then we'll ask

   8   you some questions at the end.

   9            (Pause)

  10   Q.  Do you recognize what's depicted in photographs 601A

  11   through 601AD?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  What is it that's in those various pictures?

  14   A.  It's the aircraft that I flew to Khartoum and I crashed,

  15   unfortunately.

  16   Q.  Is that a picture of the airplane before or after the

  17   crash?

  18   A.  After the crash.

  19   Q.  Do those photographs 601A through AD fairly and accurately

  20   depict what it is that the plane looked like and the general

  21   condition it was in after you crashed it?

  22   A.  It must be.  I have to tell you, I did not really check it

  23   thoroughly once I left.

  24   Q.  But it appears to be the same airplane you flew?

  25   A.  Indeed.



                                                                595



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer 601A

   2   through AD.

   3            MR. DRATEL:  No objection.

   4            THE COURT:  Received.

   5            (Government Exhibits 601A through 601AD received in

   6   evidence)

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  If I could ask the witness to keep

   8   the binder in front of him and we could now display 601A

   9   through AD in sequence on the screens, and I'll ask a few

  10   brief questions of the witness.

  11   Q.  Can you tell the jury what is depicted in the one that's

  12   marked 601?

  13   A.  Yes, this is the nose gear of the aircraft.

  14   Q.  What happened to the nose gear when you hit the sand dune?

  15   A.  Again, as I said earlier, I did not really check what kind

  16   of damage it left on the aircraft.

  17   Q.  Next photograph.  Looking at 601B, what is that?

  18   A.  It's the same piece, the nose landing gear of the

  19   aircraft.

  20   Q.  Moving on to C, what is that piece?

  21   A.  The same piece.

  22   Q.  Do you see a triangular red piece in the middle of the

  23   picture?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  What is that?



                                                                596



   1   A.  That must be part of the wing or the tail area.

   2   Q.  Moving on to D, is that the same piece?

   3   A.  Yes, it is.

   4   Q.  Moving on to E, same piece?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  F, what are those two pieces?

   7   A.  Again, they must be part of the flaps or the tail area.  I

   8   cannot really tell you which part it is, but it's part of the

   9   aircraft.

  10   Q.  Moving on to G, do you recall what that is?

  11   A.  No.

  12   Q.  H.  Anything you particularly recall there?

  13   A.  Again, pieces of the wing and the tail.

  14   Q.  I, moving on to I, do you recall what that piece is?

  15   A.  Yes, either the door or the nose of the aircraft.

  16   Q.  Moving on to J, do you know that piece?

  17   A.  No.

  18   Q.  K, moving on to K, do you know what pieces are depicted in

  19   601K?

  20   A.  Yes, that would be the nose cone and the one at the

  21   further back part of the picture.  The first piece, I don't

  22   know what it is.

  23   Q.  Moving on to L.

  24   A.  Yes, that's the entire aircraft, if that's the right way

  25   to put it.



                                                                597



   1   Q.  Moving on to M.

   2   A.  The same aircraft, forward picture.

   3   Q.  Can you tell from this picture what airport the plane is

   4   being photographed in, if you know?

   5   A.  I can see some crop dusting aircraft in the back.  It must

   6   have been Khartoum airport.

   7   Q.  Moving on to N, as in Nancy.

   8   A.  Again, it's the same aircraft.

   9   Q.  And O, do you know what piece that is?

  10   A.  That must be inside the landing gear bay or the nose bay.

  11   Q.  And P?

  12   A.  That's the same.

  13   Q.  Q?

  14   A.  The left wing of the aircraft.

  15   Q.  R, do you recognize what is depicted in R?

  16   A.  Yes, that must be the pipit tube, the equipment for the

  17   speed.

  18   Q.  How to you spell that?

  19   A.  P-I-P-I-T.

  20   Q.  And S, moving to S, same aircraft?

  21   A.  Same.

  22   Q.  T?

  23   A.  The main landing gear of the aircraft.

  24   Q.  U, same thing?

  25   A.  The same thing.



                                                                598



   1   Q.  V?

   2   A.  That's the whole aircraft from the belly part.

   3   Q.  W?

   4   A.  The same.

   5   Q.  X?

   6   A.  Yes, the same aircraft from the tail side.

   7   Q.  Y?

   8   A.  The nose side of the aircraft.

   9   Q.  Z, same piece of equipment?

  10   A.  Same piece of equipment, yes.

  11   Q.  AA, do you recall what that is?

  12   A.  It must be a part of the aircraft, but I can't really tell

  13   you much.

  14   Q.  And AB?

  15   A.  Again, some hydraulic manifolds and lines.

  16   Q.  AC?

  17   A.  The same.

  18   Q.  And finally, AD?

  19   A.  It's the same.

  20   Q.  Okay.  Just so we're clear, other than seeing pictures,

  21   these particular pictures, did you ever see the aircraft after

  22   you ran out of the Khartoum airport after you crashed?

  23   A.  No.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you.

  25            Nothing further, Judge.



                                                                599



   1            THE COURT:  We'll take our midmorning recess at this

   2   point.

   3            (Recess)

   4            THE COURT:  Let's resume.  Let's bring in the jury.

   5            (Jury present)

   6            THE COURT:  You are being handed a looseleaf page

   7   with the witness's name and his photograph.  In the future

   8   we'll try and get them to you earlier so that if you want to

   9   take notes on the page with the photograph of the witness,

  10   that may be helpful to you during your deliberations.

  11            With respect to the inquiry concerning vacation, our

  12   present thought is not to sit on Friday, August 17th.  We

  13   won't sit on Friday.  We'll adjourn on August 16 and resume on

  14   August 27th.  So that we'll sit on the 27th, we'll sit on the

  15   16th, but not in between.  It seems like a long way away, but

  16   it will be fast upon us.

  17            All right, government's direct is concluded.

  18   Cross-examination on behalf of defendant El Hage, Mr. Dratel.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you, your Honor.

  20   CROSS-EXAMINATION

  21   BY MR. DRATEL:

  22   Q.  Good afternoon, Mr. al Ridi.

  23   A.  Good afternoon to you.

  24   Q.  You were first contacted by the United States Government

  25   in October of 1998; is that correct?



                                                                600



   1   A.  I can't recall the specific date.  It must be '98, yes.

   2   Q.  It was after the indictment had been returned and made

   3   public in this case; isn't that correct?

   4   A.  It is.

   5   Q.  And you were out of the country at the time?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And you were concerned if you came back to the United

   8   States that you might be arrested upon your return upon

   9   meeting with the government officials; isn't that correct?

  10   A.  Correct.

  11   Q.  And you expressed that concern to the government, correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And the government, in effect, did not give you any

  14   guarantees with respect to your coming back and not being

  15   arrested; is that correct?

  16   A.  That's correct.

  17   Q.  But the government informed you that there were no pending

  18   charges against you and they did not know of any other charges

  19   that were going to be brought against you at the time?

  20   A.  That's correct.

  21   Q.  And you were told you were a subject of the investigation;

  22   is that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Do you remember the definition of "subject"?

  25   A.  That my name had surfaced somewhere during the



                                                                601



   1   investigation and they would like to hear from me.

   2   Q.  At the time that you had these concerns, you didn't think

   3   that you had done anything illegal; isn't that correct?

   4   A.  I have done nothing illegal.

   5   Q.  So at the time your concern was purely based on the nature

   6   of the case and the publicity and the fact that your name had

   7   come up in relation to an investigation of a bombing that cost

   8   a lot of lives?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  In fact, you didn't bring a lawyer with you to the

  11   meeting?

  12   A.  No.

  13            THE COURT:  To the meeting with, with whom?

  14            THE WITNESS:  To the meeting with Pat --

  15            MR. DRATEL:  With the government.

  16            THE WITNESS:  With the government, yes.

  17   BY MR. DRATEL:

  18   Q.  Your relationship with Mr. El Hage dates back to 1981,

  19   doesn't it?

  20   A.  I'm not sure of the date, but it goes back long times.

  21   Q.  Now, you met him originally in Lafayette Louisiana; isn't

  22   that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And he was a student?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                602



   1   Q.  He was a student at Southwest Louisiana -- University of

   2   Southwest Louisiana?

   3   A.  I can't recall the name, but must be, yes, one of the

   4   universities in Louisiana, Lafayette.

   5   Q.  Did you meet him in connection with MAYA, which you had

   6   discussed before, the Muslim Youth Association?

   7   A.  Perhaps so.  I'm not sure.

   8   Q.  And in fact, by 1990 you were friendly enough with Mr. El

   9   Hage and found him responsible enough that you were one of the

  10   two persons who certified him for a telephone in Arlington

  11   with the phone company?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And the other person was Moataz al Hallak, who you

  14   mentioned before, correct?

  15   A.  Yes, that's correct.

  16   Q.  You also stated that you met Mr. El Hage in Peshawar in

  17   1982, correct?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  In between --

  20   A.  If I may just -- 1983 and beyond.

  21   Q.  Might you have said 1982 at another time to the

  22   government?

  23   A.  I'm not sure.

  24            MR. DRATEL:  If I may approach, your Honor?

  25            THE COURT:  Yes.



                                                                603



   1   BY MR. DRATEL:

   2   Q.  I would like you to read to yourself what is marked for

   3   identification purposes as 3503-1.  Just read to yourself,

   4   please, the first sentence of the second paragraph.

   5            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, we have references

   6   to documents that are marked 35 and then some number.  Those

   7   are references to documents which the government makes

   8   available to defense counsel pursuant to its obligations under

   9   the law.  That's what 3500 indicates.

  10   BY MR. DRATEL:

  11   Q.  Does that refresh your recollection whether you may have

  12   said it at another time?

  13   A.  Absolutely, it could be anyone here, but what I'm certain

  14   of is 1983.

  15   Q.  Thank you.

  16            In between your first meeting Mr. El Hage and meeting

  17   him in Peshawar in 1983, you also discussed during your direct

  18   testimony a convention held in the United States where Sheik

  19   Azzam spoke?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And Mr. El Hage attended that conference as well, isn't

  22   that correct?

  23   A.  I'm not sure.

  24            MR. DRATEL:  If I may approach again, your Honor.

  25            If you read the first paragraph of 3503-1 at page 2



                                                                604



   1   to yourself.  Let me know when you're finished.

   2            (Pause)

   3   Q.  Does that refresh your recollection that Mr. El Hage

   4   attended the conference?

   5   A.  It refreshes my recollection about the convention, but I

   6   don't recall Wadia being there.

   7   Q.  Did you not tell the government?

   8   A.  No.

   9   Q.  Withdrawn.  Withdrawn, your Honor.

  10            Did you meet with the government on December 9, 1999,

  11   would that sound about right?

  12   A.  I met with the government -- yes, it sounds about right.

  13   Q.  They asked you questions and you answered?

  14   A.  It was in a form of an interview, yes.

  15   Q.  Yes.  And they took notes?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And did you tell the government during that interview that

  18   Mr. El Hage attended the conference?

  19   A.  I don't recall that, as I said.

  20   Q.  It's possible?

  21   A.  It's possible, yes.

  22   Q.  You first saw Sheik Azzam in Pakistan in 1976, correct?

  23   A.  It must have been maybe 1978, a little bit later than

  24   that, actually.

  25   Q.  And it was before the Jihad in Afghanistan, correct?



                                                                605



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  It was before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  But it was -- you found it to be a beautiful speech,

   5   though, correct?

   6   A.  Which one, sir?

   7   Q.  The first one you saw in 1978?

   8   A.  It was not a speech.  It was a casual setting at his

   9   house, having dinner with Sheik Abdallah.

  10   Q.  Did you describe it as a beautiful address, whatever, it

  11   was a lecture?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And you were moved by it?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And you were moved to the extent that you went and sought

  16   out Sheik Azzam afterwards on your own?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And when Sheik Azzam issued the call to Muslims to

  19   participate in Jihad in Afghanistan two years later, that had

  20   an impact on you?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  The Jihad that you -- even though it was a Jihad fardh al

  23   ein as you described it, in fact you made your own decisions

  24   during the course of your participation in it, correct?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                606



   1   Q.  So, as you told us, you withdrew at a certain point

   2   because of personal differences that you had with management

   3   issues?

   4   A.  You could say so.

   5   Q.  And even though you made that decision, you still also did

   6   other things for Jihad in your own way?

   7   A.  Of course.

   8   Q.  That did not violate your own personal principles as to

   9   what you were doing or not doing?

  10   A.  No.

  11   Q.  "No," as in you did it so as not to violate your personal

  12   principles?

  13   A.  Let me clarify.  The fact that I left physically from

  14   Peshawar was not in any mean or shape would remove me feeling

  15   a commitment to the cause.

  16   Q.  Right.  But there were just things that were happening in

  17   Peshawar, and this you did not agree with?

  18   A.  Absolutely.

  19   Q.  And you did not want to participate?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  But you still felt dedicated to Jihad?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  When you went to Peshawar in 1982 there were many groups

  24   of mujahadeen; isn't that correct?

  25   A.  That's correct.



                                                                607



   1   Q.  And one was Sheik Sayyaf, who you described?

   2   A.  Right.

   3   Q.  And isn't it true that Sheik Sayyaf attracted many of the

   4   Arab mujahadeen because of the language issues?  Withdrawn.

   5            The Arab mujahadeen who went to Afghanistan spoke

   6   Arabic, correct?

   7   A.  Of course.

   8   Q.  The Afghani natives do not speak Arabic necessarily,

   9   correct?

  10   A.  Not necessarily, no.

  11   Q.  So there was, to some extent, a language barrier between

  12   the Afghani mujahadeen and the Arab mujahadeen, correct?

  13   A.  On the public sense, but not the leaders.  The leaders,

  14   all of them spoke Arabic to a certain extent.

  15   Q.  But the people who associated themselves with the leaders

  16   tended to be in groups with which they had something in

  17   common?

  18   A.  As I said, you know, something in common are -- you are

  19   referring to the language, Rabbani, Hekmatyar and others spoke

  20   Arabic, but there could be a relation of other natures.  The

  21   language is not the only reason.

  22   Q.  But there are also geographic reasons, certain people

  23   attracted people from certain different states?

  24   A.  Possibly.

  25   Q.  But there are a multitude of groups?



                                                                608



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  You mentioned the four yourself?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And ultimately, Mr. Bin Laden had a group at the time?

   5   A.  Not at the time.

   6   Q.  But later?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Initially he was just a financier, correct?

   9   A.  Correct.

  10   Q.  Now, when you met Mr. El Hage -- withdrawn.

  11            With respect to Sheik Sayyaf, another organization

  12   that he ran was the Bunyan al Mahrsous; is that correct?

  13   A.  That's correct.

  14   Q.  And that's a magazine?

  15   A.  Yes, that is.

  16   Q.  And that was a magazine that was dedicated to information

  17   about the Afghan Jihad?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And that had articles in it about mujahadeen leaders and

  20   battles and information about the Jihad?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And also where to send donations, addresses so people

  23   could send donations?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Mr. El Hage worked for Bunyan al Mahrsous for a time?



                                                                609



   1   A.  I don't recall that, no.

   2   Q.  When you first met Mr. El Hage in Peshawar, he was working

   3   for an aid organization, correct?

   4   A.  I'm not sure really, because the center was such that we

   5   had so many guesthouses, the definition of which exactly are

   6   you working to, which agent or which group was not really

   7   defined, except on behalf of Sheik Abdallah Azzam because it

   8   was the first guesthouse there.  Thereafter, it evolved into

   9   maybe 11 or 10 guesthouses.

  10   Q.  And but you're aware that he was not fighting on the front

  11   lines or fighting in Afghanistan?

  12   A.  As a matter of fact, no, I think he was, but I'm not sure

  13   where and when.  We spoke about it several times.

  14   Q.  And you're aware of his problem with his arm?

  15   A.  Yes, absolutely.

  16   Q.  And essentially, he can't lift objects, heavy objects with

  17   his right arm, correct?

  18   A.  That's correct.

  19   Q.  When you met Mr. El Hage again in the Sudan, when you

  20   visited him in the Sudan the first time, he was already

  21   married; isn't that correct?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And he had children?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Do you know how many children he had at the time?



                                                                610



   1   A.  I think there were five at the time.

   2   Q.  His wife and children were living with him?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  You spoke on direct about obtaining certain equipment for

   5   the mujahadeen while you were traveling, right?

   6   A.  Yes, correct.

   7   Q.  And some of that equipment was obtained in the United

   8   States and some in the United Kingdom, correct?

   9   A.  Correct.

  10   Q.  And to your knowledge, you were not doing anything wrong

  11   in doing that?

  12   A.  No.

  13   Q.  And to your knowledge, that was consistent with the Jihad

  14   in Afghanistan?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  With respect to Mr. Bin Laden, you disagreed with Mr. Bin

  17   Laden with respect to his insistence on controlling how his

  18   money was spent?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  He gave a lot of money, correct?

  21   A.  He did.

  22   Q.  But your objection was essentially grounded in your

  23   interpretation of Islam?

  24   A.  No, actually, in proper management sense.  If you don't

  25   have any expertise in certain fields, you should not make



                                                                611



   1   decisions because then it will be an ill decision.

   2   Q.  Does that have to do with the money as well as just in

   3   terms of battlefield management?

   4   A.  That's what I'm saying.  If you are a financier, you could

   5   just pay the money, of course, to get the credit in the sight

   6   of God.  However, if you don't have any expertise in certain

   7   areas, it would be best not to give any decision making -- not

   8   to be part of the decision making.

   9   Q.  And the decision thinking that you are talking about is

  10   essentially military?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And you thought that his lack of military experience

  13   was -- withdrawn -- that he lacked enough military experience

  14   to make military decisions?

  15   A.  To the extent he was dangerous.

  16   Q.  Yes.  To the extent that it may cost the lives of some of

  17   the people working under him following his orders?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  But when you went back to Peshawar in the late 80s to

  20   sight the scopes on the rifles, in fact that was for Bin

  21   Laden's organization, correct, or his men?

  22   A.  That was to my surprise.  The deal initially was -- well,

  23   again, if you don't mind, I'm just going to take you a step

  24   back.

  25   Q.  I don't know.  I think if you just let me ask the



                                                                612



   1   questions.

   2   A.  Sure.

   3   Q.  We'll just keep it --

   4   A.  Sure.

   5   Q.  -- that way.

   6            It was supposed to be split a different way, correct?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  But then, ultimately, more went to Bin Laden than you had

   9   thought would happen?

  10   A.  Correct.

  11   Q.  And but you went back and you, even after you found out

  12   that Mr. Bin Laden had the rifles, you sighted the scopes for

  13   them?

  14   A.  Because it all happened when I got there, actually.

  15   Q.  But you did it?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  And then when you were asked by Mr. El Hage to purchase

  18   the plane, you went forward with that as a commercial, purely

  19   commercial business transaction, correct?

  20   A.  Absolutely.

  21   Q.  And the same is true when you returned a month or two

  22   later to make the flight to Nairobi?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And the same is true when you came from Cairo to go back

  25   to the Sudan to try to fly the plane again a year and a half



                                                                613



   1   later?

   2   A.  That's correct.

   3   Q.  And all those were purely commercial transactions, having

   4   nothing to do with anything else?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  And this was despite your earlier disagreements and

   7   reservations about Mr. Bin Laden, correct?

   8   A.  Because then the issue was not in existence anymore.  He

   9   is not in Peshawar, he is not in Jihad, I'm not either, so

  10   there is no conflict except we are doing business together.

  11   Q.  Right.  In fact, your rejection of the job offer had

  12   nothing to do really with philosophy with respect to Mr. Bin

  13   Laden, but really a question of what was going to make it

  14   worth your while to move to the Sudan?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  You testified on direct that the plane, that the purchase

  17   of the plane occurred in '93.  Isn't it a fact that it began

  18   earlier, probably August '92?

  19   A.  Could be, because actually the process of negotiating and

  20   talking about the different types and changing the budget a

  21   few times must have taken some time.

  22   Q.  And during the course of that few months, money was wired

  23   into your account from the Sudan, correct?

  24   A.  Yes, that's correct.

  25   Q.  And about $250,000?



                                                                614



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And from the Shamal Bank in the Sudan?

   3   A.  I can't recall the name.

   4   Q.  I want to show you what has been marked as defendant El

   5   Hage A for identification, just ask you to read the first line

   6   of that.  And when you're done, let me know.

   7   A.  "Wadia" --

   8   Q.  Just read it to yourself.  I'm sorry.

   9   A.  Yes, that's correct.

  10   Q.  Thank you.

  11            Does that refresh your recollection that the wire

  12   transfers came from the Shamal Bank in the Sudan?

  13   A.  Yes, it does.  But actually my concern, it wasn't my bank.

  14   Q.  Yes.  And so you were not concerned about having wire

  15   transfers come from the Sudan into your account in Texas?

  16   A.  No.

  17   Q.  In fact, for the government, for the United States, being

  18   in the United States, you didn't have that problem, correct?

  19   A.  That's correct.

  20   Q.  If you had been in Egypt, that might have been a problem?

  21   A.  Possibly, yes.

  22   Q.  And that's because, as you noted before, the Egyptians and

  23   the Sudanese do not get along, correct?

  24   A.  That's correct.

  25   Q.  And isn't it also a fact that part of the Egyptian --



                                                                615



   1   withdrawn.  Isn't it also a fact that the Egyptian government

   2   does not tolerate people who are very religiously Islamic and

   3   want to establish an Islamic government?

   4   A.  They won't tolerate anybody who have activities or had had

   5   activities in Peshawar.  Now, do they have any other views

   6   about other groups, I can't answer you that.

   7   Q.  When you say in Peshawar, you mean the mujahadeen?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And there were a lot of Egyptians who went to Peshawar and

  10   then ultimately Afghanistan who fought as mujahadeen and then

  11   tried to return to Egypt, correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And isn't it a fact that Egypt made it a crime for them to

  14   have been trained militarily in another country?

  15   A.  Later, yes.

  16   Q.  And that affected all of these mujahadeen, correct?

  17   A.  Of course.

  18   Q.  And it made them criminals in their own country, correct?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And it made it impossible for them to live in their own

  21   country?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And if they did try to live there, they would be

  24   imprisoned, correct?

  25   A.  I can't answer that.



                                                                616



   1   Q.  Isn't it a fact that thousands of persons are imprisoned

   2   in Egypt based on their Islamic and -- their activity in

   3   Islamic organizations?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.

   5            THE COURT:  One minute.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, 401 and competence.

   7            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   8            You want to establish his knowledge?

   9            MR. DRATEL:  Yes.

  10   BY MR. DRATEL:

  11   Q.  You grew up in Egypt, correct, and in Kuwait?

  12   A.  I lived in Egypt only for five years as a child and I grew

  13   up in Kuwait.

  14   Q.  But you went back to live in Egypt during the 1990s?

  15   A.  Right.

  16   Q.  When you were living in Egypt, was there not common

  17   knowledge that persons were imprisoned based on activity in

  18   Islamic organizations?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  With respect to the person who you mentioned as

  21   Al-'Owhali?

  22   A.  Nawawi.

  23   Q.  Nawawi, who served as your first officer on that last

  24   flight out of the airport in Khartoum, when you were

  25   interviewed by the government, isn't it a fact that --



                                                                617



   1   withdrawn.

   2            Didn't you tell the government during the interview

   3   with them that you did not know any connection between Mr. El

   4   Hage or Nawawi other than the fact that you had asked Mr. El

   5   Hage to find a co-pilot and that then Mr. Nawawi met you with

   6   the keys to the aircraft?

   7   A.  The answer to that, actually Wadia took care of the

   8   arrangements.

   9   Q.  Did you tell the government that during a previous

  10   interview?

  11   A.  I'm not sure, no.

  12   Q.  I show you what has been marked as 3503-2 --

  13            MR. DRATEL:  Just a moment, your Honor.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I have an objection to

  15   form.  Could I speak to Mr. Dratel for just a moment?

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            (Pause)

  18   BY MR. DRATEL:

  19   Q.  Isn't it a fact that Mr. El Hage did not tell you the name

  20   of the person who you would be meeting as a co-pilot?

  21   A.  It's a possibility.  You're asking me to recall a lot of

  22   details.  I'm sorry.

  23   Q.  And this is six, seven years ago, correct?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And also isn't it a fact that what you had done was ask


<P>
                                                                618



   1   him to arrange for you to have someone to assist you in flying

   2   the plane?

   3   A.  Yes, that's correct.

   4   Q.  And then you went to Khartoum and someone met you with the

   5   keys?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And this person turned out to be Nawawi?

   8   A.  Yes, but initially he did not have the keys.

   9   Q.  When you met with Usama Bin Laden in the Sudan on your

  10   first trip to the Sudan and after you had dinner and I guess

  11   it was the next day you met with him, correct?

  12   A.  No, the first night I arrived there early in the morning,

  13   had lunch with Wadia and dinner with Usama.

  14   Q.  But the next day was your meeting alone with Mr. Bin

  15   Laden?

  16   A.  Right.

  17   Q.  And at that meeting you expressed to him that you were not

  18   interested in Jihad but you were interested in purely

  19   business?

  20   A.  No, that was his indication when I actually told him about

  21   his previous actions in Peshawar and how much I opposed it.

  22   He indicated to me that this is strictly business.

  23   Q.  And he offered you the position?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  After that discussion?



                                                                619



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Now, after your last time flying the plane in the Sudan,

   3   you next met Mr. El Hage in 1998, correct?

   4   A.  That's correct.

   5   Q.  And you met in Texas?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And you were visiting your family?  You were visiting

   8   members of your family?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And you had spoken during your direct exam about your

  11   conversations with Moataz al Hallak about making sure that you

  12   could accomplish what you wanted to in the plane transaction

  13   and do it in an Islamically correct way?

  14   A.  That's correct.

  15   Q.  And it turned out there was a problem with that, correct?

  16   A.  At the time, no.  The problem came later.

  17   Q.  Yes.  And there was a disagreement between you and Mr. al

  18   Hallak as to whether or not you had followed all the rules you

  19   were supposed to?

  20   A.  Actually, I followed all the rules.  He's the one who

  21   defaulted on the rules.

  22   Q.  But there was an argument between you and Mr. Al Hallak?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And prior to that, he was your best friend, correct?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                620



   1   Q.  And part of Mr. El Hage seeing you that day, 1998, was an

   2   attempt to mediate the dispute between you and Mr. al Hallak,

   3   correct?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And he tried to serve as a way to get you two back

   6   together again as friends?

   7   A.  That's correct.

   8   Q.  And in addition, he also told you -- withdrawn.

   9            He was living in the United States at the time,

  10   Mr. El Hage, correct?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And this was in the early part of 1998?

  13   A.  It must have been the summertime because that's when I

  14   take the kids to visit the U.S.

  15   Q.  But it was before the bombings that occurred, correct?

  16   A.  It must have been after the bombings.

  17   Q.  Do you know for sure?

  18   A.  Not for sure, no.

  19   Q.  Well, he told you that his house in Kenya had been

  20   searched, correct, the year before?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And he told you that he had spoken with the FBI?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And he told you that your name had come up, correct?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                621



   1   Q.  And at that time he hadn't been arrested or anything,

   2   correct?

   3   A.  Say again, sir?

   4   Q.  Mr. El Hage had not been arrested?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  Or charged or anything?

   7   A.  No, he was only interviewed to what he indicated that he

   8   had been interviewed by the FBI.  There was no arrest.

   9   Q.  And so he was just informing you of the fact that he had

  10   been interviewed, his house had been searched, and that your

  11   name had come up?

  12   A.  No, actually he had indicated to me that they have seized

  13   few things from his house in Nairobi and the fact that

  14   definitely being friends, has name is there, his security

  15   system is there, my name might be there.

  16   Q.  The point of that is to let you know that you might be

  17   contacted by the government as well?

  18   A.  Well, actually that issue did not come.  The main issue

  19   was the reconciliation between me and Moataz and the fact that

  20   he was soliciting my advice on the status that he had with the

  21   FBI.

  22   Q.  But when he had discussions with you that day, nothing

  23   came up about anything illegal, correct?

  24   A.  Yes, absolutely.  Correct, nothing.

  25   Q.  There was nothing that you should be worried about in



                                                                622



   1   terms of anything that you had done, correct?

   2   A.  Yes, correct.

   3   Q.  And nothing to be worried about in anything that he had

   4   done, correct?

   5   A.  What I have indicated to him, if there is anything that he

   6   should be concerned about.  He said, no, absolutely.  I said,

   7   okay, be very forthcoming and very honest and clear with them

   8   and just carry it out until it's over.

   9   Q.  Just like you were?

  10   A.  Sorry?

  11   Q.  Just like you were with the government?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you.

  14            I have nothing further, your Honor.

  15            THE COURT:  Anything further of this witness?

  16            MR. RICCO:  No, your honor.

  17            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, I have one thing briefly.

  18            THE COURT:  Yes.  Mr. Cohn, on behalf of defendant

  19   Al-'Owhali.

  20   CROSS-EXAMINATION

  21   BY MR. COHN:

  22   Q.  Just to avoid confusion, sir, you mentioned the co-pilot's

  23   name was al Nawawi?

  24   A.  Nawawi.

  25   Q.  Nawawi.  How old was he at the time?



                                                                623



   1   A.  He must have been in the 25, 26 range.

   2   Q.  When was this?

   3   A.  1994, the end part of 1994.

  19   A.  No, sir.  There was only one small cupboard which was

  20   there and there were four beds, bunkers like.

  21   Q.  And where were you during the course of this trip?

  22   A.  We were, I was sleeping on the top bed, and he was

  23   sleeping on the next top bed, too.  We were together like on

  24   top.

  25   Q.  When you say "he," who are you referring to?



                                                                642



   1   A.  Mr. Jalal.

   2   Q.  And why don't you describe for the jury what happened on

   3   the ferry that day?

   4   A.  Well, from where we were going the ship was not very good.

   5   Actually, it was moving on the sidewards, not in a straight

   6   way, the way ships ferry should be, because one of the water

   7   tank under the ship, which I came to find out later on, was

   8   not working, so it had no water it, so to keep the ship on the

   9   balance, because moving on the sidewards.

  10            And when we reached almost in Mwanza, it was early in

  11   the morning around 7 o'clock, saw outside the window, and I

  12   was, we were both asleep on the, he was in his bed and I was

  13   on my bed and five others they were on the bottom under

  14   sleeping, and all of a sudden the ship went first on the side

  15   of the left-hand side of the ship.  It tilted a bit more, till

  16   I had to shout for Mr. Jalal who is next to me.  When he woke

  17   up he was asleep, too, and he told me that --

  18            (Pause)

  19   Q.  Okay, Mr. Juma, continue.

  20   A.  And he told me that, I shouted, Brother Jalal, and he say

  21   to me that, don't worry.  Go back to sleep.  Allah is with us.

  22   And I went back to sleep again.  Within that moment only the

  23   ship went again on the right-hand side from this side to the

  24   other side, and once he started going that way, it went

  25   straight.



                                                                643



   1            We started everybody wanted to come out, and there

   2   was a lot of screams and people were screaming, could not come

   3   out; things were falling inside, and everybody wanted to,

   4   there was only one way to come out and I managed to come out

   5   on the corridor.  And I got hold of Mr. Jalal's hand and I

   6   pull him out, because the ship had already gone on the side

   7   way, so the door had become like a roof, because it was

   8   slipping on the side, and --

   9   Q.  The door had become the roof of the passenger compartment?

  10   A.  Yes, sir.

  11   Q.  And where were you in relationship to the door?

  12   A.  I was on top of the door.  This means I was on the

  13   corridor but it was, this is the door, and once it comes like

  14   this I was on the other side here.

  15   Q.  And where was Jalal?

  16   A.  He was inside the compartment and I pulled him out halfway

  17   he came, he came out, but all of a sudden what he was holding

  18   was door, he was holding the door, and the door broke from the

  19   hinges and he fell back in.

  20            As soon as he fell in, he fell on those other people

  21   who were inside there. I don't know how he fell in, because

  22   maybe some people tried to pull him out because they wanted to

  23   come out, too, and he was up, when he fell in.  By the time

  24   when he fell in the water had already started coming from the

  25   window because the window was open from the boat underneath.



                                                                644



   1            And I tried to stick my hand again to pull him out,

   2   and the water came in through the corridor now.  It was like

   3   full force of water came in.  And I just jumped to the next

   4   door which was closed, and I held the lock of that door.  The

   5   water was pushing me inwards, and I had only single breath to

   6   go out now for the breath.  So I went all the way for those

   7   things, other compartments crossing all those things and to

   8   the main gate, and then I came out the other side, which by

   9   the time I came out the ship had already gone about half of it

  10   is already under the water from the sidewards, and I climbed

  11   up on top.

  12            Now I was on the side of the ship, and it was going

  13   this way, from straight it was going upside down, and I was

  14   walking on top and climbing up until I reached on the belly of

  15   the ferry.

  16   Q.  So you were standing eventually on the top of what was the

  17   bottom hull of the ferry?

  18   A.  Of the bottom hull of the ship.

  19   Q.  What did you do after that?

  20   A.  Well, after that, there were many people, there were many

  21   people who were trying to scream, and I saw people dying

  22   there, because there were quite a lot of people they were not

  23   in their compartment cabins, they were sleeping out on the

  24   corridor doors.  Other people were coming out, and I, within

  25   few minutes I saw many bodies floating out there, and I said



                                                                645



   1   that this ship might sink because it has already overturned

   2   and if it sinks because I saw many people fighting for their

   3   life and holding each other, and they took others, the one who

   4   could swim, they drowned.  So I said, if it goes underwater

   5   the ship sinks, then these people who are on top we were about

   6   twenty to thirty people on that belly of the ship, they might

   7   come to catch me, hold of me, too, so I took off my clothes

   8   and I dived from the ship.  I swam for about five hundred

   9   meters, but it was around the area, because I could not go the

  10   other side of the land, as it was very far from me, it was

  11   about nine kilometers, and nearest was about not, not near,

  12   less than about two kilometers, three kilometers away from the

  13   ship where it sank.

  14            So I what I said then, let me go back near where I

  15   can get the floater and hold the floater.  There were about

  16   five to six floaters only around there.  So we were holding

  17   about ten people in that floater.

  18   Q.  And were you eventually rescued?

  19   A.  Yes, after two hours the first ship came to rescue us.

  20   Q.  And did the ferry eventually sink entirely?

  21   A.  Not at that time, but when it was just floating upside

  22   down and there were some people who were alive at that time,

  23   and well, we were taken -- we were on the other ship which

  24   rescued us and some police officers came there, and they saw

  25   somebody knocking at the door, and they commanded that, okay,



                                                                646



   1   make hole here to take out this person, and most of the people

   2   who were there they said that, if you take out this the air

   3   bubble once this comes out the ship will sink, and why don't

   4   you like pull the ship on the side, because since its

   5   floating?  But, no, they say, just cut the hole there and save

   6   the person who is knocking from inside there.  As soon as they

   7   cut the hole with the gas, and the whole air came out, they

   8   saved only one person from there already.  The ship all went

   9   down.

  10   Q.  Do you know about how deep the water was at that point?

  11   A.  One hundred ten feet.

  12   Q.  Now, after you were rescued where did they bring you?

  13   A.  I went first to the hospital for checkup.  They said no,

  14   you're not supposed to go home.  I said that, I am very fine,

  15   I can go home, but, no, they took me to hospital for checkup.

  16   Q.  And that was back in Mwanza?

  17   A.  Mwanza, yes, sir.

  18   Q.  Do you know about how many people died in this ferry

  19   accident?

  20   A.  Not less than one thousand, sir, 'cause we were only

  21   hundred fourteen people who survived.

  22   Q.  When you got back to Mwanza did you do anything to notify

  23   anyone about what happened to you and to Jalal?

  24   A.  Yes, I told my brothers and sisters that, look, I am sure

  25   a hundred and one percent sure that Mr. Jalal could not make



                                                                647



   1   it and we better notify to the family member or to any friend

   2   or any relative of Mr. Jalal.  So I told that to my sister

   3   Tahera.

   4   Q.  And what happened after you asked your sister Tahera to

   5   notify Jalal's friends or family about the ferry accident?

   6   A.  Well, she said that I think she had a phone number of

   7   somebody, and she called and after three days a friend of

   8   Mr. Jalal came to Mwanza, three, four days later.

   9   Q.  And who was the friend of Jalal that came to Mwanza three

  10   or fur days later?

  11   A.  It was Fazhul.

  12   Q.  And what did Fazhul look like?

  13   A.  He was a short, a bit short guy, five foot something, some

  14   inches, dark with a bit hair, and could speak broken Swahili

  15   and broken English.

  16   Q.  And how long did Fazhul stay in Mwanza?

  17   A.  For about a month.

  18   Q.  And where did he stay while he was in Mwanza?

  19   A.  He stayed in my house, in my sister's house.

  20   Q.  And how frequently did you see him while he was down there

  21   for that month?

  22   A.  I saw from, because we were seeing each other, we were

  23   going together to the port to try and great Mr. Jalal's body.

  24   Q.  So you and Fazhul would go to the port to try to get to

  25   identify Jalal's body?



                                                                648



   1   A.  Yes, sir.

   2   Q.  And what would you do in order to do that?

   3   A.  Well, he was most of the time he was with my younger

   4   brother Sikander.

   5   Q.  S-I-K-A-N-D-E-R?

   6   A.  Yes, sir.  Most of the time he was with him because had he

   7   they could manage to go to the accident site by other boats

   8   which were rescuing the body, recovering the bodies.

   9   Q.  What was happening at the port during this month that

  10   Fazhul was down?

  11   A.  It was just we were just getting some other bodies of

  12   other people and try to notify this is the one, but we did not

  13   find anybody, anybody of Mr. Jalal.  We did not find Jalal's

  14   body.

  15   Q.  Did Fazhul tell you where he had come from to come to

  16   Mwanza?

  17   A.  From Nairobi.

  18   Q.  And did Fazhul tell you how he knew Jalal?

  19   A.  Not I can remember.

  20   Q.  Did Fazhul tell you what he was doing in Nairobi?

  21   A.  No.

  22   Q.  And, once again, did you ever find Jalal's body?

  23   A.  No, sir.

  24   Q.  Now, did there come a time when you came into possession

  25   of a videotape of the aftermath of this ferry accident?

   1   A.  Yes, sir.  There was one local video librarian there, he

   2   shot movies which were showing about the dead bodies which

   3   were coming there, and about the accident and all the incident

   4   which happened there, and he sold those cassettes, which I

   3            MR. DRATEL:  If I may have a second, your Honor.

   4            THE COURT:  All right.

   5            (Pause)

   6            MR. DRATEL:  Just to save time, your Honor, I think

   7   we have an agreement with the government that the reports of

   8   the interview do not contain any information about the

   9   letters.

  10            THE COURT:  Very well.

  11            MR. DRATEL:  The dates of the interviews were -- the

  12   first one is October 7, 1998, second one is January 30, 1999.

  13   Q.  And does it sound correct that you provided the government

  14   the letter perhaps -- was it last year, the year 2000, when

  15   you gave the government the letter?

  16   A.  I can't remember, sir.

  17   Q.  June 2000, does that sound correct?

  18            I just show you what's marked 3502-3.  I just ask you

  19   to read that paragraph to yourself.

  20   A.  Yes, sir.

  21   Q.  Does that refresh your recollection that you gave the

  22   government the letter in June of 2000?

  23   A.  Yes, sir.

  24   Q.  Thank you.

  25            When you left the letter out of those two interviews,



                                                                671



   1   you didn't do that on purpose, did you?  You didn't

   2   deliberately lie to the government, correct?  You didn't

   3   lie --

   4            MR. BUTLER:  Objection, your Honor.

   5            THE COURT:  Overruled.

   6   BY MR. DRATEL:

   7   Q.  You didn't deliberately leave the letter out, correct?

   8   A.  I didn't deliberately?

   9   Q.  Did you just forget about the letter during those

  10   interviews?  You didn't remember the letter; isn't that

  11   correct?

  12   A.  I did remember.  I think I had mentioned that I had got a

  13   letter, but I did not have it with me.  But I had mentioned to

  14   them that once I find that letter, I will bring it to you.

  15   Q.  When you -- in your fist two interviews with the

  16   government, you never spoke about the conversation that you

  17   had about repaying the money during the first trip that Wadia

  18   took; isn't that correct?

  19   A.  I did.  I did.

  20   Q.  Well, I'll show you what's marked as 3502-1 and ask you to

  21   read these two paragraphs.  You can read the whole page if you

  22   like, but those two paragraphs read to yourself, please.

  23            MR. BUTLER:  Which page?

  24            MR. DRATEL:  What page is that, page 4?

  25            THE WITNESS:  Page 4.



                                                                672



   1            (Pause)

   2            THE COURT:  What is the question?

   3   BY MR. DRATEL:

   4   Q.  Okay, the question is:  There's nothing there about the

   5   conversation about repaying the money or the loan itself the

   6   first time that Wadia comes to see you, correct?

   7            MR. BUTLER:  Objection to form, your Honor.

   8   A.  Yes, sir.

   9   Q.  Is it possible that you had just left it out and you

  10   forgot it, correct?

  11            MR. BUTLER:  Your Honor, objection.  The document is

  12   not in evidence.

  13            THE COURT:  Yes.  Ask the witness what his

  14   recollection is.  You can use the document to refresh his

  15   recollection, but that's the extent of it.

  16   BY MR. DRATEL:

  17   Q.  Does that refresh your recollection that perhaps you left

  18   it out?

  19   A.  I left out what, sir?

  20   Q.  The first conversation, the first time Wadia comes to see

  21   you, right at the time of the accident, that you left out the

  22   discussion of the loan and all that, that you possibly forgot

  23   it?

  24            THE COURT:  You forgot to tell the FBI?

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Yes.



                                                                673



   1            THE COURT:  In the description of this meeting?

   2   A.  No, sir.  I remember I had discussed, I had told them that

   3   he asked me about the money.

   4            THE COURT:  Let's move on.

   5            MR. DRATEL:  Yes.

   6   Q.  The 9 million in Tanzanian shillings, do you know how much

   7   that would be in U.S. dollars at the time?

   8   A.  Somewhere around --

   9   Q.  Would it be $10,000?

  10   A.  18,000.

  11   Q.  Wasn't the exchange rate about 6.15?

  12   A.  About that much, yes, sir.

  13   Q.  And when you spoke to Mr. Adel Habib about the money, he

  14   told you that it was from friends in Mombasa, correct?

  15   A.  Yes, sir.

  16   Q.  And Mr. Karama had a Khost Swahili accent by your

  17   judgment?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And Mombasa is on the Khost of Kenya?

  20   A.  Yes, sir.

  21   Q.  And you never heard anything from anybody else about this

  22   after the second time Mr. Wadia came to see you, correct, in

  23   terms of repayment of any money?

  24   A.  The second time?

  25   Q.  Yes, after you signed the note?



                                                                674



   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  You never heard anything else about this?

   3   A.  No.

   4   Q.  And you never repaid any money?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  Or were in contact with anyone?

   7   A.  Yes, sir.

   8            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you.  Nothing further, your Honor.

   9            THE COURT:  Redirect?

  10            MR. BUTLER:  Briefly, your Honor.

  11   REDIRECT EXAMINATION

  12   BY MR. BUTLER:

  13   Q.  Mr. Juma, Mr. Dratel asked you on cross-examination about

  14   whether your brother Sikander had told you if he was nervous

  15   about having signed a lease to this property at 43 Runda

  16   Estates, correct?

  17            MR. DRATEL:  Objection, your Honor.  Objection,

  18   that's not the question.  It was a mischaracterization.

  19            THE COURT:  Well, the jury's recollection will

  20   control.  You may answer the question.

  21   Q.  Mr. Juma, did your brother Sikander tell you that the same

  22   Fazhul who stayed at the hotel with Wadia after Jalal drowned

  23   was the person who asked him to rent the place at 43 Runda

  24   Estates where the Nairobi bomb was built?

  25   A.  Yes, sir.



                                                                675



   1            MR. BUTLER:  No further questions, your Honor.

   2            THE COURT:  Very well.

   3   RECROSS-EXAMINATION

   4   BY MR. DRATEL:

   5   Q.  And he rented that about over two years after the ferry

   6   accident, correct, the bombing, more than two years after the

   7   ferry accident?

   8   A.  Yes, sir.

   9            MR. DRATEL:  Nothing further.

  10            THE COURT:  Thank you, sir.  You may step down.

  11            (Witness excused)

  12            THE COURT:  What's the next order of business?

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I believe there was a

  14   stipulation as to an exhibit Mr. Karas will be addressing.

  15            THE COURT:  All right.

  16            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, if I may hand up the

  17   stipulation?

  18            THE COURT:  Yes.  The stipulation has been marked

  19   Government Exhibit 31, which is signed by counsel for all the

  20   defendants, which reads:  "It is stipulated and agreed that

  21   Government Exhibit 1600 is a copy of a declaration of Jihad

  22   issued in Usama Bin Laden's name on August 23, 1996.

  23   Government Exhibit 1600-T is a fair and accurate translation

  24   of the declaration."

  25            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, at this time we would like to



                                                                676



   1   read the translation to the jury.

   2            THE COURT:  Are you also going to give them copies of

   3   it while you read?

   4            MR. KARAS:  We are.

   5            MR. RUHNKE:  Before that happens, could we be heard

   6   on that, just before that happens?  Maybe we can take our

   7   afternoon break and discuss it briefly, before they start

   8   reading this.

   9            THE COURT:  We have just taken a break.  I will see

  10   you and the reporter -- did we not take a break?  No?  We'll

  11   take a break.  We'll take a break.  We can't have too many

  12   breaks.

  13            (Recess)

  14            THE COURT:  I have to tell you I'm totally confused

  15   on taking breaks because I thought there was a whole issue

  16   being made about breaks to enable the defendants to observe

  17   their religious practices, and so I have been taking a break

  18   shortly after noon and then discover that although everybody

  19   else took a break, the defendants chose to remain in the

  20   courtroom, so I just don't understand.

  21            In any event, Mr. Ruhnke, what is your problem?

  22            MR. RUHNKE:  Judge, the government is about to, I

  23   guess, simply read Government Exhibit 1600 in evidence.

  24            THE COURT:  Yes.

  25            MR. RUHNKE:  There are references in 1600-T, and they



                                                                677



   1   will have a chance to read these, to the explosions at Riyadh

   2   and Khobar at page 6.  There are references on page 34 to the

   3   bombing in Lebanon, I assume, because it refers to the Riyadh,

   4   Khobar bombing in Beirut, talking about the corpses of 241

   5   soldiers, most of whom were marines.  There is a reference on

   6   page 35 to the dead pilot who is dragged throughout the

   7   streets of Mogadishu, and I think some of this has to be

   8   redacted, I suggest, before it goes to the jury.

   9            THE COURT:  I'm confused.  Why did you sign the

  10   stipulation?

  11            MR. RUHNKE:  It's an accurate translation, your

  12   Honor.  It is an accurate translation.  We're stipulating that

  13   it is an accurate translation.

  14            THE COURT:  All right.

  15            MR. KARAS:  Judge, the document as a whole is a

  16   declaration of Jihad that was issued in Bin Laden's name.

  17            THE COURT:  Yes.

  18            MR. KARAS:  The document, first of all, it's a

  19   co-conspirator statement and lays out his mind-set and where

  20   it is that he thinks that the organization or people who

  21   are --

  22            THE COURT:  May I have a copy of it, please?

  23            MR. KARAS:  You may, Judge.  I'm sorry.

  24            He is not taking credit for what happened in Riyadh

  25   or Khobar.  What he's doing is he is praising it, and it goes



                                                                678



   1   to his mind-set and the mind-set that he wants his followers

   2   to undertake, which is to attack the Americans for their

   3   presence in the Saudi Gulf.

   4            THE COURT:  You want me to tell the jury that this

   5   document, which has been stipulated to as being an accurate

   6   translation and which may be received in evidence, is a

   7   statement made by Usama Bin Laden and is to be understood by

   8   the jury to be a statement made by him?

   9            MR. RUHNKE:  Well, your Honor, that's not why the

  10   government is offering it.  That's --

  11            THE COURT:  Yes, it is.

  12            MR. RUHNKE:  That's sort of circular.  They are

  13   offering it as a declaration of a co-conspirator, admissible

  14   as the declaration of every person seated at counsel table.

  15            THE COURT:  Do you want me to tell them that?

  16            MR. RUHNKE:  No, sir.  I want, under Rule 403, I

  17   would like the references to the Khobar bombing, the Riyadh

  18   bombing, the dragging of the dead body through the streets of

  19   Mogadishu and the reference to the bombing of the marine

  20   barracks in Beirut excised.

  21            MR. KARAS:  Judge, this is --

  22            THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is what he said.  Now,

  23   the fact that he said it itself has a relevance.

  24            All right, do people want to take a recess?  We will

  25   take a recess.



                                                                679



   1            MR. DRATEL:  Yes.

   2            THE COURT:  We'll take a five-minute recess.

   3            This is going to be the prayer recess.  We'll recess

   4   again at 4:30.

   5            MR. BAUGH:  Okay.

   6            MR. COHN:  Next one is at 5:30, which is beyond our

   7   time table.

   8            THE COURT:  I have another matter at 4:30.  So it's

   9   certainly beyond it.

  10            (Recess)

  11            THE COURT:  I just want to put one other thing on the

  12   record apropos to the last application and the Court's ruling.

  13   The fact that the government intended to read this 1600T in

  14   evidence has long been known to everyone.  The stipulation

  15   that was entered into is signed by everyone.  If there is in

  16   the future any application to redact an exhibit, as I thought

  17   I had made clear many times in the past, that application is

  18   to be made at the earliest possible opportunity, not at the

  19   moment when it's about to be read or presented to the jury.

  20            As soon as the defendants are ready, we'll resume.

  21            (Recess)

  22            THE COURT:  The first stipulation did not have an

  23   exhibit number.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, because it was in poor form, I

  25   was going to retype it and give it an exhibit number tomorrow.



                                                                680



   1   It will be number 30.

   2            THE COURT:  We are ready to bring in the jury?  Who

   3   is going to read it?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Mr. Karas.

   5            (Jury present)

   6            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, just before the

   7   recess, I read to you a stipulation of the parties to the

   8   effect that Government Exhibit 1600T is a fair and accurate

   9   translation of a declaration of Jihad issued in Usama Bin

  10   Laden's name on August 23, 1996.  I understand the government

  11   is now going to read it.  You have a copy of it on your seat.

  12   You may, if you wish, read along.  If you care to listen and

  13   not read, you may do that.  Whatever you feel most comfortable

  14   with.

  15            You may proceed.

  16            MR. KARAS:  Thank you, your Honor.  Also, your Honor,

  17   what we would like to do is show Exhibit 1600, which is the

  18   Arab original on the screens.

  19            THE COURT:  Very well.

  20            (Exhibit 1600T read)

  21            THE COURT:  Suppose we pick it up from there

  22   tomorrow.

  23            MR. KARAS:  Yes.

  24            THE COURT:  You can take this with you and leave it

  25   in the jury room.  We'll adjourn until 10 a.m. tomorrow.



                                                                681



   1            (Jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  There is something somebody wants to take

   3   up with me?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  I can do it in a letter over night.

   5   I wanted to raise an issue with regard to 3500 material.  I

   6   handed out an article -- I'm concerned more about the process

   7   than substance -- an article appearing in today's paper.  It

   8   indicated that -- the reporter indicated the content of an

   9   item of 3500 material that was not put in evidence.

  10            THE COURT:  This is an article appearing in the --

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  I believe it's the Post or Newsday.

  12            THE COURT:  Newsday.  And the concern is this portion

  13   of this article that --

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, your Honor, and it's not the

  15   concern about that particular document discussed or shown to

  16   the press, it's a concern in the future that we give over 3500

  17   material with the understanding that it is not handed out as a

  18   public exhibit or discussed or shown to the media unless in

  19   the event that it becomes a public exhibit, which is something

  20   we have an opportunity to be heard about.  And that has guided

  21   us in turning over much material that we otherwise would not

  22   turn over.

  23            THE COURT:  Anybody have any quarrel with that?

  24            MR. RUHNKE:  No.

  25            THE COURT:  Mr. Dratel, do you have any problem with



                                                                682



   1   that?

   2            MR. DRATEL:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

   3            THE COURT:  Do you have any problem with that?

   4            MR. DRATEL:  No, your Honor.

   5            THE COURT:  Mr. Ruhnke?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  I just want to make a record and

   7   hopefully it won't happen again.

   8            MR. RUHNKE:  One thing before we adjourn, I'm sorry.

   9            THE COURT:  Yes.

  10            MR. RUHNKE:  We are now in the middle of reading

  11   Government Exhibit 1600T.  We have not gotten to the

  12   reference -- we've gotten a couple of references to Khobar and

  13   Riyadh.  We have not gotten to the references to the bombing

  14   in Beirut or to the dragging of the dead American pilot

  15   through the streets of Mogadishu, which I submit is probably

  16   the only memorable thing for most people to come out of the

  17   action in Somalia.  It can be easily redacted overnight, and I

  18   renew my objection and ask the government to redact it

  19   overnight on a 403 basis, dangerously prejudicial.  Our

  20   clients are not charged with that.  The government has --

  21            THE COURT:  Your clients are charged.  Your clients

  22   are charged with being members of a conspiracy of which Bin

  23   Laden is the leader of, who set the goals and the criteria.

  24            MR. RUHNKE:  Yes, sir, and we have had discussions

  25   before about whether the government was going to move away



                                                                683



   1   from its proof of what occurred in Somalia because it involved

   2   none of the defendants on trial, it involved references only

   3   to people who were trained by people who were trained by al

   4   Qaeda, and we are now having the reference right in the jury's

   5   face.  And I made my objection.  If your Honor thought it was

   6   late, we got the revised translation a couple of days ago.  We

   7   had a stipulation which we didn't think we were going to get

   8   to until tomorrow.

   9            THE COURT:  What is the government's position?

  10            MR. KARAS:  Judge, what Bin Laden is doing here is

  11   explaining the mind-set of himself and what he wants the

  12   mind-set of his followers to be.  He is praising the people

  13   who conducted these other operations, but he is not saying

  14   that either he or his group took credit for it.  We're not

  15   charging these defendants with participation in Riyadh or

  16   Khobar, we certainly are not charging them with this

  17   participation in the Beirut bombing in 1983, but the document

  18   goes directly to the mind-set of this group and explains

  19   really the theme of Bin Laden's organization.

  20            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  21            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor?

  22            THE COURT:  Yes.

  23            MR. WILFORD:  Given Mr. Karas's position, the Court's

  24   denial of Mr. Ruhnke's objection, would the Court give an

  25   instruction to the jury along the lines of Mr. Karas's



                                                                684



   1   statement?

   2            THE COURT:  Which says?  Tell me again what you want

   3   me to say.  Some of your co-counsel are shaking their head

   4   "no."

   5            MR. COHN:  One is, can we consider that until

   6   tomorrow morning and talk about it as a group?

   7            MR. WILFORD:  No problem.

   8            MR. COHN:  Thank you.

   9            THE COURT:  We'll take it up at 9:45 tomorrow

  10   morning.

  11            MR. WILFORD:  Thank you.

  12            THE COURT:  All right.

  13            (Adjourned to 9:45 a.m. on February 15, 2001)
