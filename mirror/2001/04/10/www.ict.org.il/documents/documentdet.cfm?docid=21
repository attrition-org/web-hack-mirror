<P><center><i>Full Text of the verdict in the Ocalan trial, as translated by the BBC Monitoring Division from Turkish TRT Television</i></center>
<p><P>"I am reading out the decision
of the court. I am inviting you to stand while you listen to the paragraph
on the verdict.
<p>"As a result of this trial,
our court has sentenced suspect Abdullah Ocalan to death in accordance
with Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code [TCK] as befitting his action,
because we have determined that he undertook actions aimed at separating
a portion of the territories that are under the sovereignty of the state
from the administration of the state, by guiding and administering the
armed terrorist organization PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party], which he established
by means of the decisions he made and the commands and instructions he
issued.
<p>In view of the intensity
and continuity of the suspect's actions and the fact that thousands of
innocent people - regardless of whether they were infants, children, women
or elderly - were killed; because hundreds of the crimes that were committed
as a vehicle for the intended crime require the death penalty; because
the actions constitute a serious, close and great danger to the country;
and in order to uphold criminal justice and comply with the rules of justice
and propriety, the court has unanimously decided
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1>That there is no room for the
application of Article 59 of the TCK with regard to the suspect</font>
</li>

<li>
<font size=-1>That the suspect be forever
banned from public service in accordance with Article 31 of the TCK</font></font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>That the suspect be kept in
detention throughout the criminal process in accordance with Article 33
of the TCK</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>That the time spent by the
suspect in detention during the course of the trial process be reduced
from his sentence and that he remain under arrest in accordance with Article
40 of the TCK</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>That his personal belongings
- namely, one Zenith watch, a glass case, a leather belt, Rayban sunglasses,
and a tie - be returned to him</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>That the intervenors' right
to compensation be preserved</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>That according to the official
legal fees in effect at the time, the suspect pay 56,350,000 Turkish lira
each to the lawyers representing the intervenors</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>And that the decision be announced
to the intervenors and their representatives who are not in attendance
via TRT in accordance with Article 21 of Law 2845.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=-1>The decision is subject to
appeal by both sides.</font>
<p>Thank you to all.
