<P><center><i>Turkey's Specific Demands from Syria</i></center>
<p>
&nbsp;In order to normalize our relations, we expect Syria to comply with
the basic norms and principles of international relations. In this regard,
the following specific demands should be met:

<P>Given the fact that turkish-Syrian relations were seriously damaged
by Syrian support for terrorism, we want Syria to accept formally its obligations
and renounce its previous stand on this matter. These obligations should
include a formal commitment not to give terrorists support, sanctuary,
and financial assistance. Syria should also prosecute PKK perpetrators
and extradite to Turkey the chief of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan and his collaborators.

<P>Within this framework, Syria should not:
<UL>
<LI>
Permit camps for terrorist training to operate in territories under its
control,</LI>

<LI>
Provide weapons, logistic materials to the PKK,</LI>

<LI>
Provide fraud identification documents to PKK members,</LI>

<LI>
Help terrorists in obtaining legal passage and infiltration into Turkey,</LI>

<LI>
Permit the propaganda activities of the terrorist organization,</LI>

<LI>
Allow the PKK to operate in accommodations in its territory,</LI>

<LI>
Facilitate the passages of terrorists from third countries (Europe, Greece,
Southern Cyprus, Iran, Libya, Armenia) to northern Iraq and Turkey.</LI>
</UL>
Syria should provide:
<UL>
<LI>
Cooperation in all activities aimed at fighting terrorism.</LI>

<LI>
Abstention from inciting other countries which are members of the Arab
League against Turkey.</LI>
</UL>
In light of the above, unless Syria refrains from these acts immediately,
with all the consequences, Turkey reserves the right to exercise her inherent
right of self-defense, and under all circumstances to demand just compensation
for the loss of life and property. Indeed, these views were transmitted
to Syria through diplomatic channels on 23 January 1996. However, our warnings
have fallen on deaf ears.
