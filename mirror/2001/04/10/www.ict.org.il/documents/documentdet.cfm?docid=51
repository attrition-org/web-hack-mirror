   1            (Trial resumed)

   2            THE COURT:  Are there any matters that require the

   3   court's attention before bringing the witness and the jury?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  One very brief matter, on which

   5   there is agreement.  Mr. Schmidt wanted a picture of the

   6   witness al-Fadl to use to cross-examine this witness.  I have

   7   provided him one on the understanding that if it is offered as

   8   an exhibit it will be a sealed exhibit so his picture is not

   9   in the public domain.

  10            THE COURT:  Very well.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  I would also wish to put in this

  12   transcript, which will take two minutes, and then we will be

  13   ready for cross-examination.

  14            THE COURT:  Very well.  Bring in the witness and

  15   bring in the jury.

  16    L'HOUSSAINE KHERCHTOU, resumed.

  18            THE COURT:  Good morning.

  19            JURORS:  Good morning.

  20            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald.

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you, your Honor.

   1   DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued)

   2   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   3   Q.  Mr. Kherchtou, I have placed before you two transcripts,

   4   marked 201A-T and 217B-T.

   5   A.  Yes, sir.

   6   Q.  Have you reviewed those transcripts and translations and

   7   compared them with tape recordings that you listened to at the

   8   same time?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Are those two transcripts fair and accurate

  11   transcriptions, in other words, writings, of what was said in

  12   the phone conversations, including translations from Arabic to

  13   English?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Were the voices as identified on the transcripts, are

  16   those voices accurately identified as to who is speaking?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you, your Honor.  I have

  19   nothing further.

  20            THE COURT:  Very well.  We will proceed with

  21   cross-examination.  Mr. Schmidt.

  22   CROSS-EXAMINATION

  23   BY MR. SCHMIDT:

  24   Q.  Good morning, Mr. Kherchtou.  Is that how you pronounce

  25   your name?



                                                                1350

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.  Good morning.

   2   Q.  What year was it that you first went to Afghanistan?

   3   A.  It was in 1991.

   4   Q.  And you remained in Afghanistan until some point in 1993,

   5   is that correct?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Did you travel outside of Afghanistan or Pakistan during

   8   the period from 1991 to 1993 when you left ultimately to go to

   9   Nairobi?

  10   A.  Yes, I went to Saudi Arabia.

  11   Q.  Was that for a hajj?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Did you go with other members of the group on the hajj?

  14   A.  Well, I went by myself but there was a guy, he wasn't from

  15   al Qaeda.  His name was Dr. Montessur.  He was an Egyptian.

  16   Q.  Was he a member of an Egyptian group?

  17   A.  No, he was a doctor working with al Qaeda guesthouse.

  18   Q.  He was a doctor, a medical doctor from Egypt?

  19   A.  Yes, he is a medical doctor, yes.

  20   Q.  He was treating members of al Qaeda and other groups in

  21   Afghanistan?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  Were there many people in Afghanistan who were not members

  24   of al Qaeda?

  25   A.  Yes, many.



                                                                1351

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Many of these people working in roles, like as doctors,

   2   nurse, and helpers?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  You told us that when you arrived in Pakistan, I think it

   5   was, at one of the guesthouses, your papers, your documents,

   6   your travel documents, passport, were taken from you; is that

   7   correct?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  It was your understanding that was for safekeeping?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Because you were ultimately going to go into Afghanistan

  12   and participate in a war, at the time against the Afghani

  13   Communists, right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  After you left Afghanistan and Pakistan, were your papers

  16   returned to you?

  17   A.  At what time you are talking about?

  18   Q.  Excuse me?

  19   A.  They were given to me when I moved from Bait al Ansar to

  20   Bait al Salaam.  And they were given to me again at the end

  21   when I was traveling.

  22   Q.  When you were at the front or in the camps, did you get

  23   regular time off to visit your wife?

  24   A.  Yes, in the camp, yes.

  25   Q.  Was that important to you, to be able to spend time with



                                                                1352

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   your wife periodically?

   2   A.  Yes, I think so.

   3   Q.  Is that a religious duty?

   4   A.  It is.

   5   Q.  In some point in 19 -- withdrawn.

   6            When you were in Afghanistan, did you meet people who

   7   had come to Afghanistan to assist the Afghanis in the early or

   8   mid-1980's?

   9   A.  I met many people but I don't know exactly when they came

  10   there.

  11   Q.  Did it become known to you that some of the people -- he's

  12   been here or he's come back from 1983 or he's been here from

  13   the very beginning, something of that nature?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  There were a number of people, I am sure a minority, who

  16   fit that description, is that right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  People who did come early on in the Afghan freedom battle

  19   against the Russians were treated with a little bit more

  20   respect because they came so early on.

  21   A.  Yes, you are right.

  22   Q.  For somebody to do that, that alone would give a degree of

  23   trust to that person if that person came in the early 1980's

  24   and stayed the whole time, or came back and forth to help the

  25   cause, is that right?



                                                                1353

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Before you went to Nairobi did you make a stop in the

   3   Sudan?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  Did your wife travel from Pakistan to the Sudan before you

   6   went to Nairobi or after you went to Nairobi?

   7   A.  What happened is, I went after my wife in pilgrimage in

   8   Saudi Arabia.  Then from Saudi Arabia I went back to Pakistan.

   9   She traveled from Saudi Arabia to Sudan.  Then when I went

  10   back to Kenya, I had 20 days to wait for the immigration

  11   permit to be issued.  Then I went to Sudan and found my wife

  12   already there.

  13   Q.  So first you actually physically went to Kenya?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And filed papers in Kenya?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  How many days were you there before you went to the Sudan?

  18   A.  I don't remember.  Probably a week.

  19   Q.  Do you recall the first time that you went to Nairobi, is

  20   it fair to say that that was approximately October of 1993?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  It was your understanding that you were going to Kenya to

  23   learn to be a pilot, is that right?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  You had no objections to that because that's a good skill



                                                                1354

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   to learn, isn't it?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Your understanding was that Mr. Bin Laden wanted you to be

   4   available to not only fly an airplane if he wanted to travel

   5   but also for crop dusting for the farming companies, is that

   6   right?

   7   A.  I didn't get your question, please.

   8   Q.  It was your understanding that once you became a pilot you

   9   would be doing flying, perhaps Mr. Bin Laden around?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And doing crop dusting for the farming companies.

  12   A.  Excuse me.  Your microphone --

  13   Q.  You would be doing crop dusting for the farms owned by

  14   Mr. Bin Laden and his companies, is that right?

  15   A.  The crop dusting came very later after that, when we want

  16   back to Sudan, they wanted to have somebody who has already

  17   the license and he can fly crop dusting.

  18   Q.  So when you first came to Nairobi, it was just to fly

  19   Mr. Bin Laden's personal plane, but then later on it was

  20   expanded to include crop dusting of the farms.

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  As you told us, there was a religious obligation for you

  23   to regularly visit with your wife, is that correct?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And also, by the time that your wife was in the Sudan did



                                                                1355

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   you have any children?

   2   A.  Yes, I had one, yes.

   3   Q.  It was also a religious obligation to spend time with your

   4   children as well.

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And you took that quite seriously, didn't you?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  So after spending approximately two months in Nairobi

   9   studying, you went back and spent a month in the Sudan with

  10   your family.  Would that be accurate?

  11   A.  No, it is not accurate.  It wasn't like that.  Normally,

  12   if you talk about religious, if you stay somewhere far from

  13   your wife, you should stay at least four months, then you go

  14   back to visit her.  But in Nairobi when I was there, it wasn't

  15   exactly two months and then another month in Sudan.  Probably

  16   if I stayed three months I can get two weeks or three weeks I

  17   go to Sudan, and so on.

  18   Q.  This was quite a while ago, right?

  19   A.  Excuse me.

  20   Q.  This occurred quite a while ago, your travel back and

  21   forth to Sudan?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  So you are doing your best to remember back that far, is

  24   that right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                1356

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            (Pause)

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  I apologize.

   3   Q.  Do you recall telling the agents when you were interviewed

   4   the first time that it was your best memory that every two or

   5   three months you would spend in Nairobi you would then spend a

   6   month in the Sudan with your family?  Do you remember telling

   7   that?

   8   A.  No, sir I don't remember, but as I said, it's not exactly

   9   two months and another month in Sudan.

  10   Q.  I understand.  It could be two or three months, a lot

  11   depends on your schedule and classes.

  12   A.  Yes, you are right.

  13   Q.  But the amount of time that you tried to spend in the

  14   Sudan when you went back there would hopefully be a month.

  15   A.  Yes, sometimes.

  16   Q.  Sometimes it might only be two or three weeks but

  17   sometimes it might be four weeks.

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  Obviously you tried to spend as much time with your family

  20   having been away from them for that long.

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Do you remember the letter that you left for Ahmed Sheikh

  23   when you visited in 1998?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Do you remember that the top of the letter, the greetings



                                                                1357

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   part of the letter read something like in the name of God the

   2   merciful and the compassionate, may peace and God's blessings

   3   be upon you, dear Ahmed Sheikh, Allah -- do you remember that

   4   greetings portion?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Is that something that is traditional to do from one

   7   Muslim to another Muslim writing a letter?

   8   A.  It depends on the culture of the Muslim, how it is.  If

   9   you are very good can write good things, if not, you can say

  10   in the name of God the merciful --

  11   Q.  In other words, if you are a good letter writer, you would

  12   put like a blessing or something in the letter?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  That is not an al Qaeda thing, that is simply being a good

  15   Muslim in writing to another Muslim?

  16   A.  Yes.  Many people they can write more than that thing if

  17   they are not from al Qaeda.

  18   Q.  When you were traveling back and forth from Nairobi to the

  19   Sudan, when you were in the Sudan were you working then?

  20   A.  No.

  21   Q.  You had the opportunity to spend time with your family and

  22   time with others that you knew without having to worry about

  23   working in a position.

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  So during that time you had a lot of free time to find out



                                                                1358

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   what was going on with the people in the Sudan.

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  You spent that time not just being close to your family,

   4   your wife and -- you had one child then or did you have a

   5   second?

   6   A.  Excuse me.

   7   Q.  How many children did you have in, say, 1993 and 1994?

   8   A.  In '94 I had only one.

   9   Q.  You spent time with your family but you also spent time

  10   catching up with all the information of things that went on in

  11   the Sudan with people that you knew, is that right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  When you were in Nairobi, you knew Hamad, also known as

  14   Khalid al Fawwaz, is that correct?

  15   A.  Yes, I knew Hamad.

  16   Q.  Did he live with you in the apartment?

  17   A.  No.

  18   Q.  Who lived with you in the apartment?

  19   A.  Abdel Hameed.

  20   Q.  That's a different person than Hamad, right?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  What did Mr. Hameed do?

  23   A.  He is supposed to be assistant of Hamad in the

  24   registration of the company.

  25   Q.  That was Asma Ltd.?



                                                                1359

                              Kherchtou - cross

   3   Q.  What were you doing at the tannery when you were working

   4   there?

   5   A.  We went only for some days to the commercial section with

   6   two guys, Abu Ahmed Sarudi and another guy from Oman.  And we

   7   stayed there sometimes.  Then after a while they told us that

   8   there is no work.

  11   Q.  By the way, when you were in the Sudan both visiting and

  12   immediately after your return, were there any Sudanese

  13   intelligence officers that regularly worked between Bin Laden

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Do you know the names of those individuals?

  17   A.  I know the names of the guy who was taking me myself to

  18   the airport sometimes.

  19   Q.  Who is that?

  20   A.  Abdul Hallek.

  21   Q.  These were Sudanese intelligence, is that correct?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  When you were traveling, it was a Sudanese intelligence

  24   officer that would see you from basically Khartoum to the

  25   airport to make sure that you are actually leaving the



                                                                1364

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   country, is that correct?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Because the Sudanese intelligence kept very close watch

   4   over Bin Laden and Bin Laden's employees and members, is that

   5   right?

   6   A.  It's not every day.  Sometimes you can travel by yourself

   7   if you don't have anything, carrying money or something, you

   8   can travel by yourself to the airport and you do the whole

   9   check-out and you go.

  10   Q.  But if there is anything that you are carrying other than

  11   your own personal belongings, the Sudanese intelligence would

  12   be involved.

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  They were monitoring Mr. Bin Laden and the people in

  15   Khartoum.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to competence as to what

  17   he knows they were doing.

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  I am sorry?

  19            THE COURT:  The question is his competence to testify

  20   as to what the Sudanese were doing.

  21            MR. SCHMIDT:  I will rephrase the question.

  22            THE COURT:  Yes.

  23   Q.  It was your understanding that the Sudanese were keeping

  24   close track of the activities and Mr. Bin Laden and the people

  25   who worked for Mr. Bin Laden, is that right?



                                                                1365

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Sudanese, their role is to take you from your guesthouse

   2   in the morning to the airport and just to make sure you cross

   3   the immigration in the airport.  They don't know what you are

   4   carrying.

   5   Q.  There were a number of people of Egyptian background that

   6   were in the Sudan, is that right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  You knew that many of the Egyptians who were in the Sudan

  11   were very much afraid of the Egyptian government.

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Even people who were not members of al Qaeda were afraid

  14   of the Egyptian government.

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  For example, Abu Tareq, the person who crashed the

  17   airplane?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  He was Egyptian, is that right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And you believed that he was not a member of al Qaeda, is

  22   that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  He actually flew from the Sudan to Nairobi before he went

  25   back to Egypt because he was afraid of letting the Egyptians



                                                                1366

   1   know that he was with Bin Laden.

   2   A.  I don't know when did he flew -- I didn't know if he was

   3   afraid or not.

   4   Q.  Were you aware that religious Egyptians, both al Qaeda

   5   members and non-al Qaeda members, were afraid of imprisonment

   6   and torture from the Egyptian government?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, 401 and competence.

  10   concerning their fear of the Egyptian government?

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Were there times when nonmembers of Al Qaeda were present

  15   during discussions about their fears of the Egyptian

  16   government?

  17   A.  I don't remember if somebody from non-Al Qaeda was staying

  18   with us.  I don't remember.

  19   Q.  Did members of Al Qaeda express the fact that any

  20   apparently religious person traveling to Egypt risked

  21   imprisonment and torture?

  22   A.  Yes.  It was obvious that all people, most of the

  23   Egyptians who were in Afghanistan, if they go back to Egypt

  24   they will be facing tortures.

  25   Q.  It made no difference whether they were Al Qaeda or people



                                                                1367

   1   who were just in Afghanistan for a short period of time, isn't

   2   that correct?

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, competence and 401.

   4            THE COURT:  Yes.

   5   Q.  You knew also many Egyptians who were members, you met

   6   many Egyptians who were members of jihad organizations from

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Was there more than one jihad organization of Egypt that

  10   were in the Sudan when you were there?

  14   Gamaa Islamiya.

  15   Q.  One is often called Egyptian -- EIJ.  Egyptian Islamic

  16   Jihad.

  17   A.  I said Gamaa Jihad and al Gamaa al Islamiya, it means

  18   Egyptian Jihad of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman.

  19   Q.  When we refer to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, who is the

  20   leader of the group, of that particular group?  Who was the

  21   leader back then?

  22   A.  The leader was Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman.

   8   A.  Al Jihad group.

   9   Q.  Is that the same group that Abdel Rahman was a leader of?

  10   A.  No.

  11   Q.  Two different groups?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Just so we can understand it and use English initials, if

  14   I say IG, which group would that be referring to, with who as

  15   the leader?

  16   A.  Islamic jihad?

  17   Q.  Yes, Islamic Group.

   3   Q.  The Zawahiri group we will refer to as Egyptian Islamic

   4   Jihad.  Is that sometimes referred to as that?

   5   A.  The translation I don't know.

   6   Q.  It would be Islamic Jihad, is that correct, from Egypt?

   7   A.  We call it Gamaa Jihad, it means Al Jihad Group of Egypt.

   8   Q.  Al Jihad Group of Egypt.

   9   A.  OK.

  10   Q.  These two groups obviously were not, the leadership was

  11   not able to stay in Egypt, is that right?

  12   A.  Excuse me.

  13   Q.  That leadership was wanted in Egypt.  They would be

  14   arrested and imprisoned and tortured and maybe executed,

  15   right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  You went to the front and you fought for them, is that

  21   right?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And when you joined al Qaeda it was your understanding

  24   that these are the kind of battles that you would participate

  25   in if you were a member of al Qaeda?



                                                                1388

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And, in fact, you brought many friends and associates in

   3   battle in Chechnia?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And southern Bosnia?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Do you know if any of your fellow al Qaeda members went to

   8   Turjakistan to fight against the old Communist ruler in

   9   Turjakistan?

  10   A.  Turjakistan they went I think in '95.

  11   Q.  And that was what you envisioned the type of fights that

  12   you would participate in as a member of al Qaeda; is that

  13   correct?

  14   A.  I didn't get you.

  15   Q.  The battles in Afghanistan, the battle against Russians in

  16   Chechnia, the battles in Bosnia against the Serbs, the battles

  17   against the Armies of the old Soviet ruler in Turjakistan,

  18   those are the kinds of battles that you thought that you would

  19   participate in as a member of al Qaeda, isn't that correct?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  Now, the Egyptian jihad group mostly kept to themselves in

  22   Sudan; is that right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  They had their own guest house?

  25   A.  I think so.

<P>

                                                                1389

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  They had their own farm?

   2   A.  I don't know.

   3   Q.  Now, there was people that you understood who were

   4   recently Egyptian Islam jihad like Mr. Banshiri and Abu Hafs

   5   who were with Bin Laden since the beginning, is that right?

   6   A.  You mean Jalal --

   7   Q.  Abu Hafs and Banshiri were with Mr. Bin Laden from way

   8   back in Afghanistan in the late '70s, '79, '80, '81 something

   9   like that, is that right?

  10   A.  They were there before I we came to Pakistan.

  11   Q.  Were they back then members of the Egyptian jihad?

  12   A.  I don't think so.

  13   Q.  Were they al Qaeda people?

  14   A.  Excuse me?

  15   Q.  Whether they were actually bayat or not, they were with

  16   the al Qaeda people?

  17   A.  Well, they are leaders in the al Qaeda.

  18   Q.  Do you know a person named Kalal?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  That person you understood was arrested in Croatia?

  21   A.  Which Kalal?

  22   Q.  The one who was arrested in Croatia?

  23   A.  I know him.

  24   Q.  And what organization was he part of?

  25   A.  He's from Sheik Rahman.



                                                                1390

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  He was arrested in Kuwait and the Americans gave him --

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, to 401, Judge.

   3            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   4   Q.  I'll rephrase that question.  Now, it was your

   5   understanding that --

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to 401.

   7   Q.  -- that the Egyptian --

   8            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   9   Q.  Was he with the Sheik Rahman group?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Now, it's your understanding that that group of people

  12   were very angry at the Americans for giving Kalal to the

  13   Egyptian government, isn't that correct?

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, your Honor, 401.

  15            THE COURT:  We'll take our mid-morning recess at this

  16   point.

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            (Jury not present)

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  I have three objections, your Honor.

   3   During my direct examination Mr. Schmidt has tried to hold us

   4   to a very narrow exception to the hearsay rule and

   5   coconspirator statements, but on cross-examination he thinks

   6   he can ask everyone, what do you think.

   7            Number two, to what the organization believes is as

   8   to what happens to a particular person who is directed by

   9   where he was who may have taken him to a country or not

  10   whether that's true or not it is unfairly prejudicial.

  11            Number three, we have sent out much evidence of what

  12   the Egyptian groups have done at the defense requests, they

  13   are killing people, bombing people and strafing tourist buses

  14   in Egypt, and yet all we get is questions about what will

  15   happen to people in al Qaeda if they go foe back to Egypt.

  16            They want to keep out the violence but they want to

  17   present before the jury that the Egyptians, one of the people

  18   playing soccer blew up the Egyptian in Islamabad.  The defense

  19   wants us to keep out anything that's bad that these people did

  20   so the defendants aren't prejudiced, but get in everything

  21   that anyone perceives the foreign government might have done

  22   wrong in trying to link it to the American government.

  23            I think it's improper.  I don't see it goes to the

  24   witness' credibility.  I don't see it goes to the issues in

  25   this case whether or not Wadih el Hage joined the conspiracy



                                                                1392

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   to kill Americans, what it is that a different group that he

   2   didn't belong to thinks may have happened to a persona in a

   3   foreign country.

   4            THE COURT:  There is another objection, and that is I

   5   don't find it in the rules of evidence the tediousness is also

   6   a factor.

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, if I may be heard.

   8            THE COURT:  Of course you may.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  The government has brought out hearsay

  10   on their direct examination concerning plots supposedly by EIJ

  11   members as part of al Qaeda to kill or attack Americans as a

  12   result for revenge purposes.  They brought that out on their

  13   case.  We are counteracting that to show that while there is

  14   discussions there, it's -- may I have a moment?

  15            (Pause)

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I believe that first

  17   came up in the case when Mr. Schmidt cross-examined Mr. Al

  18   Fadl about whether or not he first raised the issue in 1997

  19   that he had first raised in October, 1996.  In any event, the

  20   indictment does charge that Egyptian Islamic jihad was working

  21   with Usama Bin Laden fatwas.  It's not hearsay.  It's part of

  22   this conspiracy.  The jihad group and al Qaeda merged and

  23   worked together for all practical purposes.  That is not

  24   hearsay.  Getting into what happened in Croatia or Egypt and

  25   other things --



                                                                1393

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            MR. SCHMIDT:  What I'm trying to do, your Honor, the

   2   first witness Mr. Jamal tried to make it seem that they were

   3   altogether back in '93, '94, '95.  What I'm trying to do with

   4   this witness is show in truth they were not all together.

   5            THE COURT:  All together in all activities as to all

   6   things, but now assuming that's your objective, have you now

   7   not exhausted that topic?

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, I've not exhausted that topic.  I

   9   have some other issues that Jamal went through that I need to

  10   go with this witness to go through to get the accurate

  11   picture.

  12            THE COURT:  To this witness' knowledge.

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  This witness' knowledge.

  14            THE COURT:  What is the ultimate point you're trying

  15   to make?

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  We have no dispute --

  17            THE COURT:  Fill me in on what the actual point that

  18   you're trying to make is what.

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  That EIJ and Islamic group was a very

  20   separate, has a very separate identity that al Qaeda in '92,

  21   '93, '94, '95, '96 until some point in '98 when they came out

  22   with a joint declaration.  I am trying to show that indeed

  23   that they did have a separate identity that and they were not

  24   mixed like Mr., like Jamal Al Fadl led the jury to believe.

  25   They didn't merge until 19998.  The jury has been left with a



                                                                1394

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   misimpression from the government's first witness and that's

   2   what I'm struggling with, your Honor.

   3            THE COURT:  You know, Mr. Schmidt, you're a very

   4   skilled and experienced attorney, and the point as you just

   5   expressed it now it seems to me does not require an hour and

   6   twenty minutes of examination of the witness which only leads

   7   more to obfuscation than it does to clarity.

   8            I'll permit you to question the witness as to his

   9   personal knowledge of these events, but I do suggest that if

  10   you're really trying to communicate something to the jury an

  11   hour of asking a list of names is not a very effective way of

  12   doing it.  We'll take a five minute recess.

  13            (Recess)

  14            (In open court; not jury present)

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  The stipulation as to the exhibit

  16   should be in the presence of the jury, not in presence of the

  17   witness.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  I would ask your Honor to advise the

  19   jury that it was stipulated that the person in the picture

  20   Wadih El Hage Exhibit WEH C is Jamal Al Fadl.  Your Honor, I

  21   would just ask for a instruction separate from the stipulation

  22   that if the witness testifies as to his understanding of what

  23   it is the American government did or didn't do, that's not

  24   offered for the truth of the matter asserted, just for --

  25            THE COURT:  I'll do that when there is a particular



                                                                1395

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   question.

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, if it's a discussion of a

   3   quote coconspirator conversation then it can be offered for

   4   the truth.

   5            THE COURT:  If it's a statement in furtherance of the

   6   conspiracy by a coconspirator.

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  That's correct.

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, with regard to that, if

   9   people are talking about taking action because they perceive

  10   the Americans are wrong, the relevance is that they are taking

  11   action, not the coconspirator statement whether it's true or

  12   not, it's irrelevant.  If they think American did a bad act

  13   that's to state of mind.  This doesn't prove that America did

  14   a bad act.

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  I have no disagreement with that.

  16            THE COURT:  You marked that photograph WH exhibit C.

  17   Bring the jury in, but not the witness and then the witness.

  18   I'll tell you when to bring in the witness.

   1            (Jury present)

   2            (Witness not present)

   3            THE COURT:  I understand that the parties have

   4   reached a stipulation with respect to exhibit WEHC for

   5   identification which is a photograph shown to this witness.

   6   Will you state the stipulation, please?

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, your Honor.  It was stipulated

   8   between the government and the defendant Wadih El Hage that

   9   the photograph is of Jamal Ahmed Mohammed Al Fadl.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  That's right, Judge.

  11            THE COURT:  So stipulated.  All right.  Bring the

  12   witness in, please.

  13            (Witness resumed)

  14   Q.  Mr. Kherchtou, you heard that the Americans gave Talal to

  15   the Egyptian government; is that correct?

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, foundation.

  17            MR. SCHMIDT:  It's not for the truth, your Honor.

  18   It's state of mind.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  I'll withdraw the objection.

  20   Instruction as to the state of mind.

  21            THE COURT:  I understand the question that is going

  22   to be asked of what this witness heard or understood, and

  23   understand that that testimony is relevant to this witness'

  24   understanding and this witness' state of mind, and not

  25   evidence of the truth of what it is that he had heard.



                                                                1397

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            The law provides that statements made by

   2   coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy are

   3   admissible.  In other words, the usual hearsay rules which

   4   would preclude testimony of what other people, not witnesses,

   5   said recognizes an exception and the exception relates to

   6   statements made by coconspirators in furtherance of the

   7   conspiracy, not just casual observations about irrelevant

   8   things.

   9            But we've heard an awful lot of testimony by

  10   witnesses who have said that they were members of al Qaeda and

  11   this is what other members of al Qaeda said, and that

  12   testimony has been received without limitation.  So there is

  13   that distinction between statements made by coconspirators in

  14   furtherance of the conspiracy and other statements which are

  15   being offered simply to show the state of mind of the

  16   listener.  Sometimes the distinction may be obvious, in which

  17   case the attorneys may request or I may on my own impose a

  18   limitation.

  19   Q.  You may answer the request.

  20            THE COURT:  You'd better restate the question.

  21   Q.  Did you understand that Talal was given over by the

  22   American government to the Egyptian government?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Was that information part of a discussion that you ever

  25   had with al Qaeda members?



                                                                1398

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Would it be fair to say that al Qaeda did not ever discuss

   3   any type of revenge against the Americans as a result of this

   4   Islamic group member being turned over to the Egyptians?

   5   Would that be a fair statement?

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7   A.  No.

   8   Q.  That is not a fair statement or it is a fair statement?

   9   Let me rephrase the question.

  10   A.  Okay.

  11   Q.  Was there any discussion that you heard of any revenge by

  12   al Qaeda against the Americans for what happened to Talal of

  13   the Islamic group?

  14   A.  No.

  15   Q.  Now, you also heard that Sheik Rahman the leader of the

  16   Islamic group was arrested in the United States; is that

  17   correct?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And any discussion of revenge for his arrest came from the

  20   Egyptian group, the Islamic group, is that correct?

  21   A.  I didn't hear anything.

  22   Q.  Did you hear anything in al Qaeda about any revenge from

  23   al Qaeda?

  24   A.  No, but the, there was talking that they didn't like the

  25   fact that one of the Islamic scholars were arrested in the



                                                                1399

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   United States.

   2   Q.  They opposed the United States arresting Sheik Rahman?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Do you recall the first time that you met Mr. El Hage?

   5   A.  Wadih El Hage?

   6   Q.  Yes.

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Was that in the Sudan?

   9   A.  I don't remember exactly if I met him in Sudan or I was

  10   visiting in the beginning, but I remember very well when he

  11   came the first time to Kenya.

  12   Q.  So you may have heard about Mr. El Hage prior to him

  13   coming to Kenya but you're not sure if you saw him?

  14   A.  Yes, I heard about him, yes.

  15   Q.  Now, you looked at a photograph of Mr. El Hage that the

  16   government showed you with a beard.  Do you remember that?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And do you remember that you had some difficulty saying

  19   for certain whether that was Mr. El Hage or not?

  20   A.  No, I didn't recognize, they gave me a bunch of pictures,

  21   I didn't recognize him, and the second time I think the second

  22   day I recognized him.

  23   Q.  Now, many people when they were in the Sudan dressed and

  24   their facial hair was more in comportment with traditional

  25   Islam look, is that correct?



                                                                1400

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Not all of them.

   2   Q.  But some of them did?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And sometimes it was difficult recognizing somebody who

   5   you saw with a full Islamic beard and maybe an Islamic outfit

   6   when you see them in western clothes and clean shaven?

   7   A.  It is changes.

   8   Q.  There is only one Abu Ahmed that you know of, is that

   9   correct?

  10   A.  Which Abu Ahmed.

  11   Q.  That's and Abu Ahmed who was an Egyptian artillery

  12   specialist that you knew from Afghanistan; is that correct?

  13   A.  There is no artillery specialist.

  14   Q.  The person is also known as Abu Ahmed al Houn?

  15   A.  There is no Abu al Houn.

  16   Q.  Now, what you learned about Mr. El Hage even before

  17   meeting him was that he was a person who was one of the first

  18   ones to come to Afghanistan; is that right?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Now, were you aware that he actually came from the United

  21   States to Afghanistan?

  22   A.  I heard that.

  23   Q.  That was especially among al Qaeda people that somebody

  24   that early on in the Afghani freedom war would come from the

  25   United States?



                                                                1401

                              Kherchtou - cross

   4   took bayat in al Qaeda, is that correct?

   6   Q.  And it's your understanding that Mr. El Hage was

   9   Q.  By Mr. Bin Laden.

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And one of the reasons that you're aware of that he was

  12   considered trustworthy person is because of his early

  13   assistance given to the Afghani cause; is that right?

  14   A.  Because he was one of the first people who went to

  15   Afghanistan.

  16   Q.  That was really before, certainly before al Qaeda; is that

  17   correct?

  18   A.  Probably, yes.

  18   Q.  And soon after that is when Abu Hafs and others came in

  20   A.  I wasn't there when he came.  I really told that he came

  21   there, but I wasn't there.

  22   Q.  You weren't present in Nairobi when the airplane was flown

  23   from Khartoum to Nairobi?

  24   A.  It was before I arrived to Nairobi.

  25   Q.  Now, Mr. El Hage arrived -- did Abu Ahmed leave Nairobi



                                                                1404

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   before Mr. El Hage arrived?

   2   A.  I think so.

   3   Q.  Would it be fair to say that Mr. El Hage arrived some time

   4   in the fall of 1994?

   5   A.  Yes, he came in '94.

   6   Q.  Would it be fair that it was in autumn, the fall?

   8   Q.  Did Mr. El Hage boss you around?

   9   A.  Excuse me?

  11   this, go do that, go do this?

  12   A.  No.

  13   Q.  You were still taking your flying lessons, is that right?

  15   Q.  And still traveling back to Sudan as often as you could to

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And when you went around, you have to share a room with El

  19   Hage for a while, is that correct?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And he treated you as an equal?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And with respect?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  And together you looked for a house for him and his

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   family, is that right?


   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And you knew that he had his family in Khartoum that he

   4   was very anxious to bring them over to Nairobi to be together.

   5   Is that right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And you knew Nairobi much better than he did because you

   8   had been there for a while by the time Mr. El Hage arrived; is

   9   that right?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  You were leading the search for the house?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And the house has -- withdrawn.  The house has a wall

  14   around the whole piece of property; is that right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And that's not uncommon in middle class section of Nairobi

  17   is it?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  It's common, isn't it?  It's common to have that wall

  20   around the home for protection in Nairobi?

  21   A.  Well, Nairobi is a dangerous city.

  22   Q.  Well, if you live in an area where you can afford there

  23   was an area that was sort of in between Nairobi and the

  24   airport you ultimately found out, is that right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                1406

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  And the development that really stood alone with many

   2   houses in one area where you turned off the road for the

   3   airport and it was surrounded by empty field?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And each house there had a wall around the compound?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  That's because Nairobi is a somewhat dangerous city and

   8   for security purposes if you could have a house with that wall

   9   you would want one?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  And within that wall there are actually two buildings?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  One was the building where Mr. El Hage lived with his wife

  14   and many children, is that right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And there was a back room that had a separate living area

  17   and a bathroom where you were staying initially?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And to get into that back room you did not have to come

  20   into the main house.  You can get there from the driveway, is

  21   that right?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  How long did you stay there?

  24   A.  Well, I don't remember exactly how long.

  25   Q.  Did you stay in your own apartment for a little while?



                                                                1407

   1   A.  No, I don't understand.

   2   Q.  When did you return to the Sudan in 1995?

   3   A.  Probably the end of '95, yes, or early '96.

   4   Q.  Now, where did you live that whole time?

   5   A.  Where in the Sudan or in Kenya?

   6   Q.  In Kenya.

   7   A.  Well, what happened is exactly when we left and we gave me

   8   him and Hasan together, but when he got that house I moved to

   9   the place with him, and it was time for the exam for flying

  10   course I was taking then I was going to Sudan and came twice.

  11   Once I think when I was doing the exams and another time when

  12   I was renewing the license.

  13   Q.  Was that the only time that you were in Nairobi during

  14   '94, '95 and Mr. El Hage was there?

  15   A.  Yeah.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  17            THE COURT:  Restate the question.

  18   Q.  Mr. El Hage moved in some time in 1994, is that right?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And his family joined him, correct?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And you were in the separate building at his home, right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Then you took your exam shortly thereafter?

  25   A.  Yeah, I think I don't know exactly when in '95.



                                                                1408

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Early '95?

   2   A.  I don't remember, because when after the exams I went back

   3   to Sudan.  Then I came back after a year start to renew the

   4   license for the pilot.

   5   Q.  So after the exam you basically left Nairobi?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  So the only time that you spent with Mr. El Hage was the

   8   period when he came until the exam?

   9   A.  Yeah, he came, I stayed a while but I don't remember how

  10   long it was.

  11   Q.  Two or three months?

  12   A.  Probably, yes, more.

  13   Q.  Now, you came to renew your license is that in 1995 or

  14   1996?

  15   A.  I don't remember the date.

  16   Q.  Well, did you get your license after the exam?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  How long was that license good for?

  19   A.  One year.  Then I have to renew.

  20   Q.  So it's likely if you received your license sometime in

  21   1995 you came back in 1996?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  Now, you told us previously that the person handling the

  24   money in al Qaeda would not give you -- withdrawn.  You told

  25   me that Mr. Bin Laden would not give you money to renew your



                                                                1409

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   license?

   2   A.  Yes, they refused to give me the money.

   3   Q.  Because al Qaeda didn't have -- withdrawn.  You stated

   4   that money was too tight to spend it on renewing your license,

   5   is that right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  You still came to Nairobi, is that right?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And you asked Mr. El Hage to help you renew your license,

  10   is that right?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And even though Mr. Bin Laden said no, Mr. El Hage helped

  13   you with the money?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  He helped you with that even though at that time things

  16   were very poor for Mr. El Hage's economic condition; is that

  17   right?

  18   A.  Repeat the question, please.

  19   Q.  There came a time where the economic conditions for Mr. El

  20   Hage in taking care of his family and himself became

  21   difficult?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And, in fact, he was trying to make all types of business

  24   deals that he could to try to raise money and help support him

  25   and his family; is that right?



                                                                1410

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  There were a number of times that you actually were

   3   involved in some of the business deals that Mr. El Hage was

   4   trying to accomplish; is that right?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Now, for example, when you were working for Abu Abdallah

   7   there was a sugar deal that Mr. El Hage was trying to do.  Is

   8   that correct?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And that was with Mr. Abu Abdallah, is that right?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  That was just a plain straight business deal, is that

  13   right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And you were supposed to fax him information concerning

  16   some prices?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  He actually called you in one of his faxes Captain Jamal,

  19   do you remember that?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  Is that a code name or more like a joke?

  22   A.  No, it's my nickname was Jamal at a time and captain

  23   because I had renew my license at that time.

  24   Q.  That had nothing to do with al Qaeda or anything like

  25   that?



                                                                1411

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  No.

   2   Q.  And Abdul Rakim also tried to be involved in that sugar

   3   transaction, is that right?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And while you were in Kenya when Mr. El Hage was there did

   6   you say that you never saw him prepare any type of report?

   7   A.  I saw him he had his own computer, and what he's doing is

   8   something he was doing something there.

   9   Q.  He was typing letters and faxes and -- business

  10   situations?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, competence.

  12            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  13   Q.  Did you ever tell the government that you never saw Mr. El

  14   Hage writing reports?

  15   A.  I don't remember.

  16   Q.  I understand you it's a little while ago and you answered

  17   lots of questions.  Let's see if we can refresh your

  18   recollection.  I'm going to ask you to take a look at what's

  19   been marked 3535-9, page 19, where I made a little block.

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  May I approach the witness?

  21            THE COURT:  The question isn't what it says there.

  22   the question is whether reading that refreshes your

  23   recollection of a specific event.

  24            Do you understand?  Do you understand what I've just

  25   said?



                                                                1412

   4   read that does that help you remember whether you told the

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  It helped you remember that?

   8   A.  Yeah, he didn't write anything in front of me.

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Also, shortly after that time, also the end of 1991, the

   2   beginning of 1992, people were sent to two other areas in

   3   Somalia, is that correct?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  One was the area that is called Ogaden.

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Ogaden is really in Ethiopia at this period of time, is

   8   that correct?

   9   A.  Until now, yes.

  10   Q.  Even though it's in Ethiopia, the people who live there

  11   are Somalians, is that right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And the reason why it is part of Ethiopia is simply

  14   because when the Europeans divided it up they gave that

  15   portion to the country of Ethiopia.

  16   A.  I don't know what happened.

  17   Q.  They also sent a group of people to the south part of

  18   Somalia near the Kenyan border, is that correct?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Would that be the area that was called the Gedo region of

  21   Somalia?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  In the northern portion of Somalia there were people who

  24   tried to form an Islamic government to rule in the northern

  25   portion of Somalia -- withdrawn.  I will rephrase that



                                                                1428

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   question.

   2            Were you aware in your conversations with Al Qaeda

   3   members that the reason that the group of Al Qaeda people were

   4   sent to the area around Hargeysa was that there was a

   5   religious Islamic group there that was trying to help form an

   6   Islamic government?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And the people in the south, the Gedo region, there was a

   9   group of Islamics that was also trying to form a society based

  10   on Islam, is that correct, based on your conversations with Al

  11   Qaeda members?

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  Just asking for a time frame.

  13   Q.  At the time frame that the people were sent.

  14            THE COURT:  When was that?  When to your knowledge

  15   were Al Qaeda members sent to southern Somalia?

  16   A.  I think before I came to Nairobi, '92, I think.

  17   Q.  Did you think that it might have been the end of 1991 or

  18   the beginning of 1992?

  19   A.  I think during '92, because they were still in

  20   Afghanistan.

  21   Q.  Do you remember when you first were discussing Somalia

  22   with government agents that you told them that Al Qaeda sent

  23   two or three groups to Somalia and Ogaden at the end of 1991

  24   or the beginning of 1992?

  25   A.  Probably, yes.  If I said that, it is correct, but I think



                                                                1429

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   I am wrong.  I think maybe 1992 they came to that place.

   2   Q.  Then if it was 1992, it would be the early part of 1992.

   3   A.  Probably.

   4   Q.  There was actually a group for name for the group in the

   5   southern portion, the Gedo region, is that correct?  Al

   6   Ittihad Al Islami, isn't that right?

   7   A.  Al Ittihad al Islami is the main Islami group in Somalia,

   8   so the same one in the beginning.

   9   Q.  At some point after the Barre regime was overthrown and

  10   there was chaos in Somalia, the al Ittihad group sort of split

  11   to different areas, is that right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Based on your conversations with members of Al Qaeda, is

  14   that right?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  One group formed in the Gedo region of Somalia.

  17            Did you learn from members of Al Qaeda that Somalia

  18   is also broken up by clans?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Did you learn from discussions with members of Al Qaeda

  21   that the clan of Mohamed Faraj Aidid was attacking the clan of

  22   Siad Barre?

  23   A.  I don't know exactly was he attacking Siad Barre, but they

  24   were fighting each others.

  25   Q.  Did you ever hear the word the Marehan clan?


<P>                                                              1430

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Marehan?

   2   Q.  Yes.

   3   A.  Probably heard the name but I don't remember.

   4   Q.  But you were aware that there were fierce battles between

   5   Aideed's group and other groups?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  That was causing great destruction in Somalia?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And it was your understanding that the Islamic groups in

  10   Somalia were trying to end the clan fighting and have a

  11   civilized society that cared for the people of Somalia, is

  12   that right?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  It is your understanding that Al Qaeda members were sent

  15   to help train these religious Somalis to defend their land and

  16   their people.

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  That included the Somalis that lived in the Ogaden, is

  19   that correct?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  The Somalis that lived in the Gedo region, is that

  22   correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  And the unsuccessful attempt of the Somalis that lived in

  25   the north of Hargeysa, is that correct?



                                                                1431

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  All of this, all of this assistance from Al Qaeda occurred

   3   before anybody had any idea that the United Nations or the

   4   United States was going to come and help the Somalis, isn't

   5   that correct?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  Were you aware in your discussions with Al Qaeda that

   8   during the 1992 period, that Aideed was anti-al Ittihad?

   9   A.  I don't know that.

  10   Q.  Did you ever hear the name of a person called Ali Mahdi

  11   Mohamed?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  He had support, based on your conversations with Al Qaeda

  14   members, he had support of the religious Muslims in Somalia,

  15   didn't he?

  16   A.  I don't think so.

  17   Q.  You know that he and Mr. Aideed were fighting constantly

  18   as well.

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  And they were causing destruction in Mogadishu, weren't

  21   they?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  The group, the original group of Al Qaeda people sent to

  24   Nairobi was to establish for logistical purposes, helping the

  25   transit of the Al Qaeda people from Afghanistan into Somalia,



                                                                1432

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   isn't that right?

   2   A.  I don't know who --

   3   Q.  Do you remember saying to the government that the Nairobi

   4   station was established, was only established for the

   5   logistical purposes to help the guys traveling to and from

   6   Somalia?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  That was back either in the end of 1991 or earlier in

   9   1992, is that right?

  10   A.  I said that when I was there, when I knew what they are

  11   doing.

  12   Q.  But there were people from Al Qaeda in Nairobi when you

  13   arrived, right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  They were sent earlier, weren't they?

  16   A.  Yes.  There is one Kenyan from Al Qaeda, he was doing that

  17   job.

  18   Q.  Some period of time after the Al Qaeda people were in

  19   southern, south, the area of the Gedo region in Somalia, the

  20   area of the Ogaden region in Somalia, there came a time when

  21   the UN came into Somalia.  Do you remember that?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And at some point American troops also came into Somalia,

  24   is that right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                1433

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Already the members of Al Qaeda were in Somalia, or in and

   2   out of Somalia and back in Somalia for almost a year by the

   3   time the UN and the Americans went into Somalia.

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Did you learn about the attacks by the UN and the

   6   Americans on groups in Somalia?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

   8            THE COURT:  Yes.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  This goes to his state --

  10            THE COURT:  Yes, but from whom.

  11            MR. SCHMIDT:  Withdraw that.

  12   Q.  Did you have discussions in Al Qaeda about the American

  13   and UN attacks on certain groups of Somalis?

  14   A.  I don't know if they were attacking certain groups but

  15   there was problems there in Mogadishu.

  16   Q.  Do you recall if you heard from other Al Qaeda members

  17   that the problems, one of the major sources of the problems

  18   was Mr. Aideed?

  19   A.  Yes.

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Did you ever see film or photographs or a report of an

   2   attack by American troops on what is called Abdi House?

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, your Honor.

   4            MR. COHN:  I would like to be objection.  I would

   5   like to be heard on this at sidebar at some point.

   6            THE COURT:  I tell you, I am told the jurors' lunches

   7   are here.  So why don't we break for lunch until 2:00.

   8            (Jury excused)

   9            (Record read)

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  My objection, he is asking in

  11   essence has he seen TV reports, photos, film?  This is classic

  12   hearsay.  He has to limit it to Al Qaeda discussions or he

  13   wasn't there.  On direct, every objection is to foundation and

  14   competence, and now he is asking if he has ever seen TV.

  15            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, my objection is somewhat more

  16   general, and it is precautionary.  It was my understanding at

  17   the beginning of this trial that we were not going to get into

  18   the shoot-out, the 18 dead Americans and dragging an American

  19   body through the street, and it is my fear that this line of

  20   questioning opens the door to that if the government wishes to

  21   enter.  So I object.  I don't think it is particularly

  22   relevant from our point of view.  I don't speak for Mr.

  23   Schmidt's view of its relevance to his case, but I believe I

  24   speak for the capital defendants at least, that we object.

  25            THE COURT:  Mr. Schmidt.



                                                                1435

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I am obviously not bringing

   2   out the information about the Abdi House attack for the truth

   3   of the matter at this time through this witness.

   4            THE COURT:  What are you bringing it out for?

   5            MR. SCHMIDT:  I am bringing it out for his state of

   6   mind and then the Al Qaeda's state of mind about the American

   7   conduct in Somalia.

   8            THE COURT:  What is the significance of his state of

   9   mind with respect to the American conduct in Somalia?

  10            MR. SCHMIDT:  It is his state of mind and the

  11   discussions with Al Qaeda's state of mind.  Not just his in

  12   particular, it is also Al Qaeda's.

  13            THE COURT:  Let's take them one at a time.  What is

  14   the relevance of his state of mind with respect to American

  15   actions in Somalia?

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  It is not just his, it's Al Qaeda's.

  17   Also he apparently --

  18            THE COURT:  All right.  If we are limiting it then to

  19   what this witness can tell us about Al Qaeda's state of mind

  20   with respect to American actions in Somalia, then the

  21   questioning would be limited to what Al Qaeda members told him

  22   on that subject.  Don't you agree?

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Or what he told other Al Qaeda members.

  24            THE COURT:  What is what he told -- if his state is

  25   irrelevant, what is the relevance of what he told them?



                                                                1436

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            MR. SCHMIDT:  What he told that person becomes aware

   2   of this, it becomes that person's state of mind.  Moreover --

   3            THE COURT:  No, no, no.  That's too remote.  If you

   4   want to say did he have a conversation with Al Qaeda members

   5   concerning Americans' actions in Somalia, that's a permissible

   6   question.  If you want to follow up, and what did Al Qaeda

   7   members tell you of Americans' actions in Somalia, that's a

   8   permissible question.

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  It is also my understanding of the plea

  10   of this witness that the crime that he is charged involves his

  11   conduct in relation to Americans in Somalia.

  12            THE COURT:  Yes.

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  So that is part of his plea and his

  14   state of mind is part of --

  15            THE COURT:  And the relevance of that to El Hage is

  16   what?

  17            MR. SCHMIDT:  The government claims that Mr. El Hage

  18   is part of Al Qaeda.  But now I am going into his credibility

  19   and his involvement in the criminal acts that he has pled

  20   guilty to.

  21            THE COURT:  You can ask him what he did, what acts he

  22   took, assuming you haven't covered that already, and I thought

  23   you had.  You asked him whether part of his assignment besides

  24   learning how to fly was to help, and he said to the extent I

  25   could.



                                                                1437

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1            MR. SCHMIDT:  If I may, your Honor, his state of

   2   mind --

   3            THE COURT:  So are we in agreement now that films, TV

   4   or what he read is not a permissible question?  I will sustain

   5   the objection to that question.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  I believe that I should be allowed to

   7   go into his state of mind since it is part of the conduct he

   8   pled guilty to, so I can cross-examine him as to his state of

   9   mind.  And then where and how he developed his state of mind

  10   is relevant.

  11            THE COURT:  If you want to ask him what he did in

  12   connection with Al Qaeda and Somalia, assuming you haven't

  13   done that already, you may ask him that.  If you want to ask

  14   him why he did it, what his motivation for doing it was, you

  15   may ask him that.

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, he --

  17            THE COURT:  Let me finish, please.

  18            But the assumption that you can use this to ask

  19   anything with respect to Americans' actions in Somalia is

  20   inappropriate.

  21            Now there is another question.  Assuming you do all

  22   that, Mr. Cohn's objection is that it would open the door to

  23   matters which the government has agreed it will not pursue in

  24   this case, and obviously you can't have it both ways.

  25            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, my simple response to that



                                                                1438

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   is, the government, before we started the trial said that they

   2   were willing to take out the overt act, and we assumed that

   3   Somalia was not going to be an issue, immediately goes into

   4   Somalia, that Al Qaeda is responsible for all the killings of

   5   all the Americans in Somalia.  So they have brought it out and

   6   we have to deal with that issue already.  The idea of not

   7   being specific or a specific attack is, I think, ludicrous if

   8   they are saying they are involved in all the killings of the

   9   United States but we are not going to talk about a specific

  10   one.  We have to deal with that.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Just so we are clear, your Honor, we

  12   have not agreed to take that issue off the table.  What we did

  13   agree was to discuss whether certain discovery and other

  14   issues would be mooted if one overt act was not proven.  We

  15   have still to hear back on that.  We have agreed not to offer

  16   the proof at this time and we have held that decision in

  17   suspense until we hear a response.  I don't want anyone to

  18   think that we have waived anything.

  19            THE COURT:  To summarize where we are, I will permit

  20   you to ask this witness, to the extent that you have not

  21   already done so, as to what actions he took with respect to Al

  22   Qaeda and Somalia.  I will permit you to ask him his

  23   motivation for doing this, why he did that, and I will permit

  24   you to ask what he was told by Al Qaeda members with respect

  25   to the Al Qaeda operation in Somalia.  And now we are



                                                                1439

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   adjourned for lunch until 2:00.

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  If I may, your Honor, what I would like

   3   to do is also question him concerning not only what he did but

   4   his state of mind.

   5            THE COURT:  You may ask him why he did what he did.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  I just don't want to ask that

   7   particular open-ended question like that, because this is

   8   cross-examination.

   9            THE COURT:  Yes.  Give me an example of what you want

  10   to ask him.

  11            MR. SCHMIDT:  I will think about that and I will give

  12   you the example after lunch, your Honor.

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, could counsel indicate

  14   whether he intends to get into the number of civilian

  15   casualties in Somalia as part of his questions of the

  16   witness's state of mind?

  17            THE COURT:  Do you want to respond to that, Mr.

  18   Schmidt?

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  I don't know at this time.

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  We would have a standing objection

  21   and ask to be heard before we do that and I would alert other

  22   counsel that that issue would certainly impact on our decision

  23   whether to omit the overt act.

  24            THE COURT:  Adjourned until 2:00.

   6   attention?

   7            MR. COHN:  I'm afraid so.

   4   counsel to consult with clients.  Mr. Schmidt, you may

   5   continue.

   6   BY MR. SCHMIDT:

   7   Q.  Mr. Kherchtou, I'd like you to take a look at defendant

   8   Wadih El Hage Exhibit D, Somalia map.  If we can have that

   9   shown to the witness and counsel please.

  10            Is that then on your screen over there?

  11   A.  No, sir.

  12            THE COURT:  Yes, there it is.

  13            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

  14   Q.  Now, does that map of Somalia, is that a fair and accurate

  15   representation of the country of Somalia?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17            MR. SCHMIDT:  I offer that into evidence.

  18            THE COURT:  Any objection?  Received.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  No.

  20            (Defendant's Exhibit D received in evidence)

  21   Q.  Now show that to the jury.  Thank you.

  22            Now, on the map you can see where the city of

  23   Hargeysa is.  Is that the city in the center, upper center of

  24   the map?

  25   A.  Excuse me?



                                                                1444

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  The word Hargeysa?

   2   A.  Yeah, it's in the north.

   3   Q.  Is that the one of the places that al Qaeda sent

   4   representatives in late 1991, early 1992?

   5   A.  I don't know exactly the city, but probably in the north

   6   in this area.

   7   Q.  Now, I ask you to take a look where it says Ogaden.  Do

   8   you see that?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Now, Ogaden as marked there is part of Ethiopia, is that

  11   correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  But the Ogadeni people are Somalis, is that right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Now, is it one of the areas that al Qaeda sent people in

  16   late 1991 early 1992 was the border area of the Ogaden with

  17   Ethiopia and Somalia?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  Now, I ask you to look down at the area around Kenya?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And that's the southern portion of Somalia is the area

  22   around Kenya.  Now, is the ghetto region in the area

  23   approximately where the name Kenya is over the border into

  24   Somalia?

   2   A.  It's in the north of this map, in the northeast.

   3   Q.  That's the --

   4   A.  Not where the word Kenya is written, but it's in the

   5   northeast.

   6   Q.  So that's above where the word Kenya is?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Closer towards Ethiopia?

   9   A.  Close to the border with Ethiopia.

  10   Q.  In fact some of the people -- withdrawn.  Actually, some

  11   of the Ali Tahad in the ghetto region were attacked by

  12   Ethiopian groups, are you aware of that?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Thank you, sir.

  15            Now, did you have discussions with or did you hear

  16   members of al Qaeda discussing the attacks on Somalis by the

  17   UN and the United States troops in Somalia?

  18   A.  No.

  19   Q.  Did Abu Mohamed Masry go to Somalia at some period in

  20   time?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Now, did he go, was it -- withdrawn.

  23            When he went to Somalia was in 1994, isn't that

  24   correct?

  25   A.  Abu Masry?  He went to Somalia, yes.



                                                                1446

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  It was in 1994 that he went so Somalia, isn't that

   2   correct?

   3   A.  He went before that I think, yeah.

   4   Q.  Now, you had a lot of conversations with the, with agents

   5   of the United States, is that correct?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And do you recall the first conversation that you had with

   8   them was in August 25 of last year?

   9   A.  August 25th?  I don't remember the exact date.

  10   Q.  It was around the end of August?

  11   A.  Yeah.

  12   Q.  And would it be fair to describe that you had

  13   approximately 26 meetings with the American officials between

  14   that first one in the end of August and the very beginning of

  15   January of this year?

  16   A.  Yeah, probably.

  17   Q.  Now, in one of those conversations on August -- excuse

  18   me -- August 21st, it was the end of August, did you tell the

  19   government that when Mohamed el Masry went to Somalia it was

  20   approximately 1994?

  21   A.  If I say that, yes.

  22   Q.  Well I'm going to show you what's marked as 3505-7, page

  23   4.  I'm going to ask you to take a look at what's written

  24   there, that's in brackets.  Read it to yourself and then I'll

  25   ask you a question.



                                                                1447

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Okay.

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  May I approach the witness, Judge?

   3            THE COURT:  Yes.

   4            (Pause)

   5   Q.  Now, having read that, does that help you remember that

   6   when Mohammed al Masry went to Somalia about 1994?

   7   A.  Well, in this statement I said they are talking about he

   8   went in Somalia then went to Mogadishu, but Mohammed went to

   9   Somalia before that.

  10   Q.  He went to Mogadishu then in 1994, would that be more

  11   accurate?

  12   A.  I think so, yes.

  13   Q.  So earlier he went to other parts of Somalia, and then in

  14   1994 he went to Mogadishu?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  Thank you.

  17            Was he with one of the first groups that went to

  18   either the northern section, the Ogaden section or the ghetto

  19   section of Somalia?

  20   A.  I think he went first in ghetto section.

  21   Q.  That was back in either late 1991 or early 1992, is that

  22   right?

  23   A.  Yeah, I wasn't there when he went there.

  24   Q.  Now, in 1994 Mr. Bin Laden made some statements about the

  25   US in Saudi Arabia, is that right?



                                                                1448

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  He also made some statements about the US in --

   3   A.  No, at that time he didn't talk about Somalia.

   4   Q.  Did you in either 1994 or earlier ever hear of any fatwas

   5   issued by or for Usama Bin Laden concerning Saudi Arabia, the

   6   Gulf War or Somalia?

   7   A.  Fatwa?

   8   Q.  Fatwa.

   9   A.  No.

  10   Q.  Did you ever hear of fatwa issued in 1995 by or for

  11   Mr. Bin Laden?

  12   A.  I don't remember.

  13   Q.  Is this something that you would likely remember if you

  14   heard it?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  In fact, the first fatwa that you heard was about Saudi

  17   Arabia, and it was directed to the Saudi citizens, isn't that

  18   right?

  19   A.  Well, this is a difference between fatwa and statement.

  20   Fatwa is something that issued by one of the Islamic scholars,

  21   and it's something religious that everybody must follow, but

  22   if a statement it must be opinion, I can follow that or not.

  23   It's not mandatory.

  24   Q.  So Mr. Bin Laden 1996 issued a statement, not a fatwa?

  25   A.  When he, from Afghanistan he issued a fatwa, but it's not



                                                                1449

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   him who issue the fatwa.  He's talking about the other Islamic

   2   scholars who agreed about that fatwa, but not him.

   3   Q.  That was directed to the Saudis; is that correct?

   4   A.  '96?

   5   Q.  Yes?

   6   A.  I don't remember.  It was in general about United States.

   7   Q.  Now, you told us that you received some type of training

   8   by Mohammed al Amriki when you were in Pakistan, is that

   9   correct?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Now, do you remember what year that was?

  12   A.  Probably the early '93.

  13   Q.  You left Pakistan near the end of 1993.  Is that right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Now, did you do any surveillance on behalf of Mohammed al

  16   Amriki or Usama Bin Laden or anybody in 1993 other than your

  17   training?

  18   A.  During the training?

  19   Q.  Other than the training?

  20   A.  No.

  21   Q.  And in the training did you do surveillance of a police

  22   station?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Now, in late 1993 or early 1994 you saw Mohammed al Amriki

  25   again; is that correct?



                                                                1450

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Where?

   2   Q.  Late 1993 or early 1994?

   3   A.  I think it's '94.

   4   Q.  Would that be early part of 1994?

   5   A.  Probably, yes.

   6   Q.  And you were in, living in Nairobi with Mr. Hamid, right?

   7   A.  Abdul Hamid.

   8   Q.  Now, you described to us previously the setup of what

   9   Mohammed al Amriki did to the apartment, you remember

  10   describing it to us?

  11   A.  When they took small part of my apartment?

  12   Q.  That's correct.

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And they took the part that they blocked off for the dark

  15   room was the part furthest from the room that you were staying

  16   in with Mr. Hamid.  Is that right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Now, at that time you were, excuse me -- Mr. Al Fa was or

  19   Hamad was still in Kenya; is that correct?

  20   A.  Yes.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And Wadih El Hage was either in the Sudan or traveling

  22   around Europe on behalf of Usama Bin Laden's companies, is

  23   that right?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  25            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'll rephrase the question.



                                                                1451

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Mr. El Hage was not in Kenya at that time, is that

   2   correct?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Now, whenever there was -- withdrawn.  At the end of the

   5   day all of the negatives or photographs were taken from your

   6   apartment with Mohammed al Amriki and the others, is that

   7   correct?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  Nothing was ever left in the apartment that had anything

  10   to do with why they were there; is that correct?

  11   A.  That had anything what?

  12   Q.  Nothing, no photographs, reports, films, negatives were

  13   left in the house with you, is that right?

  14   A.  No.  It's right, yes.

  15   Q.  Thank you.

  16            And, in fact, whenever there was film, negatives,

  17   photographs or reports present in your apartment there was

  18   always someone there from the group, that group, who came with

  19   Mohammed al Amriki to make sure nobody else gets to see it?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  This was a very secretive operation, is that right?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  And while you saw things going on in the apartment, no one

  24   talked to you about that.  Is that correct?

  25   A.  No.



                                                                1452

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  They talked to you about that?

   2   A.  No.

   3   Q.  Did anyone talk to you about what was going on in the

   4   apartment?

   5   A.  No, I know that they are doing something in the apartment.

   6   Q.  But no one talked about it at all other than what you saw;

   7   is that correct?

   8   A.  How can I if I knew what they are doing, how can they tell

   9   me, we are developing pictures?

  10   Q.  Well, they didn't talk to you about what the pictures

  11   were?

  12   A.  No.

  13   Q.  Did they talk to you about what the pictures were?

  14   A.  No.

  15   Q.  Did you talk to Mr. Hamad about the pictures?

  16   A.  No.

  17   Q.  Did you talk to Mr. Hamid about the pictures?

  18   A.  Well, they all see the same what I saw.

  19   Q.  But you didn't have discussions beyond what you just saw,

  20   is that right?

  21   A.  I don't think so.

  22   Q.  Because this was something that was very secret and you

  23   knew that you really shouldn't be about having conversations

  24   about that with other people, even people who were in al

  25   Qaeda; is that right?



                                                                1453

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Sometimes, yes.

   2   Q.  Well, this was one of the things that you wouldn't discuss

   3   with anybody, isn't that right?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Now, Mr. Amriki was also and Egyptian; is that right?

   6   A.  Who?

   7   Q.  He was an American, an Egyptian?

   8   A.  Who, Amriki?

   9   Q.  Yes?

  10   A.  You said Mr. Amriki.

  11   Q.  Mohammed Amriki was an Egyptian, is that right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And he was also present there with another Egyptian that

  14   you don't remember his name, is that correct?

  15   A.  No, I remember his name.

  16   Q.  What was name?

  17   A.  Abu Harad el Masry.

  18   Q.  Now, sometime later you were living in the room off of Mr.

  19   El Hage's family's home when Mohammed al Amriki came back; is

  20   that right?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Now, how long after that event did you leave to go back to

  23   the Sudan?

  24   A.  I don't remember.

  25   Q.  When Mohammed al Amriki spoke with you about Senegal he



                                                                1454

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   spoke to you in your room that was separate from Mr. El Hage's

   2   family's home; is that correct?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And Mohammed al Amriki when he came to the house he did

   5   not have all of the material that they had had at the earlier

   6   surveillance; is that correct?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  So there was no cameras, there was no film, there was no

   9   developers, no machines, is that correct?

  10   A.  I think he had a camera but it's seems normal.

  11   Q.  When you say you think he had a camera, do you think

  12   that's sort of a guess at this point?

  13   A.  Excuse me?

  14   Q.  Is that a guess, are you guessing that he had a camera?

  15   A.  He had a camera, yes.

  16   Q.  You remember having a conversation in August 19th, 2000

  17   with a representative of the government where you told him

  18   that they did not have any cameras because they were not ready

  19   to go to Senegal at the time?

  20            Do you remember saying that?

  21   A.  If it says it, yes.

  22   Q.  Well, let me show you what's marked as 3505-6, page 22.

  23            May I approach the witness, your Honor?

  24            THE COURT:  Yes.

  25            Now, you read that, is that correct?



                                                                1455

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Now, back in August -- withdrawn.  Have you ever testified

   3   in any proceeding before?

   4   A.  No.

   5   Q.  Are you nervous about sitting here and being asked

   6   questions and giving the answers before everybody here?

   7   A.  Yes, normal I think.

   8   Q.  Excuse me?

   9   A.  I think it's normal here.

  10   Q.  Were you more comfortable back in August when you were

  11   sitting down and talking with the government?

  12   A.  I think it was the same thing.  I never sit with the

  13   government before.

  14   Q.  Now, having reviewed the document do you have a present

  15   recollection, do you remember now that there was wasn't a

  16   camera, that Mr. Mohamed al Amriki, al Amriki did not have a

  17   camera back then?  Is that your accurate recollection?

  18   A.  No, I think he had a camera.

  19   Q.  You remember now saying to the government back then that

  20   he did not have a camera?

  21   A.  Well, I think because you interested in this small things

  22   I remembered that.  You refreshed my mind.  But the camera

  23   wasn't for anything here.

  24   Q.  It wasn't?

  25   A.  I mean Mohammed is carrying a lot of stuff everyday, every



                                                                1456

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   time.

   2   Q.  He's always traveling with a lot of different items?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  He was staying in the room with you when he was there?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  And his belongings remained in that room?

   7   A.  Excuse me?

   8   Q.  His belongings, his luggage remained in that room?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Now, again how many days was Mohammed al Amriki with you

  11   in the room outside of Mr. El Hage's house?

  12   A.  I don't remember.

  13   Q.  I mean, was it a few days or a week?

  14   A.  No, it was a few days.

  15   Q.  And, again, this was something when you spoke to Mr.

  16   Mohamed al Amriki, the surveillance was something that you

  17   wouldn't talk to with anybody else, is that right?

  18   A.  I shouldn't, yes.

  19   Q.  And in fact, you didn't, isn't that correct?

  20   A.  I don't remember.

  21   Q.  Now, in Nairobi Moy Avenue is a major street in downtown

  22   Nairobi, is that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  There are many government buildings on Moy Avenue; is that

  25   right?



                                                                1457

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  I don't know.

   2   Q.  Within a block or so of Moy Avenue?

   3   A.  Government buildings they are not in Moy Avenue I think.

   4   Q.  There are many airline companies?

  20   Q.  Many countries have offices downtown Nairobi; is that

  21   correct?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  Now, you said on direct examination that it was clear that

  24   at some point the United States was the enemy of all the

  25   Muslims groups in the Sudan.  You remember saying that?



                                                                1458

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Now, do you recall Mr. Bin Laden ->
<HR><H3>Transfer interrupted!</H3>
t be fair to say that while Mr. Bin Laden was

   4   in the Sudan he didn't express great animosity towards the

   5   United States?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.  Express to whom?

   7            THE COURT:  And his knowledge.  I sustain the

   8   objection to the form of the question.

   9   Q.  Would it be fair to say that you never heard Mr. Bin Laden

  10   express great animosity towards the United States when he was

  11   in the Sudan?

  12   A.  Excuse me.

  13            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  14   A.  Probably I heard him.  I can't --

  15   Q.  You can't remember?

  16   A.  Yeah.

  17   Q.  So if he said something it would be something that was

  18   something that didn't stick in your mind?

  19   A.  Because the matter was obvious.  He can talk about that.

  20   Q.  Well, would it be fair to say that Mr. Bin Laden and many

  21   Muslims were not, many members of al Qaeda, were not happy

  22   that the United States remained in Saudi Arabia after the

  23   Iraqis were thrown out?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Is it fair to say that not only al Qaeda and Mr. Bin



                                                                1459

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Laden, that most Muslims were not happy with the United States

   2   remaining in the land of the holy places after the Iraqis were

   3   thrown out?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, competence again, your

   5   Honor, speaking on behalf of most Muslims.

   6            THE COURT:  Ask him what he understood and what the

   7   basis of that understanding.

   8   Q.  Is it your understanding that most Muslims were not happy

   9   with the Americans remaining in the land of the holy places

  10   after the Iraqis were thrown out?

  11   A.  Yes, not most Muslims because many Muslims they don't know

  12   what's going on.  Maybe I can say just groups, Islamic groups.

  13            THE COURT:  What was the basis of your understanding?

  14            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  15            THE INTERPRETER:  The conversations that were going

  16   on or carried out.

  17            MR. SCHMIDT:  Excuse me?

  18            THE INTERPRETER:  The conversations that were carried

  19   out, what was being said.

  20   Q.  Now, the conversations showed many people in al Qaeda and

  21   the other Islamic groups their displeasure of the Americans

  22   remaining in Saudi Arabia, is that right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Now, however, there is a difference, a big difference

  25   between viewing the United States as an enemy because they are



                                                                1460

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   present in Saudi Arabia versus actually attacking Americans.

   2   Isn't that right?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And your view and the view of other al Qaeda members was

   5   that while Americans were an enemy because they were

   6   preventing true Islamic government from taking over that there

   7   was no intention of attacking Americans, isn't that correct?

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.  His view and

   9   other members' views.

  10            THE COURT:  Overruled.  Follow up.

  11   A.  Can you repeat the answer and your question.

  12   Q.  Isn't it a fact that -- withdrawn.

  13            Could you repeat that question, please.

  14            (Record read)

  15   A.  Well, the intention of attacking wasn't in the beginning.

  16   Q.  In the beginning meaning the first time that you were in

  17   Afghanistan, is that correct?

  18   A.  Even further.

  19   Q.  And the time that you were in the Sudan; is that correct?

  20   A.  I realized that when I saw people coming to make

  21   surveillance in Kenya that they might to do something in the

  22   future.

  23   Q.  So didn't you say that the first time that the real

  24   animosity against the US started after Mr. Bin Laden went to

  25   Sudan?



                                                                1461

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Well, after he left the Sudan he started issuing that

   2   various statement about the United States.

   3   Q.  That's the first time where you had any inkling that Bin

   4   Laden would ever do anything like what happened in 1998, isn't

   5   that right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  When Mr. Bin Laden went back to Afghanistan you remained

   8   in the Sudan; is that right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  But you heard from people who still remained in the Sudan

  11   many things that were going on with Mr. Bin Laden and al

  12   Qaeda; is that right?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  And it seemed to you what you were learning was that some

  15   members of the Egyptian jihad were gaining influence over

  16   Mr. Bin Laden, is that right?

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to competence, the same

  18   one made on direct.

  19            THE COURT:  Restate your question.

  20   Q.  You heard from people who still were al Qaeda members that

  21   people like Sawa Hiri was gaining influence over Bin Laden

  22   Afghanistan, didn't you?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Same objection.

  24            THE COURT:  I would permit a yes or no to that.

  25   Q.  You may answer.



                                                                1462

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Now, Mr. Bin Laden -- withdrawn.

   3            Now, was it after Mr. Bin Laden issued the fatwa

   4   concerning Saudi Arabia from Afghanistan in 1996, was it --

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'll start over again, your Honor.

   7   Q.  Was it al Qaeda -- did you hear from people who were in al

   8   Qaeda that Bin Laden's fatwa was a fatwa issued from

   9   Afghanistan concerning Saudi Arabia was an attempt to become a

  10   popular figure in Saudi Arabia?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form again.

  12            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  13   Q.  When did you first hear about the Saudi Arabian --

  14   withdrawn.  When did you first hear of the fatwa issued

  15   concerning Saudi Arabia from Afghanistan?

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form again, if your

  17   Honor, please.

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  Withdrawn.

  19   Q.  Did you ever hear about the fatwa from Afghanistan

  20   concerning Saudi Arabia?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, again.

  22            THE COURT:  It's the last phrase that you're

  23   objecting to?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  25            THE COURT:  Sustained.



                                                                1463

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  When was the first time that you heard a fatwa issued out

   2   of Afghanistan?

   3   A.  General fatwa?

   4   Q.  General fatwa.

   5   A.  The end of '96 I think.

   6   Q.  Was that about Saudi Arabia?

   7   A.  If I remember it was about United States.

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  It was about the United States troops in Saudi Arabia?

   2   A.  They are using the presence of United States in Saudi

   3   Arabia so as to issue this fatwah.  It was not the reason.

   4   Q.  It was basically to try to effect a change in the

   5   government of Saudi Arabia, is that right?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, your Honor.  Competence.

   7            THE COURT:  You can ask him whether he was familiar

   8   with the fatwah, what its contents were, and whether that was

   9   one of the objects stated in the fatwah as its objective.

  10   Q.  Did you talk with anybody who was a member of Al Qaeda

  11   after you heard about the fatwah issued from Afghanistan?

  12   A.  Probably, yes.

  13   Q.  Do you remember the conversation that you had with that

  14   person or persons?

  15   A.  There was no many people there of Al Qaeda in Sudan at

  16   that time.

  17   Q.  Do you remember what their reaction to that fatwah was?

  18            THE COURT:  You know, a statement by some

  19   unidentified member of Al Qaeda doesn't necessarily constitute

  20   the policy of Al Qaeda.  You can ask him whether he read it,

  21   whether he was familiar with the contents, whether he

  22   discussed the contents with anyone else.

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I am not asking whether it

  24   represents the, quote, Al Qaeda position, but only --

  25            THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.  Move on,



                                                                1465

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   please.

   2   Q.  When you were in the Sudan during your two, three or four

   3   weeks visits from Kenya and after you returned to the Sudan,

   4   you went, sometimes you went to weekly discussions at Al Qaeda

   5   guesthouse, is that correct?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  The guesthouse that it was usually held in -- withdrawn.

   8            They were Thursday evening meetings?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  After prayer?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  The guesthouse they were usually held in was the one

  13   called the Saudi guesthouse.

  14   A.  I have never heard this name.

  15   Q.  It's a guesthouse where many Saudis used to stay, and it

  16   had a big room and it was in the Riyadh section.

  17   A.  Yes, but its name was guesthouse.  There is no Saudi.  OK.

  18   Q.  These Thursday meetings were not mandatory, were they?

  19   A.  Yes.  They weren't mandatory, yes.

  20   Q.  But you usually went anyway.

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  You never saw the person who was depicted in the

  23   photograph that I showed you, Defendant's Exhibit, WEH Exhibit

  24   C, you never saw that person at any of those meetings, is that

  25   correct?



                                                                1466

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Which person, the first one you showed me?

   2   Q.  The photograph that you looked at.

   3   A.  No.

   4   Q.  At these guesthouse meetings, it was an opportunity to see

   5   people that you may have not seen for a while, is that right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  And you discussed news, both what's happening in the

   8   Sudan, international news?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  There were sometimes lectures about the ways of the

  11   prophet?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  There was actually a Koran memorization program that was

  14   given at the guesthouses?

  15   A.  Some people who are visiting there, not like me who are

  16   traveling, they have that program.

  17   Q.  But most of the lectures, the religious lectures and the

  18   sermons, were not given at the guesthouse, they were given in

  19   local mosques; is that right?

  20   A.  Some in local mosques, some in guesthouse.

  21   Q.  There was a religious committee in Al Qaeda, is that

  22   right?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Was it the opinion of many members of Al Qaeda that the

  25   religious committee did not have a very high status?



                                                                1467

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Excuse me. (Interpreted)

   2            THE INTERPRETER:  He is asking for more clarification

   3   of the question.

   4   Q.  Would it be fair to say that when Bin Laden, or Al Qaeda

   5   was looking for religious clarifications of -- withdrawn.

   6            Would it be fair to say that when Al Qaeda or Mr. Bin

   7   Laden were looking for clarification of religious issues, that

   8   he often spoke with scholars in Saudi Arabia?

   9   A.  Yes, if they are big issues, he has to bring something

  10   from the scholars, yes.

  11   Q.  And while there were some learned, some people who had

  12   memorized the Koran who were living in the Sudan, they were

  13   not considered high enough scholars at times, is that right?

  14   A.  Yes.  As I said, there is a big difference between

  15   somebody who memorized the Koran and scholar.  Scholar is very

  16   top in not only Koran but in sharia, in the prophet life and

  17   in other things.

  18   Q.  So for somebody to be able to issue a fatwah, they have to

  19   really be a great scholar.

  20   A.  He has to be, yes.

  21   Q.  And there was really nobody in the Sudan that would fit

  22   that category of a great scholar, is that correct?

  23   A.  To my knowledge, Abu Ibrahim al Iraqi, for example, he has

  24   some skill, but the others, they are not, they don't have the

  25   level.



                                                                1468

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  Abu Ibrahim often lectured at the mosques on Friday night,

   2   didn't he?

   3   A.  It's not Friday night.  It's during the Friday prayer.

   4   It's 1:00.

   5   Q.  I apologize.  It was on Friday, though, after the 1:00

   6   prayer -- withdrawn.

   7            On Fridays after the communal prayer, is that when

   8   there were lectures?

   9   A.  Yes, he was doing the lecturing this prayer.

  10   Q.  In Islam, the one time where it is very important to try

  11   to have communal prayers is on Friday, is that correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And often because there are communal prayers, someone will

  14   speak or give a sermon after the prayers.

  15   A.  It's before the prayer.

  16   Q.  I am sorry, before the prayer.  Thank you.  And people

  17   like Ibrahim al Iraqi spoke often at the communal, before the

  18   communal prayers on Friday.

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Abu Hajer al Iraqi, he also spoke sometimes on Fridays

  21   before the communal prayers.

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  But they didn't always speak at the same mosque, they

  24   often spoke at different mosques around town, is that right?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                1469

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  And the mosques in Khartoum were mosques that were open to

   2   the public and to different people and different groups.

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  So at these mosques there weren't just Al Qaeda people,

   5   there were Al Qaeda people and other people as well.

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  It was a public forum.

   8   A.  It's public, yes.

   9   Q.  When Abu Hajer spoke, he usually spoke about ethics and

  10   morals and not politics, is that correct?

  11   A.  Generally, yes.

  12   Q.  Members of Al Qaeda were free to go to any particular

  13   mosque for their Friday communal prayers, isn't that right?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  So there was no requirement, say, today Abu Hajer is

  16   speaking at this mosque, we all must go to this mosque.  There

  17   was nothing like that.

  18   A.  No.

  19   Q.  When you took a bayat with Al Qaeda, did you have a piece

  20   of paper to read or a document to read?

  21   A.  Yes, it was a paper, yes.

  22   Q.  Did you also discuss that with people, members of Al

  23   Qaeda?

  24   A.  At that time maybe.

  25   Q.  Do you recall that one of the conditions of being a member


<P>                                                                1470

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   of Al Qaeda was that you could not join any other Islamic

   2   organizations?

   3   A.  You can do it only if you leave that group.

   4   Q.  That's correct.

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  So if you were from another group and you joined Al Qaeda,

   7   you had to leave the group that you belonged to?

   8   A.  Because you can't work under two bosses.

   9   Q.  And because the different bosses of the different groups

  10   often had very different philosophies, isn't that right?

  11   A.  Sometimes, yes.

  12   Q.  And if you wanted to join another group you would have to

  13   seek permission to leave Al Qaeda.

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Do you remember when you were asked by the government that

  16   if you violated your bayat when you decided not to go to

  17   Afghanistan?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And do you remember saying that you did because what was

  20   asked of you was not unIslamic?

  21   A.  Excuse me.  Can you repeat again.

  22   Q.  Do you remember that you answered that yes, you did break

  23   your bayat because what they asked you to do, to go to

  24   Afghanistan, was normal and not unIslamic?

  25   A.  No.  I think you -- I didn't say that.  I said I have been



                                                                1471

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   asked to go to Afghanistan and they didn't agree, and it's

   2   normally a breaking of the bayat and it's a sin, but it's not

   3   Islamic.

   4   Q.  But part of your bayat was that the leadership of Al Qaeda

   5   would not ask you to do something that was not Islamic, isn't

   6   that correct?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And the determination of what is not Islamic or unIslamic

   9   falls on the individual Sunni Muslim, doesn't it?

  10   A.  You want to know what is Islamic or not Islamic.

  11   Q.  Yes.

  12   A.  If he ask me, for example, to do something that is against

  13   Islam, in this way I should disobey him.

  14   Q.  And it is your responsibility as a Sunni Muslim to make

  15   that determination as to whether what you were asked is

  16   Islamic or not Islamic.

  17   A.  If you know what you are doing it's OK.  If you don't

  18   know, you have to ask.

  19   Q.  You were supposed to ultimately make the decision.

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And you are allowed to speak to other scholars to help you

  22   make a decision?

  23   A.  Yes.  You should speak to them, yes.

  24   Q.  In fact, it is so strong for you to make that decision

  25   that you have a religious obligation to always make a



                                                                1472

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   determination of what you are asked to do is, whether it is

   2   Islamic or nonIslamic.

   3   A.  You should know, yes.

   4   Q.  And if you determined that you were being asked to do

   5   something nonIslamic, you can say no without violating your

   6   bayat; isn't that right?

   7   A.  I can say no, yes.

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  May I have one moment, your Honor?

   9            I have no further questions.  Thank you.

  10            THE COURT:  Who else?

  12            THE COURT:  Mr. Wilford for the defendant Odeh.

  17   BY MR. WILFORD:

  18   Q.  Good afternoon, Mr. Kherchtou.

  19   A.  Good afternoon.

  20   Q.  Is that the correct pronunciation of your name?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  You met, isn't it correct, with American officials several

  24   well-deserved reputation as brutal thugs or --

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.



                                                                1477

   1            THE COURT:  Yes, sustained.

   2   Q.  You did, sir, have an opportunity to bribe the Kenyan

   3   police yourself?

   4   A.  Through an attorney.

   5   Q.  Right.  You didn't pay the bribe personally to a

   6   particular police officer, you went to the lawyer, the lawyer

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Could you please tell us who they were, those three people



                                                                1478

   1   that were arrested.

   2   A.  Abdel Hameed, Khalid Fawwaz, and Abu Ammar.

   3   Q.  Hamad was released rather quickly, once you paid the

  11   before he was released?

  12   A.  Between two and four months.

  13   Q.  And the third person was held how long?

  14   A.  The first two were released together, and it's the third

  15   one that remained between two to four months.

  16   Q.  And that's despite the fact that you paid the bribe,

  17   right?

  18   A.  The bribe was for Abdel Hameed and Khalid Fawwaz only.

  19   Q.  Sir, when you were involved in this process of paying a

  20   bribe, isn't it a fact that you went to the precinct, the

  21   police station, with a lawyer?

  22   A.  We went with him later on, not the day that we paid the

  23   bribe.

  24   Q.  I understand that, but you did in fact go to the precinct

  25   with an attorney, is that correct?



                                                                1479

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  And the reason that you went, even contacted an attorney

   3   and went to the precinct with an attorney is because you

   4   received a phone call from one of your brothers informing you

   5   that they had been arrested; isn't that correct?

   6   A.  I went with Khalid Fawwaz to the jail to ask about Abdul

   7   Hameed, and there they arrested Khalid Fawwaz.

   8   Q.  You went to the jail because you received a phone call

   9   from the first person who was arrested, telling you that they

  10   had been arrested; isn't that correct?

  11   A.  No.

  12   Q.  Tell me what happened, sir.

  13   A.  Through her?

  14   Q.  Yes, please.

  15   A.  Initially when I first learned that Abdul Hameed was

  16   arrested --

  17   Q.  Can I just stop you right there for a moment.  How did you

  18   learn that Hameed had been arrested?

  19   A.  From the neighbors.

  20   Q.  From the neighbors.

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  You never received a phone call?

  23   A.  Never.

  24   Q.  Did you make a phone call concerning the arrest?

  25   A.  I contacted by telephone Khalid Fawwaz to tell him about



                                                                1480

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   the arrest and I couldn't find him initially.  Then later on

   2   when I found him, I told him about the arrest.

   3   Q.  When did you contact the lawyer?

   4   A.  The following day when I went with Khalid Fawwaz to the

   5   jail, or to the prison, and he was arrested, he told me to

   6   contact a lawyer.

   7   Q.  By the way, what was the amount of this bribe that was

   8   paid?

   9   A.  $3,000.

  10   Q.  Sir, I believe that you told the jury that you were raised

  11   in the Muslim faith, is that correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And it would be fair to say that you are familiar with the

  14   traditional greeting that one Muslim brother would give to

  15   another upon seeing him, is that correct?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  Would it be fair to say, sir, that the greeting is in fact

  18   one where you embrace each other, is that correct?

  19   A.  It depends.  It depends on what country you are from.

  20   Q.  Has it been your experience while you were a member of Al

  21   Qaeda for other members of Al Qaeda, for other brothers of Al

  22   Qaeda to greet each other in an embrace?

  23   A.  Sometimes yes, especially if he has come back from a trip.

  24   Q.  Especially if it is somebody that you knew well, isn't

  25   that correct?



                                                                1481

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  That embrace would involve a hug, am I correct?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And it also would involve from the left side of the head,

   5   right, putting your head on the left side and on the right

   6   side, is that correct, with the cheeks touching; isn't that

   7   correct?

   8   A.  Sometimes not always.

   9   Q.  Not always, but in these instances that I am talking

  10   about, it would be an embrace and a hug, and three times on

  11   the left side, three times on the right side; is that not

  12   correct?

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  14            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  15   A.  Sometimes.  It depends on what country you are from.

  16   Other times you just shake hands.

  17   Q.  I am talking about those times when you do the embrace.

  18   Is it as I have described?

  19   A.  It could be.  Possible.

  20   Q.  Sir, have you ever greeted one of your brothers in that

  21   fashion?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  In 1991, you traveled to Afghanistan, is that correct?

  24            THE INTERPRETER:  Pardon me.

  25   Q.  In 1991 you traveled to Afghanistan, is that correct?



                                                                1482

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   A.  Correct.

   2   Q.  It was your understanding as a Muslim that it was your

   3   obligation and duty to go to Afghanistan and participate in

   4   the fight against the Soviets.

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Sir, when you arrived in Afghanistan, isn't it a fact that

   7   all of your travel documents were taken from you?

   8   A.  Nobody took it from me by force.  I handed it over to an

   9   office.

  10   Q.  It was a requirement that you surrender your travel

  11   documents, isn't that correct?

  12   A.  Just so that it would not get lost in the camp.

  13   Q.  Sir, did you get your travel documents back?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  And you didn't get them back until you left Afghanistan,

  16   isn't that correct?

  17   A.  Almost.

  18   Q.  Almost correct?

  19   A.  I don't quite recall exactly when I got back my travel

  20   documents.

  21   Q.  So it's not almost, you just don't know when you got them

  22   back.

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Sir, you said that you knew this gentleman, Mohamed Odeh,

  25   from Afghanistan, isn't that correct?



                                                                1483

   3   spent in the Khost area camps, isn't that correct?

   4   A.  In which camp?

   5   Q.  Didn't you tell the jury that it was from the al Farouq

   6   calm?  Isn't that what you told the jury?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  Isn't it a fact that you had traveled to Afghanistan with

   9   a veterinarian who Mr. Fitzgerald referred to as the animal

  10   doctor; isn't that correct?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Sir, isn't it a fact that when your friend the

  13   veterinarian left al Farouq camp, that Mohamed Odeh became

  14   medical officer for that camp?

  15   A.  Would you kindly repeat the question again.

  16   Q.  Certainly.  Isn't it a fact, sir, that when your friend

  17   the veterinarian left al Farouq camp, that Mohamed Odeh became

  18   the medical officer for that camp?

  19   A.  I do not recall that he became the doctor.

  20   Q.  Not the doctor, but he was the person who was responsible

  21   for assisting people medically, isn't that correct?

  22   A.  I do not recall, but it could very well be so.

  23   Q.  That's something that you may not know, right?

  24   A.  That's true, I do not know.

  25   Q.  Sir, when you went to Afghanistan, how many years did you



                                                                1484

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   remain in Afghanistan?

   2   A.  It could very well be '91 and '92.

   3   Q.  And, sir, when did you first learn of Al Qaeda?

   4   A.  I learned about it in the camp, but after I graduate from

   5   the Farouq.

   6   Q.  That was sometime in mid-to late 1992, isn't that correct?

   7   A.  It was right after I finished my training and it could

   8   have very well been in April 1992.

  17   BY MR. WILFORD:

  18   Q.  Mr. Kherchtou, I believe when we took the break we were

  19   discussing when it was that you first went to Afghanistan,

  20   isn't that correct?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Sir, you informed the jury that you first learned about Al

  23   Qaeda when you had completed your time in the camp around

  24   April of 1992, is that correct?

  25   A.  April 1991.



                                                                1486

   1   Q.  1991.

   2   A.  Correct.

   3   Q.  You are positive about that date?

   4   A.  Exactly.

   5   Q.  Isn't it a fact, sir, that at the time that you learned

   6   about Al Qaeda you were informed of the full name of Al Qaeda;

   7   isn't that correct?

   8   A.  When I took my bayat, they explained to me what is the Al

   9   Qaeda and all the details pertaining to it.

  10   Q.  Did they tell you the full name of Al Qaeda?

  11   A.  Up till now I only know that it is the Qaeda.

  12   Q.  And that means the base.

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Sir, when you found out about Al Qaeda in 1991, isn't it a

  15   fact that members of Al Qaeda had already gone to Somalia?

  16   A.  At that time I did not know that.

  17   Q.  You found out later though, isn't that correct?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And you knew that they had gone there sometime in 1991,

  20   isn't that correct?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Isn't it also a fact, sir, that it is your understanding

  23   that the members of Al Qaeda who went to Somalia went there

  24   with religious justification?

  25   A.  Yes.



                                                                1487

   1   Q.  Sir, I just want to digress for one moment.  You were

   2   asked some questions by Mr. Schmidt concerning the Shiite and

   3   Sunni Muslims, isn't that correct?  Do you remember those?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Sir, would it be fair to say that the difference between

   6   the Sunni Muslim and the Shiite Muslims is fundamental?

   7   A.  There is a difference in certain things.

   8   Q.  And it is a very deep difference, isn't that correct?

   9   A.  It's very difficult to understand -- it will be very

  10   difficult for you to understand the difference.

  11   Q.  I wouldn't understand it because I'm not Muslim, is that

  12   correct?

  13   A.  Correct.

  14   Q.  But it would be fair to say that even though I'm not

  15   Muslim, that you can tell this jury that there are some very

  16   basic differences between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.

  17   A.  Possibly I can explain.

  18   Q.  You said possibly you can explain?

  19   A.  Yes, I can.

  20   Q.  Would you like to have the opportunity to explain?

  21   A.  The difference between the Sunni and the Shiite is the

  22   prophesy.  It's the prophesy that came down, descended from

  23   heaven.

  24   Q.  Thank you.

  25   A.  Excuse me.  It wasn't finished yet.



                                                                1488

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Q.  I am sorry.

   2   A.  It's a long story.  Do you want me to go on?

   3   Q.  No, I don't want the long story.  There are differences in

   4   the beliefs of the Sunni and the Shiite and they are very

   5   difficult for them to get along because of those differences;

   6   is that a fair statement?

   7   A.  That is true.

   8   Q.  When you left Afghanistan, you went to the Sudan with

   9   other members of Al Qaeda including Bin Laden, is that

  10   correct?

  11   A.  When I left Afghanistan I went to Kenya, and from Kenya to

  12   Sudan.

  13   Q.  So you went to Kenya first?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  You lived in Kenya for two years and then you went to the

  16   Sudan?

  17   A.  No.  I have mentioned before that I went to Kenya, I

  18   stayed there for a short period of time, and from there I went

  19   on to the Sudan.

  20   Q.  And when you finally arrived in the Sudan, you were there

  21   with Al Qaeda, Bin Laden, and the other members of Al Qaeda,

  22   isn't that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Sir, would it be fair to say that Bin Laden as a person

  25   almost became a symbol, an entity in the Arab world, in the



                                                                1489

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   Muslim world?  Would that be fair to say?

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Can we have a time frame?

   3            MR. WILFORD:  Certainly.

   4   Q.  By the time you had arrived in the Sudan, by the time Bin

   5   Laden arrived in the Sudan, would it be fair to say that he

   6   was a symbol to the Muslim world?

   7   A.  After he had left Sudan, he became a symbol to the Muslim

   8   world.

   9   Q.  Not when he was in the Sudan?

  10   A.  When he was in Sudan, not that many people heard of him.

  11   Q.  Sir, isn't it a fact that Bin Laden, as far as you knew,

  12   entered into agreements with a number of organizations and

  13   persons that were personal to him and had nothing to do with

  14   the membership of Al Qaeda?

  15            THE INTERPRETER:  Excuse me, can you kindly repeat,

  16   because it's a long sentence to remember without having a

  17   notebook.

  18            MR. WILFORD:  Would you like some paper?

  19            THE INTERPRETER:  No, it's OK.

  20   Q.  Isn't it a fact that Bin Laden entered into agreements

  21   with a number of organizations and persons that were personal

  22   to him and had nothing to do with the membership of Al Qaeda?

  23   A.  This happened after he had gone to Afghanistan.

  24   Q.  Isn't it a fact, sir, that the goals of Bin Laden and the

  25   goals of the membership of Al Qaeda were not synonymous at all



                                                                1490

                              Kherchtou - cross

   1   times?

   2   A.  That is true.

   3   Q.  Would it be fair to say that the goals of Bin Laden

   4   evolved in a different direction over time?

   5   A.  That is true.

   6   Q.  And would it be fair, sir, to say that the membership of

   7   Al Qaeda did not share those views as they evolved in a more

   8   and more radical direction?

   9   A.  At the beginning, yes.

  10   Q.  Isn't it a fact that members of Al Qaeda openly disagreed

  11   with Bin Laden as well as each other?

  12   A.  Sometimes, yes.

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   Q.  Now, when these disagreements occurred they were based

   2   upon whether or not Bin Laden's actions or decisions were

   3   Islamically correct.  Isn't that a fact?

   4            THE INTERPRETER:  Can you kindly repeat the question,

   5   again?

   6   Q.  Yes.  When these disagreements occurred, isn't it a fact

   7   that they were based upon whether or not the actions and

   8   decisions of Bin Laden were determined to be Islamically

   9   correct?

  10   A.  These decisions were, it is not in accordance with Islam,

  11   yes.

  12   Q.  For instance, the killing of children, women and innocent

  13   civilians is not Islamically correct, isn't that a fact?

  14   A.  That is correct.

  15   Q.  And if Bin Laden or anyone else issued a fatwa that

  16   involved the killing of women, children and innocent civilians

  17   you wouldn't be a part of that.  Is that correct?

  18   A.  That's true, I would not agree with.

  19   Q.  And there were many other members of al Qaeda who would

  20   not have agreed to participate or accepted any such fatwas?

  21   A.  Everybody would look into his faith.  If one believes that

  22   this is not in accordance with Islam, so everyone depends on

  23   his faith.

  24   Q.  Well, sir, I understand that, but I want to ask you again.

  25   Isn't it a fact that there were a lot of members of al Qaeda



                                                                1492

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   who did not accept any fatwa that directed the killing of

   2   innocent women, children and civilians?

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to foundation, your Honor.

   4            THE COURT:  Ask him if he knows.

   5   Q.  Do you know that to be true, sir?

   6   A.  This fatwa appeared or came about after they went to

   7   Afghanistan.  The number of the people who were present in

   8   Sudan was, very, very limited, very, very small.  So that was

   9   not an indication that they were against Bin Laden or his

  10   fatwas.

  11   Q.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear the last part.

  12   A.  This was not an indication that they were against Bin

  13   Laden or his fatwas.

  14   Q.  Sir, isn't it a fact that when you were being questioned

  15   by American agents you told them that there were many members

  16   of al Qaeda who would not volunteer to follow fatwa that

  17   involved the killing of innocent civilians.  Isn't that a

  18   fact?

  19   A.  I said they would not be in agreement with this fatwa

  20   because this is against Islam.

  21   Q.  They would not?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  There came a time did it not that you left al Qaeda?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  When you were a part of al Qaeda you knew, however, that



                                                                1493

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   secrecy was an integral part of al Qaeda?

   2   A.  Correct.

   3   Q.  And isn't it a fact that people in al Qaeda wouldn't know

   4   what other people who were members of al Qaeda were doing,

   5   although they were all members of al Qaeda?

   6   A.  Sometimes.

   7   Q.  Isn't it a fact that there is or was no hierarchical

   8   structure to al Qaeda?

   9   A.  There was, there was.

  10   Q.  I'm sorry?

  11   A.  There was hierarchy in al Qaeda.

  12   Q.  There was?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Did you ever tell the authorities that you were speaking

  15   to that there was none?

  16   A.  What do you mean by hierarchy?

  17   Q.  Somebody at the top, somebody at the bottom.

  18   A.  Initially when one saw the hierarchy, one just kept quiet

  19   because one was serving God.

  20   Q.  Now, sir, isn't it a fact that Mr. Odeh engaged in the

  21   fishing business in Kenya to support himself?

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, foundation.

  23            THE COURT:  Yes.  Does he know.

  24   Q.  Well, sir, is it a fact that that's what you told the

  25   American authorities when you were interviewed that Mr. Odeh



                                                                1494

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   engage in the fishing business in Kenya to support himself?

   2   A.  To support himself and others in Mombasa.

   3   Q.  And it's the obligation of one Muslim to help another

   4   Muslim, isn't that correct?

   5   A.  Correct.

   6   Q.  Now, sir, did you tell the jury that you left al Qaeda

   7   because of refusal to pay for medical bills that had been

   8   incurred by your wife?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Sir, isn't it a fact that you signed a document declaring

  11   that you had left al Qaeda?

  12   A.  It was a document stating that I got all my rights from al

  13   Qaeda and that they owe me nothing.

  14   Q.  Isn't it a fact that after you signed that document you

  15   still maintained contact with people who were members of al

  16   Qaeda?

  17   A.  Correct, because a friendship between myself and members

  18   of al Qaeda continued.

  19   Q.  And isn't it a fact that when you traveled to Kenya from

  20   the Sudan that you met with members of al Qaeda in June of

  21   1998?

  22   A.  I met only with Harun.

  23   Q.  Harun was a member of al Qaeda, isn't that correct?

  24   A.  Yes, Harun, yes, is a member of al Qaeda.

  25   Q.  And you met with him to talk with him, isn't that correct?



                                                                1495

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  Did you meet with Kawhil at that time?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And isn't it a fact that when you returned to Kenya in

   5   August of 1998 you sought to meet with members of al Qaeda?

   6            THE INTERPRETER:  199O?

   7   Q.  '8.  August of 1998.

   8   A.  Saw or visited with?

   9   Q.  You were trying to find a room, isn't that correct?

  10   A.  Correct.

  11   Q.  And you did in fact meet with a member of al Qaeda on the

  12   very day that the United States embassy was bombed, isn't that

  13   correct?

  14   A.  No, I did not meet anybody.

  15   Q.  You didn't meet with anybody?

  16   A.  Met somebody from al Quaeda?

  17   Q.  Well, who did you meet with on the day that the United

  18   States embassy was bombed?

  19   A.  Ahmed Sawil came to me at the hotel.

  20   Q.  And Sawil is an associate of al Qaeda, isn't that correct?

  21   A.  No, he's not a member of al Qaeda.

  22   Q.  I didn't ask if he was a member.  I asked if he was an

  23   associate.  Did he do things with members of al Qaeda?

  24   A.  Yes, he does have friends in al Qaeda.

  25   Q.  Didn't you call Harun on the day that the embassy was



                                                                1496

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   bombed?

   2   A.  The evening of the, the evening.  It happened on Thursday

   3   and the embassy was bombed on Friday.

   4   Q.  So you called the night before?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  When you met with Sawil on the day of the bombing you were

   7   very afraid, weren't you?

   8   A.  Yes, that something normal.

   9   Q.  And you weren't afraid because you had done anything

  10   wrong, were you?

  11   A.  That's correct, but my presence in this country was drive

  12   me to be afraid.

  13   Q.  Well, you didn't know about the bombing before it

  14   occurred, did you?

  15   A.  If I had known I would not have gone there.

  16   Q.  So the answer is no then.

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And you didn't participate in the bombing, did you?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Yet you were still afraid, isn't that correct?

  21   A.  Correct.

  22   Q.  And isn't it a fact that the reason that you were afraid

  23   is that you believed your very association with al Qaeda

  24   members, even though you yourself were no longer a member, was

  25   enough to cast suspicion on you such that you would be subject



                                                                1497

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   to arrest or worse at the hands of the Kenya authorities?

   2   A.  That is true.

   3   Q.  Now, sir, when you were arrested and detained in Kenya

   4   yourself, and you spoke with a member of a foreign service

   5   isn't that correct that was neither Kenyan or American, isn't

   6   that correct?

   7            THE INTERPRETER:  That was neither Kenyan nor

   8   American?

   9            MR. WILFORD:  Yes.

  10   A.  Correct.

  11   Q.  And, sir, when you spoke with that individual isn't it a

  12   fact that that interview was recorded?

  13   A.  Yes, it was recorded, that is true.

  14   Q.  You saw the tape recorder sitting right in front of you as

  15   you were talking to this individual, isn't that correct?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  Now, sir, when you were being questioned at a later time

  18   by American officials this questioning took place over a

  19   period of days, if not weeks, isn't that correct?

  20   A.  Almost two weeks.

  21   Q.  And during that two-week time period while you were being

  22   questioned, hypothetical questions were being posed to you,

  23   isn't that correct?

  24   A.  A lot of questions.

  25   Q.  Well, they were asking you a lot of questions that were



                                                                1498

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   asking you to suppose a particular fact, and then give an

   2   answer.  Isn't that correct?

   3   A.  The questions were many, many questions and they were not

   4   hypothetical.  They were concentrating on the incident and the

   5   events and facts themselves.

   6   Q.  Well, were you asked a question, could Bin Laden have been

   7   involved in a bombing in Yemen?  Wasn't that a hypothetical

   8   question, sir?

   9            THE COURT:  Oh, no, let's not.

  10            MR. WILFORD:  Okay, I'll move on, Judge, no problem.

  11   Q.  Sir, you were asked that question, though, weren't you?

  12   A.  The question that was posed that could not or hypothetical

  13   is, did you hear anything special about the incident in Yemen.

  14   Q.  Didn't they go further and ask you, not only did you hear

  15   anything, but could Bin Laden have been involved?

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, your Honor.

  17            THE COURT:  No, I'll allow it.  Was he asked that

  18   question.

  19   A.  I don't precisely remember the questions.  I believe that

  20   they have the questions written down.  I don't recall the

  21   exact question.

  22   Q.  By the way, when you were speaking with the Americans did

  23   you see any tape recorder?

  24   A.  No.

  25   Q.  I want to turn, if I might, back to when you were a member



                                                                1499

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   of al Qaeda and living in Kenya.

   2            There was a time that Abu Hafs, Abu al Amakkee, Abu

   3   al Amriki, Anas al Liby --

   4            THE INTERPRETER:  Excuse me.  There is nobody by the

   5   name of Abu Amriki according to him.

   6   Q.  Ali Mohammed.

   7   A.  Abu Amriki is the father of the American.  There is nobody

   8   by that name.

   9   Q.  Okay.  Then let's do it this way.  There was a time when

  10   five people came to visit you while you had an apartment in

  11   Nairobi, right?

  12   A.  Five people came to Nairobi, not five of them came to

  13   visit me at one time.

  14   Q.  Okay, good.  Could you tell the jury the other four people

  15   besides Abu Hafs who came to Nairobi?

  16   A.  Abu half el Masry, Abu Amriki, Anas al Liby, Hamza al

  17   Liby.

  18   Q.  Now, of those five people three of them came to your

  19   apartment and developed pictures during the day, isn't that

  20   correct?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Could you tell the jury who these three people were?

  23   A.  Abu Al Amriki, Anas al Liby, Hamza al Liby.

  24   Q.  Did Abu Hafs and Fadal Makkee ever come to your apartment?

  25            THE INTERPRETER:  Came to?



<P>                                                               1500

   1            MR. WILFORD:  His apartment.

   2   A.  They came at different times.

   3   Q.  But the fact is that they came to your apartment during

   4   the day and they stayed at a hotel at night.  Isn't that

   5   correct?

   6   A.  They came and it was lunchtime, we had lunch together.

   7   Q.  And they didn't just have a lunch, right?  They developed

   8   pictures in your apartment.  Isn't that correct?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.  Specify who?

  10            THE COURT:  Yes.

  11            MR. WILFORD:  I'm sorry.

  12            THE COURT:  It's not clear who you're questioning

  13   about now.

  14   Q.  The three people who did the surveillance came to your

  15   apartment in the daytime, they didn't just have lunch, they

  16   developed the pictures in your apartment, isn't that correct?

  17   A.  You asked me before Abu Hafs Amriki and Abu al Amriki

  18   initially and I told you, yes they came and they had, we, they

  19   had lunch with me.  And then you asked me about, and you asked

  20   me prior to that about the three others.

  21   Q.  So now, sir, I'm asking you about the three people who

  22   took pictures and had developed them in your apartment.

  23   That's what they did, isn't that correct?

  24   A.  That's correct.

  25   Q.  And when they finished developing the pictures they went



                                                                1501

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   to a hotel and that's where they stayed, isn't that correct?

   2   A.  That is correct.

   3   Q.  And that was where they slept of night?  No one slept in

   4   your apartment.  They stayed in a hotel, isn't that correct?

   5   A.  For one reason, there was no space.

   6   Q.  For whatever reason, they stayed in a hotel?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8            MR. WILFORD:  Thank you.  Nothing further.

   9            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll call it a day then.

  10   We're adjourned until tomorrow morning.

   1            (Jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald, you sent the Court a copy

   3   of a letter dated February 22, and counsel, with respect to

   4   articles you plan to offer and requesting that if there were

   5   any objections you'd be advised by Friday.  Did you receive

   6   any objections?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  I've sent a lot of letters, Judge.

   8   Was it signed by my name or my colleague's name?

   9            MR. KARAS:  Relating to articles appearing in Al-Quds

  10   al-Arabi.  No, your Honor, there have been no objections.  We

  11   have the stipulation ready to go on the February 98.

  12            THE COURT:  All right.

  13            MR. COHN:  I have a couple of motions in limine which

  14   are not rocket science, but we should take up that morning

  15   whenever that is.

  16            THE COURT:  I understand you want to confer with your

  17   client and the Marshal permitted you to confer with your

  18   client.

  19            MR. COHN:  I just wanted to advise the Court.

  20            THE COURT:  Anything that I should take up now?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  One second.

  22            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, the only thing that we don't

  23   need to take up now but we wanted to advise the Court we have

  24   not been able to work out a stipulation with respect to a

  25   witness that will authenticate the documents taken from El



                                                                1503

                          Kherchtou - cross/Wilford

   1   Hage's computer.  Depending on who that witness is going to be

   2   we may be making an in limine motion as soon as we determine

   3   that, which we hope to do at the end of today.  We will advise

   4   of course counsel and the Court.

   5            THE COURT:  Very well.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'm waiting for information from the

   7   government to make a determination if I am going to make in

   8   limine motion as to one of the documents the government is

   9   going to produce.

  10            THE COURT:  All right.  Great expectations, but

  11   nothing that is presently ripe for ajudication.  We're

  12   adjourned until tomorrow.
