   1            (Trial resumed)

   2            THE COURT:  Before I bring in the jury, is there any

   3   matter that has to be taken up?

   4            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I just want to express to

   5   the court and the government what I plan to do in

   6   cross-examination related to possible classified documents.  I

   7   don't think that the cross-examination itself is going to be

   8   an issue, but the answers of the witness may present issues,

   9   and I want to present that to the court.  I set forth my

  10   position in my letter last week.

  11            THE COURT:  You are alerting the court to your

  12   reservation of a right subsequent to the conclusion of the

  13   cross-examination of the witness to renew applications with

  14   respect to discovery or declassification of material that you

  15   have been furnished?  Is that your concern?

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I don't know that it would

  17   be appropriate to call it reserving my rights under it.  I

  18   raised this issue before.  I plan to go into some questions,

  19   and I think that that already entails some CIPA issues, and I

  20   want to make sure that there is no violation of CIPA by my

  21   questioning.

  22            THE COURT:  When the parties were last before the

  23   court, which I believe was last Thursday morning, I restated

  24   very explicitly what I believed the procedures to be with

  25   respect to cross-examination of the witness and any reference


 
                                                                874



   1   to material which the government stated was classified.  You

   2   have read those.

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

   4            THE COURT:  Very well.  We will proceed on that

   5   basis, and if you have an application to make after you have

   6   completed your cross and before resumption of redirect, if

   7   there is to be any redirect, I will give you an opportunity to

   8   address the court.

   9            (Jury present)

  10            THE COURT:  Good morning.  I hope you all enjoyed

  11   your holiday weekend.  You recall we are in the midst of the

  12   reading of the grand jury questioning of the defendant El

  13   Hage, and we will resume.

  19   Q.  You know that made trade more difficult from the Sudan to

  20   countries in Europe and North America, is that right?

  21   A.  Correct.

  23   A.  Correct.

  24   Q.  So it was important for the companies to try to do what

  25   they can to export products that they produced into Europe and


 
                                                                904

  19   Czechoslovakia and trucks were purchased in Russia, is that

  20   right?

  21   A.  Correct.

  22   Q.  One of the reasons that they were purchased in the eastern

  23   European countries was that it was much cheaper to purchase

  24   items in the eastern European countries than they would be in

  25   the western European countries or in the United States, is


 
                                                                905

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   that correct?

   2   A.  Yes, cheaper, and they give them more time for paying.

   3   Q.  So for the business enterprises involved in the Bin Laden

   4   companies, there was a lot of travel not only to western

   5   Europe but to eastern Europe and other countries where items

   6   could be purchased cheaper.

   7   A.  Correct.

  13   or even to the Far East was somewhat difficult for you because

  14   you had a Sudanese passport, is that correct?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  People who had either European, western European passports

  17   or American passports were table able to travel much easier,

  18   is that correct?

  21   that right?

  22   A.  Yes.

  24   passports, is that correct?

  11   Sudanese?

  12   A.  No, I think it's much less.

  13   Q.  And there are a lot of things that aren't produced in

  14   Sudan if you want to run a business that you have to purchase

  15   outside of the Sudan, is that right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  So either you or Abu Rida or other people -- withdrawn.

  18   Abu Rida had an American passport, didn't he?

  19   A.  I hear that, yes.

  20   Q.  Do you know who Abu Khadija is?

  22   Q.  People like him would travel to eastern Europe and western

  23   Europe to try to get the best things that were needed that had

  24   to be imported into the Sudan, is that right?

  25   A.  Right.


 
                                                                907

   7   withdrawn.

   8            Taba was a company that sold things inside of the

   9   Sudan, is that right?

  10   A.  Yes, the local stuff.

  11   Q.  And for it to make money, you would have to get it at a

  12   lower price and then sell it at a higher price, is that right?

  13   A.  Correct.

  14   Q.  And then, since the Sudan is a very poor country, you have

  15   to make sure you get a real low price for these items because

  16   otherwise you will not be able to sell them in Sudan, is that

  17   right?

  18   A.  Correct.

  19   Q.  So part of the travel of these people who had either

  20   European or American passports was to see if they could do

  21   trading, buying something in another country that is less

  22   expensive and selling it in the Sudan at a relatively cheap

  23   price to make a profit, is that right?

  24   A.  Correct.

  25   Q.  There came a time that you left working as an assistant


 
                                                                908

   8   Q.  When do you think that you went to work for Abu Rida as

   9   his assistant?

  10   started doing a lot of traveling instead of Abu Rida, is that

  11   right?

  15   Abu Rida was doing before.

  16   A.  Correct.

  17   Q.  And you were working mostly for Abu Rida at that time.  If

   7   all this information?

  11   party, the particular opposition party that brought you to

  12   Saudi Arabia was going to try to take the reward for the

  13   Saudis and keep it for themselves and you not get anything;

  14   isn't that right?

  17   the Saudis that you earned, isn't that right?

  20   your demands you finally go as a last resort to the Americans,

  21   is that right?

  22   A.  No, when I come back from Saudi Arabia, they say wait in

  23   Azmarai two weeks or three weeks, but I decide after three

  24   days if I go to Americans maybe it's better, because Saudis

  25   they want me to work outside, they want me to go to Pakistan,


 
                                                                923

  10   the Saudis?

  11   A.  I don't trust the plan, not personally.

  12   Q.  Didn't you say flat out to the Americans, I do not trust

  13   the Saudis?

  14   A.  What I mean, the plan, not the people.

  15   Q.  So you did tell the Americans that you did not trust the

  16   Saudis but you are explaining now that that didn't mean I did

  17   not trust the Saudis, I didn't trust their plan.  Is that what

  18   you say?

  19   A.  There is millions of people.  That not means I don't trust

   1   A.  OK.

   2            THE COURT:  Understand, the question isn't what it

  10   my to hide.  We work in the business, we work in security, we

  17   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, do you think that the fight against the

  18   Russian communists by the Afghan mujahideen and the other

  19   Muslim volunteers was a good thing?

  20   A.  I don't believe that.  If he would tell me Farouk Mosque

  21   about what's going on there, and that's why I go.

  22   Q.  So when you went over.

  23   A.  When you go somewhere, you need somebody to tell you about

  24   that.

  25   Q.  So when you went to the -- so when you were raising money

  15   that's a good idea.

  16   Q.  Did you think it was a good thing?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  About all the people trying to force the Russian

  19   communists out of Afghanistan?

  20   A.  Yes, that's right.

  21   Q.  Did you support them?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  You supported them by working and getting money, is that

  24   right?

  25   A.  Yes.


 
                                                                940

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  And you knew that Muslims from around the world were going

   2   to Afghanistan to actually help fight or help relief work in

   3   Afghanistan?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  Now, before you were asked to go, did you have any

   6   thoughts about that might be a good thing for you to do?

   7   A.  Well, when I hear the first one they tell me about the

   8   fatwa I say, well, that's a good idea, because Bin Laden Abdul

   9   Azzam, they make lecture in jihad magazine, and we read the

  10   magazine in Brooklyn, and we see, well, this is fatwa.

  11   Q.  So you were following what was going on in Afghanistan at

  12   the mosque, at the Afghani Center or was that --

  13   A.  Farouk Mosque.

  14   Q.  Mektab?

  15   A.  Yes, Farouk Mosque is --

  16   Q.  Al kafar ring a bell?

  17   A.  Mosque Al kafar.

  18   Q.  And you're reading the jihad magazine?

  19   A.  Yes.  Mustafa Shalabi every magazine he give it to us and

  20   we read it.

  21   Q.  You knew that the Afghanis themselves were seeking help

  22   from Muslims to fight the Russians to throw them out of their

  23   country, right?

  24   A.  Correct, yes.

  25   Q.  The Afghanis invited, they wanted people to come and help


 
                                                                941

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   them, right?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And you read about what Bin Laden was doing, right?

   4   A.  Bin Laden and Azzam.

   5   Q.  And what Mr. Azzam was doing, right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  You thought that it would be a good thing for you as a

   8   person reestablishing your Muslim identity to go and help the

   9   Afghanis, is that right?

  10   A.  Yes, they say you have to.

  11   Q.  Well, did you take the request to go to Afghanistan as an

  12   order?

  13   A.  Yes, because fatwa Islam mean like you have to, better

  14   than do business or support your wife or kids, that I call it

  15   for the fatwa.

  16   Q.  Fatwa means that you have to think about what people say

  17   to see if you believe it's correct?

  18   A.  No, fatwa is different.  Fatwa means when the people tell

  19   you the jihad in Afghanistan fardh al khafiya means you have

  20   to go by yourself to leave everything and go.

  21   Q.  Isn't that the very big difference between Sunni and the

  22   Shia?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Right.  In the Shiites if the leader, if the imam, the

  25   leader, says something is true you follow it, right?


 
                                                                942

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   A.  Yes.

   2   Q.  But in the Sunni there is no leader like that, right?

   3   A.  Because we don't have.

   4   Q.  Right.  You have scholars who give their argument to you

   5   why this is correct?

   6   A.  Correct.

   7   Q.  Is that right?

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And what a fatwa is simply is if it's a proper fatwa is

  10   issued by a scholar who says, this is what you should be done

  11   and because of the reasons?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And they explain it in order to convince each individual

  14   Muslim of, that they're correct in doing this fatwa?

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  In fact, all through the Muslim Sunni world it's different

  17   scholars say different things, right?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And it's your responsibility, your ultimate responsibility

  20   as a good Muslim to make that determination on your own that

  21   this is a proper fatwa?

  22   A.  No, no.  Because if you think about the religion by itself

  23   is not right, because the scholar he bring the fatwa from the

  24   Holy Koran from what prophet Mohammed say from what the

  25   scholar in history say, so when he tell you about the fatwa


 
                                                                943

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   not about what he think about the Holy Koran.

   2   Q.  But aren't there times when there are different fatwas

   3   that are issued that are complete opposite things, right?

   4   A.  Yeah, but that time --

   5   Q.  Mr.

   6   A.  The scholar --

   7            THE COURT:  The question is, right?  Now he's

   8   answering your question.

   9   Q.  Now --

  10            THE COURT:  He's answers.

  11            MR. SCHMIDT:  He's going beyond, your Honor.

  12            THE COURT:  Mr. Reporter, read the question.

  13            (Record read)

  14   A.  At that time the most of the scholars in Arab countries

  15   and even the United States they say jihad in Afghanistan, and

  16   that means you have fardh al khafiya, but you can't even think

  17   about because you have to do just like prayer.

  18   Q.  A good example.  In Afghanistan all of the scholars agreed

  19   that it was an obligation of good Muslims around the world to

  20   help their Afghani brothers throw out the Russians, right?

  21   A.  It's not so you have to.  That's --

  22   Q.  Your obligation to help them throw out the Russians?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Because the Afghanis requested help, it was a enemy that

  25   was anti-Muslim that invaded their own country, so everybody


 
                                                                944

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   agreed, right?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Now, there are times when they don't always agree, these

   4   scholars, right?

   5   A.  Well, all the scholars they agree because it's in the

   6   paper.

   7   Q.  Now, let's use the interpreter.

   8            (Through the interpreter).  There are times when

   9   these scholars don't always agree about things other than

  10   Afghanistan, isn't that correct?

  11            THE INTERPRETER:  That means all the scholars agree

  12   and there are times --

  13   Q.  A good example of when scholars do not agree was about the

  14   American presence in Saudi Arabia, isn't that right?

  15   A.  I don't understand.

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Would you please translate that.

  17            (Through the interpreter)

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And when the scholars do not agree it's the individual

  20   Muslim who has the religious obligation to think and make

  21   their own decision as to what they believe is proper, isn't

  22   that correct?

  23   A.  No, is not correct.

  24   Q.  Are you saying that if someone issues, if some supposed

  25   scholar issues a fatwa that you personally believe is against


 
                                                                945

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Islam that --

   2   A.  Because --

   3   Q.  -- should still follow it?

   4   A.  If the fatwa about something like jihad is different than

   5   fatwa about prayer, because is all scholar they make same

   6   fatwa for jihad we follow them, but if some scholar they say

   7   is not jihad, some scholars they say is jihad, we leave it.

   8   I'm not going to follow this or this until they came together

   9   and this is example for fardh al khafiya you all came together

  10   they agreed, but now a lot of groups in Arab countries they

  11   say when jihad in that country some scholars they say no, so

  12   the people they say no, we don't do jihad.

  13   Q.  And a good Muslim then would say, I'm not going to follow?

  14   A.  Until the scholars come together.

  15   Q.  Now, let's go back to where it started.  You left your

  16   wife and you went to Afghanistan, is that right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  Now, the government said to you on direct examination,

  19   asked you in Islam are you allowed more than one wife?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  You said yes?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  Did you explain that to the government when you were

  24   talking with them years ago about how you are allowed to have

  25   more than one wife in Islam?


 
                                                                946

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   A.  I don't remember the conversation exactly, but Islam is

   2   you have more than one four wives that's allowed to go.

   3   Q.  And the government accepted the fact that it was perfectly

   4   permissible in Islam for you to have more than one wife,

   5   right?

   6   A.  In Islam, yes, if you have --

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.

   8   A.  If you have more than one wife okay.

   9            THE COURT:  Objection is sustained.  The question and

  10   answer stricken.  You want to pursue it, ask another question.

  11   Q.  Did any representative of the government say to you at any

  12   time that, no, what you did was wrong about marrying the

  13   American woman?

  14   A.  I really don't remember.

  15            THE COURT:  Wrong about marrying the American woman?

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Right.

  17   A.  I don't remember.

  18   Q.  You don't remember them saying anything like that?

  19   A.  It could be, but I didn't remember now.  If I remember I

  20   say, you know, I'm glad to tell you.

  21   Q.  You were married already in the Sudan before you came to

  22   the United States, is that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Now, in fact, it's not simply, it's not permissible simply

  25   to get up and marry a second or a third or fourth wife just


 
                                                                947

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   because you decide, isn't that correct?

   2   A.  Because in Islam, yes, if you marry one or more than one,

   3   that's okay.

   4   Q.  Isn't -- doesn't Islam require that you obtain the

   5   permission of your first wife to marry a second wife?

   6   A.  If you tell her, that's great, if you don't tell her.

   7   Q.  Isn't it required in Islam that before you take a second

   8   wife that you obtain the permission of the first wife?

   9   A.  Some scholar they say you have to.  Some scholars they say

  10   no.  If you married then after that you tell her, that's also

  11   okay.

  12   Q.  And how many years do you have to tell your second wife

  13   that, your first wife that you've taken a second wife?

  14   A.  Well, the worst thing if you tell her right away is good

  15   for you and her.

  16   Q.  This is one of the things where scholars disagree and you

  17   decided to follow the scholars that say you can go to another

  18   country and marry a woman and not tell anybody?

  19   A.  No, not because I follow other scholar but I make mistake

  20   like everybody you know, I didn't tell my wife, the first

  21   wife.

  22   Q.  Well, isn't it a fact that another one of the rules about

  23   taking more than one wife is not to cause any distress to the

  24   first wife, the main wife, the first wife, isn't that true?

  25   A.  Well, look, I love her so much I say the first one, but


 
                                                                948


                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   when I come here I feel like if I marry it's better for me.

   2   Q.  In other words, when you want to do something that you

   3   want to do, you don't care what Islam says, isn't that right?

   4   A.  I didn't say I don't care, but I say I make mistake I

   5   should tell my first wife I'm in United States, I want to

   6   protect myself to marry the woman, I should tell her that, but

   7   I make mistake and I didn't tell her.

   8   Q.  How did you treat your second wife?

   9   A.  Very good.

  10   Q.  Very good?  And was it very good when you said, bye honey,

  11   I'm going to Afghanistan?

  12   A.  No.  No, I didn't told her, bye, honey.  I tell her I want

  13   to go to Afghanistan.  I don't know if I go to die over there

  14   because the Afghan, but I didn't her like I go to grocery

  15   store, I go to --

  16   Q.  Were you sending money back to your first wife when you

  17   were in the United States?

  18   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  19   Q.  Were you sending money back to your first wife when you

  20   were in the United States?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  Without your second wife knowing about it?

  23   A.  The first, the wife here?

  24   Q.  The first wife is in the Sudan, right?

  25   A.  Yes, the first wife in Sudan.


 
                                                                949

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  Then you came to the United States, right?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  You started working, you got married, you're a lonely man

   4   in the United States, you got married, right, and intimate

   5   marital relations with her.  Did you send money to support

   6   your first wife in the Sudan?

   7   A.  Yes, yes.

   8   Q.  And your second wife didn't know about it.  You did it

   9   behind her back?

  10   A.  No, I didn't tell her.

  11   Q.  And how much money have you given your second wife since

  12   you come back to the United States?

  13   A.  The wife I live here in the United States?

  14   Q.  Yes?

  15   A.  I pay for the rents every week $50.

  16   Q.  To which wife?

  17   A.  The wife here.

  18   Q.  Do you have a child with her?

  19   A.  No.

  20   Q.  So you've been since you're back in the United States

  21   you're giving your first wife $50?

  22   A.  No, no, no, I talk about the wife here in the United

  23   States, we share the apartment, and I pay the rent every week,

  24   $50.  I buy some food and other stuff.

  25            THE COURT:  What time interval are we talking about?


 
                                                                950

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  That's when you were in the United States living with her?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  Now, you told the Americans the first day that you started

   4   talking to them that you were forced by your superiors to

   5   divorce your American wife?

   6   A.  I not understand what you said.

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  Can you translate, please.

   8            (Through the interpreter)

   9   A.  The people I work with in Brooklyn they tell me you have

  10   to go to Afghanistan and you have fatwa.

  11   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, did you tell the Americans that you were

  12   forced by your superiors to divorce your first wife after one

  13   year?

  14   A.  When I talk about the fatwa.

  15   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl --

  16            Can we have the question translated please?

  17            I'll rephrase the question.

  18            Mr. Al Fadl, did you tell the Americans that you were

  19   forced by your superiors to divorce your American wife after

  20   one year?

  21   A.  Yes.  But I talk about the fatwa, 'cause I have to go to

  22   Afghanistan.

  23   Q.  Did you tell the Americans that you traveled to the United

  24   States in 1985 or 1986 for Islamic military training on the

  25   second interview with the Americans?


 
                                                                951

  13   A.  No, I never remember, I never tell them that.

  14   Q.  Thank you.

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, this may be a good point to

   4   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, how much was it for an application to the

   5   University of Georgia?

   6   A.  I don't remember.

   7   Q.  How many pages was the application that you had to fill

   8   out to go to the University of Georgia?

   9   A.  I remember my brother Ibrahim he bring the application for

  10   me.  I don't remember it's two or three weeks.

  11   Q.  Did you have to provide any other information to the

  12   University of Georgia to get admitted to the University of

  13   Georgia?

  14   A.  I remember at that time my brother Ibrahim and my cousin

  15   they tried to help me, but they said they need the high school

  16   for Sudan and other stuff.

  17   Q.  How much did you pay for the first semester for the

  18   school?

  19   A.  We got the first semester, I don't know it's six hundred

  20   for just English for two months.

  21   Q.  At that time in 1986 your English wasn't as good as it is

  22   now, is that right?

  23   A.  No.

  21   United States that the government asked you about Wadih El

  22   Hage, isn't that correct, Mr. Al Fadl?

  23   A.  I don't remember.

  24   Q.  When was the first time that Mr. El Hage's name Abu

  25   Abdallah came up?


 
                                                                960

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  16            THE COURT:  Are you defining office now as a place

  17   where he had a desk?

  11   Q.  Remember testifying that you went to an office to get the

  12   documents.  You remember that?

  13   A.  But that's in Afghanistan, not in the Sudan.

  14   Q.  In the Sudan?

  15   A.  No.  What I remember I tell them I went that I can

  16   Pakistan, because I went to Egypt from Pakistan.

  17   Q.  What year was that?

  18   A.  I really don't remember.

  19   Q.  It's 1991 or 1992?

  20   A.  No, before '92.

  21   Q.  1991?

  22   A.  I really not sure, if '90 or '91.

  23   Q.  You said that you saw Tamsa Al Nibi?

  24   A.  Hamdala.

  25   Q.  Excuse me?


 
                                                                967

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   A.  Hamdala Al Nibi.

   2   Q.  Where were they?

   3   A.  In the shower, and before I had a bath in the shower we

   4   had office over there.

   5   Q.  Now, you said there is a time you met somebody named Abu

   6   Abd al Sabbur?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  But you had no dealings with him there?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  Now, it's not your testimony that Abu al Sabbur is Mr. El

  11   Hage, is it?

  12   A.  No, what I tell them I'm not sure if Wadih El Hage or

  13   somebody different.

  14   Q.  So it's your testimony now that you might have seen Mr. El

  15   Hage back in Afghanistan when you were -- Pakistan -- when you

  16   were picking up your documents to travel?

  17   A.  No.  I tell them the guy he have the documents in that

  18   office, I'm not sure if it is Wadih El Hage or somebody else

  19   but I didn't tell them I never see them, I see him in the

  20   guest house in a different time.

  21   Q.  But you said that the person that you saw, but didn't deal

  22   with, was a person named Abdel al Sabbur, right, that's the

  23   words you used?

  24   A.  That's what people called him.  His nickname is Al Sabbur.

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.


 
                                                                968

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  You know him, Mr. El Hage, you know his name, he's sitting

   2   right over there, is that correct?

   3   A.  Yes, I know his name is Wadi El Hage.

   4   Q.  So if it was Mr. El Hage sitting there, you would have

   5   said it was Mr. Wadih El Hage, is that right?

   6   A.  No, because Abdullah and they help me with that trip so I

   7   didn't deal with him, and sometime you go inside the office

   8   then you see people sitting, but after a few months you don't

   9   remember, you know, who is exactly.  That's why I tell them

  10   I'm not sure is Wadih or somebody else.

  11   Q.  Mr. El Hage obviously did not leave an impression on you

  12   very much when it took you over a year to even talk with him

  13   about the government, is that correct?

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.

  15            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  16   Q.  Are you known also as Abu Ubaidah?

  17   A.  Know what?

  18   Q.  Are you known also as Abu Ubaidah?

  19   A.  I don't remember, because the people switch the nicknames.

  20   Could be one person he got five nicknames.

  21            THE COURT:  The question is whether the witness was

  22   known by that name?

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, that's my question.

  24   A.  I don't remember.

  25   Q.  Let me make sure that we have no misunderstanding.

  12   A.  No, he's Sudian.

  13   Q.  I'm asking you do you know any other Sudanese who stole

  14   money from Mr. Bin Laden?

  16   Q.  You don't know or you don't remember?

  17   A.  I know, but I don't remember now.

  18   Q.  Now, Mr. Al Fadl, you told us a little bit of a speech I

  19   think that you said Abu Hajer --

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  Withdrawn.

  21   Q.  -- gave concerning the declarations of Mohammed Ibn

  22   Tamiyeh.  Do you remember that?

  23   A.  Yes, I remember the speech.

  24   Q.  And it involved the war with the Tartars, the Tartars?

  25   A.  Tarta, yes.


 
                                                                970

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  And you said that in that speech that Mohammed Ibn

   2   Tamiyeh?

   3   A.  Ahmed.

   4   Q.  Ahmed?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Ibn Tamiyeh said that it was okay just to kill civilians

   7   in a war and if they're innocent they'll go to heaven, right?

   8   Isn't that what you said?

   9   A.  Yes, he talk about that time and he said the Tartar is the

  10   Muslim people hit the Tartar or around the Tartar, under the

  11   war you can if you kill them, you not wrong.

  12   Q.  Now, isn't it a fact that what Mr. Ibn Tamiyeh said that

  13   under certain extreme circumstances that innocent women,

  14   children, or older people may be killed in a war, is that

  15   right?

  16   A.  Yes, because he say --

  17   Q.  Just yes, is the answer?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  And isn't the circumstances that he said that it's okay

  20   was when the Tartars were using innocent Muslim women,

  21   children and older people as shields as they attacked Muslim

  22   villages, and that the Muslims could not defend themselves

  23   because they were not allowed to shoot at the innocent women,

  24   children, and older people who were being used as shields,

  25   isn't that how the story goes?


 
                                                                971

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   2   A.  No, not exactly what you say.

   3   Q.  Isn't it a fact that he said that Muslims can protect

   4   their homes, their lands and their family and they can shoot

   5   at the attacking Tartars trying to avoid killing the innocent

   6   but if they don't and the innocents die then it is not a sin,

   7   it is permissible?  Isn't that what he said --

   8   A.  No, what I remember, if you don't mind I tell you what I

   9   remember, what he say.

  10   Q.  Sure, go right ahead, Mr. Al Fadl, tell us what you

  11   remember now what he said.

  12   A.  What I remember he say when is the Muslim people go to the

  13   Tartar, when the Tartar come to the Muslim land, the Muslim

  14   they should leave the area to go help the other Muslim against

  15   Tartar, but if the Muslim around them are the fighting Muslim

  16   they came and they kill the innocent this is their problem why

  17   they came around the Tartar.

  18   Q.  Now, also you said that you could kill any Muslim who was

  19   doing business with the Tartars?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  Isn't it a fact what Abu Hajer told you about what Tamiyeh

  22   said was that the Tartars were at war with the Muslims?

  23            Can you translate, please?

  24            (Through the interpreter)

  25   A.  Yes.


 
                                                                972

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  That anyone doing business with the Tartars was helping

   2   the Tartars conquer the Muslim lands and kill the Muslim

   3   people?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And that should you find anyone, any Muslim who is helping

   6   the Tartars kill and attack Muslims, that you are to bring

   7   them to the court at that time and if they are found guilty

   8   they are to be executed?

   9            Isn't that what he explained?

  10   A.  He talk during war like the people fight and the Muslim

  11   against the Tartar and you kill him because his problem why he

  12   help the Tartar and why he around the Tartar.

  13   Q.  Because he was helping the enemy?

  14   A.  Yes.  Help them, and with them.

  15   Q.  That's just like nowadays like what would be treason,

  16   isn't that right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And in many countries treason is punishable now by death,

  19   isn't that right?

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.  401.

  21            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  22   A.  Yes.

  23            THE COURT:  No.  It's stricken.

  24   Q.  Now, weren't there political discussions -- withdrawn.

  25            Weren't there discussions among al Qaeda members


 
                                                                973

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   about American troops fighting the Iraqis in Saudi Arabia?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  And isn't it, wasn't the discussion about the bad things

   4   that Saddam Hussain was doing to good Muslims in the Arabian

   5   peninsula?

   6            (Witness consults with interpreter)

   7   A.  I really don't remember.

   8   Q.  Wasn't there people who said it wasn't a bad thing for the

   9   Americans to help defeat Saddam Hussein in Kuwait?

  10            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  11   A.  In our group is your question?

  12   Q.  Wasn't there a number of people in the discussions that

  13   you had amongst al Qaeda members that believed it was not a

  14   bad thing for the Americans to fight the Iraqis and get them

  15   out of Kuwait?

  16   A.  Well, at that time, yeah, different people got different

  17   things.

  18   Q.  And isn't it that there was a dispute among all Muslims,

  19   not just al Qaeda, but all Muslims about America's role in

  20   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait?  Isn't that right?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.  Time frame.

  22            THE COURT:  Yes, time and place.

  23   Q.  During the Gulf War.

  24            (Through the interpreter)

  25   A.  Yes.


 
                                                                974

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  And after the war was over isn't it the general Muslim

   2   belief that the Americans should leave Saudi, Arabia, the land

   3   of the holy places?

   4   A.  Yes.

   5   Q.  And the vast majority of Muslims believed it in 1991 and

   6   believe it today, isn't that right?

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  The only dispute is how, what to be done to force, to make

   9   the Americans leave the land of the holy places, isn't that

  10   right?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And you, as you sit here right now, you believe that the

  13   American troops should not be in Saudi Arabia, isn't that

  14   correct?

  15   A.  You ask me about the religion or political?

  16   Q.  I'm asking you as a Muslim person who is sitting in this

  17   courtroom, do you believe that the Americans should still be

  18   in the land of the holy places?

  19   A.  It's hard to say yes or no.

  20   Q.  Doesn't many or most Muslims think that Americans who are

  21   not Muslims should not be guarding the most sacred places in

  22   Islam, isn't that right?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.

  24            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  25   A.  If you let me --


 
                                                                975

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1            THE COURT:  Sustained.  When I sustain an objection

   2   it means you don't answer the question.

   3            THE WITNESS:  Okay.

   4   Q.  Now, there was mention on your direct examination of

   5   something about Saudi Arabia, you remember that?  Withdrawn.

   6            Do you remember being asked about an Egyptian,

   7   remember I think the Egyptian Islamic jihad raising the

   8   question that the American embassy in Saudi Arabia should be

   9   attacked?

  10   A.  Yeah.

  11   Q.  And you said that obviously wasn't done, right?

  12   A.  No.

  13   Q.  That's correct?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  But you weren't clear why.  Do you remember testifying to

  16   that?

  17   A.  I don't remember why he didn't do it.

  18   Q.  Isn't it a fact that the Saudis that were members of al

  19   Qaeda who were present at the time that it was mentioned said

  20   no, you don't do that against civilian targets?

  21   A.  I remember some people they say no, it's not good idea.

  22   Q.  They didn't just say, no, it's not a good idea.  They said

  23   that you do not go against civilian targets?

  24   A.  Yes.

  25   Q.  Isn't that correct?


 
                                                                976

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   A.  Correct.

   2   Q.  And it was dropped?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  Right?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, this would be a good time

   7   to break.

   8            THE COURT:  All right.  We will break for lunch and

   9   we'll resume at 2:15.

   1                         AFTERNOON SESSION

   2                             2:15 p.m.

   3            (Jury not present)

   4            THE COURT:  The juror whose mother passed away

   5   writes:  "I am sorry to announce the passing of my mother on

   6   Monday, February 19, at 12:35 p.m.  The arrangements have not

   7   been final yet.  Our family is to try to have a funeral on

   8   Friday, based on availability of chapel.  If not Friday, then

   9   based on availability.  I will inform the marshal."

  10            MR. COHN:  Is your Honor convinced that the juror can

  11   pay attention for the rest of the week?  It is distracting to

  12   have your mother pass away, and all I am asking is have you

  13   inquired as to whether or not --

  14            THE COURT:  I think his actions, the fact that he

  15   does this demonstrates a desire to continue on the jury.  Does

  16   anybody else think that I should ask him whether it is a

  17   problem?

  18            MR. COHN:  Your Honor, I am sure it demonstrates

  19   fidelity.  I am not sure it demonstrates reality once his

  20   mother has just passed.  All I am asking is that we ask if the

  21   afternoon is well passed or if the juror will be elsewhere

  22   because they are upset.

  23            THE COURT:  I will observe his demeanor carefully

  24   during the afternoon and see if there is a problem.

                                                                979

   3   cross-examination.

   4   CROSS-EXAMINATION continued

   5   BY MR. SCHMIDT:

   6   Q.  Mr. Al-Fadl, do you know what the word couple means?

   7   A.  Can you spell it.

   8   Q.  C-O-U-P-L-E.

   9   A.  No.

  10   Q.  Do you know that couple means two, pair?  Two?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12            THE COURT:  It doesn't mean two pair.  Couple means

  13   two.  Two pair are four.

  14            MR. SCHMIDT:  Thank you, your Honor.  I think I'm

  15   out.

  16            (Laughter)

  17   Q.  Mr. Al-Fadl, isn't it a fact that you told government

  18   agents that you were at the Damazine camp only on a couple of

  19   occasions?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And a couple means approximately two occasions.

  22   A.  Two or more.

  23   Q.  Does a couple mean two or more or a couple mean two?

  24            THE COURT:  The question isn't really what it means

  25   in Webster.  What did you understand it to mean?


 
                                                                980

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   A.  What I remember, I tell them I visit the Damazine camp

   2   different times.

   3   Q.  What you told them is that you visited the Damazine camp

   4   two times.

   5   A.  What I remember is more than two.

   6   Q.  Do you remember telling the government that it is two

  15   Laden personally?

  17   what else that means.

  15   Qaeda group only.

  16   Q.  Thank you.  You also were told and read that there was

  17   that you must keep your work and your missions confidential.

  18   (Interpreted)

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  You were told and you read that you were not to talk about

  21   your work for al Qaeda with anybody other than your immediate

  22   superior, isn't that right?

  23   A.  No, it is not like what you said.

  24   Q.  Weren't you told that if you needed to talk to anyone

  25   other than your immediate superior for the purpose of what you


 
                                                                994

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   were doing you needed to get the permission of your immediate

   2   superior?

   3   A.  If you want me explain I explain, because it is hard to

   4   say yes or no.

   5   Q.  Then please explain.

   6   A.  If we are 10 guys in a group, we went somewhere, we know

   7   what going on about, everybody know his rule and emir tell

   8   everybody what he has to do.  So when we went for prayer after

   9   prayer, with the same 10 guys, we talk about what going on.

  10   Q.  So if all 10 of you had the same mission, the same role,

  11   you were able to talk to them, right?

  12   A.  This is the for attack or mission, for military purpose.

  13   But if someone is going to be made fatwah or they want to send

  14   troops somewhere, one speaks for all of the members.

  15   Q.  That is when there is a discussion about general goals,

  16   right?

  17   A.  Yes, about who is going, who is not going.

  18   Q.  General goals there was a discussion.

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  Specific, there were no discussions other than the people

  21   on each particular mission, is that correct?

  22   A.  Not exactly what you say.

  23   Q.  Weren't you told that you were to keep your work

  24   confidential and not discuss it with people, not to talk about

  25   it, not to gossip about it?  Isn't that right?


<P>                                                               995

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   A.  When they say that, they talk about the people not in the

   2   group, not the member, the people in Qaeda member.

   3   Q.  Let's talk about some things that you did for al Qaeda.

   4   You delivered some documents in Egypt, is that correct?

   5   A.  Yes, from Pakistan.

   6   Q.  Were you told what was in the documents?

   7   A.  No.

   8   Q.  Were they sealed?

   9   A.  What means sealed?  (Interpreted)

  10            Yes.

  11   Q.  You were given documents, told to give them to a person,

  12   and that was it, right?

  13   A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  No one told you about what was in the documents, is that

  15   correct?

  16   A.  No.

  17   Q.  You didn't have a discussion with the people when you were

  18   in Egypt about what was in the documents, is that correct?

  19   A.  No.

  20   Q.  And when you came back you didn't discuss it with anybody,

  21   what was in the documents, is that correct?

  22   A.  Well, the people near me in Qaeda tell me I went to Egypt,

  23   I saw Abu Hafs el Masry and I saw Bakhri, and I traveled from

  24   Karachi to Egypt.  This what I know about my trip, I tell

  25   them.


 
                                                                996

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  But you didn't know what the purpose was other than an

   2   envelope, is that right?  You were not --

   3   A.  What I know?

   4   Q.  You were not told, is that correct?

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  You went to Hungary.

   7   A.  Yes.

   8   Q.  And you were told to meet a particular person, is that

   9   correct?

  10   A.  Yes, in Budapest.

  11   Q.  You weren't told why you were going there, were you?

  12   A.  They said he want to talk to you over there.

  13   Q.  You weren't told why you were going there before you left,

  14   is that correct?

  15   A.  Yes, because I don't have visa, they want to talk to me,

  16   they say maybe you have problem in airport.  Because each trip

  17   is different.  Some trips they tell you everything seems fine.

  18   But if some problems they think, they try don't to tell you,

  19   if you catch by police or anything, you don't have to say

  20   anything.

  21   Q.  They didn't tell you when you went to Hungary, is that

  22   correct?

  23   A.  Because I didn't have visa.

  24   Q.  Because you didn't have visa?

  25   A.  Yes.


 
                                                                997

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  Then you learned not being told anything in Hungary but

   2   being told to go to Zagreb.

   3   A.  Correct.

   4   Q.  And you weren't told when you were going to Zagreb why you

   5   were going to Zagreb, is that correct?

   6   A.  No, Bin Laden by himself, and I remember Abu Faqil el

   7   Makkee al Hajj, in the same office told me when you go to

   8   Zagreb after Budapest we need to study the business investment

   9   over there, because the Croatian government sell a lot of

  10   companies.

  11   Q.  So you knew the portion to go to Zagreb was to get

  12   business and commercial information.

  13   A.  And also to meet a person name Mohamed Sarudani, and he

  14   tell me what going on inside Bosnia.

  15   Q.  And that information, the commercial information from

  16   Croatia and information about what's going on in Bosnia was

  17   given to you and you brought it back.

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  You went to Nairobi in 1991, didn't you?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And not only did you go, you went with your wife, isn't

  22   that correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  You weren't told about why you were going, were you?

  25   A.  No.  What I remember what he told me, he told me this is


 
                                                                998

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   envelope, you going to meet, is Egyptian guy, I forget his

   2   name right now, he you meet him, give him the envelope, and we

   3   need you to work over there and take your wife with you.  When

   4   we went over there, the Egyptian guy he tell me no, we talk

   5   with Banshir about that, and you going to go to Pakistan.

   6   After that, we went to Pakistan.

   7   Q.  Never finding out what the purpose was of going to Kenya,

   8   is that correct?  It was kept confidential from you, isn't

   9   that right?

  10   A.  Sometimes they change their mind after they tell you go

  11   somewhere for working over there, and sometimes, because the

  12   envelope I have, the documents I give to the Egyptian guy.

  13   Q.  Were you ever told the reason that you were going to

  14   Kenya?

  15   A.  Not that time, but I remember year or something after, I

  16   know Banshiri, he tried to work in horn of Africa, in Djibouti

  17   and Kenya and Yemen and that region.

  18   Q.  Anything else?

  19   A.  No.

  20   Q.  In your bayat, you were also told to preserve the money of

  21   Al Qaeda, is that right?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  Part of that would be taking an oath not to steal from Al

  24   Qaeda.

  25   A.  Yes.


 
                                                                999

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  And you swore a bayat not to steal from Al Qaeda.

   2   A.  Correct.

   3   Q.  There is no dispute among scholars, Islamic scholars,

   4   about the wrongfulness of stealing for yourself when you are

   5   not starving, isn't that right?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  You also were told in your bayat that your superiors must

   8   follow Islamic law.

   9   A.  Correct.

  10   Q.  That unless they follow Islamic law you don't have to do

  11   what they ask, is that correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And you were told that you should obey your leaders as

  14   much as possible.

  15   A.  Yes.

  16   Q.  And that meant that if you believed that they were doing

  17   or saying or asking you to do something that was not

  18   Islamically correct, you did not have to obey them.  Isn't

  19   that right?

  20   A.  Could you repeat.

  21   Q.  That meant that if you believed your superior told you to

  22   do something that was not Islamically correct, you did not

  23   have to listen to him, isn't that right?

  24   A.  We talk about it.  If he tell me something is not right,

  25   we talk.  Like first time was --


 
                                                                1000

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  If one of your leaders told you to steal from an orphanage

   2   because they didn't like that orphanage, would you do it?

   3   A.  What mean orphanage?  (Interpreted)

   4            No, I don't believe.

   5   Q.  Because it would be unIslamic, wouldn't it?

   6   A.  Yes.

   7   Q.  If one of your leaders told you that, see that boy on the

   8   street?  I don't like him, he looks different, go and kill

   9   him.  Would you go and kill him?

  10   A.  No.

  11   Q.  Because it would be unIslamic, right?

  12   A.  No, but if he is in building with other military people it

  13   would make a difference.  But nobody tell you go and kill that

  14   baby, that never going to happen.  But if the baby inside

  15   building with military and other staff, that difference.

  16   Q.  Thank you, Mr. Al-Fadl.  Am I correct that if you are told

  17   that you should do something that you personally did not

  18   believe was Islamic, that you had not only the right but the

  19   responsibility not to participate?  Isn't that correct?

  20   A.  Well, in a group we have something fatwah.  There is no

  21   one tell you go and do that.  They make fatwah, they make it

  22   clear, they tell you what the purpose of fatwah, what the

  23   benefit for what we doing.  Everything they explain everything

  24   for you, why they make fatwah, what's the benefit from that

  25   attack or why they doing that.  There is no one come and tell


 
                                                                1001

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   you just go do that.  So everything is fatwah, with shura

   2   council and meeting and lecture.

   3   Q.  The purpose of these meetings and lectures were to

   4   convince you that whatever the order was was Islamically

   5   correct, isn't that right?

   6   A.  It is not only Islamic, because they follow specific

   7   scholar.  Some scholars, they don't believe what we doing.  So

   8   when you say Islamic scholars, that mean all the scholars

   9   agree.  Some scholars don't agree what we doing.

  10   Q.  If the scholars did not agree and you were not convinced

  11   that it was Islamically correct, you would not do it, is that

  12   correct?

  13   A.  If they say fatwah, yes, I do it.

  14   Q.  Even if the Islamic scholars disagreed?

  15   A.  We talk about the scholars in a group.

  16            THE COURT:  If the scholars in al Qaeda agree, then

  17   what happens?

  18            THE WITNESS:  That mean it's fatwah.  If they ask me

  19   to do it, yes.

  20   Q.  Aren't there other scholars that the people in al Qaeda

  21   always discussed?

  22   A.  Yes.

  23   Q.  When you say scholars, in al Qaeda you had, I guess you

  24   called Abu Hajer, he was not even a member of al Qaeda, was

  25   he?


 
                                                                1002

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   A.  Could you repeat the question.

   2   Q.  Was one of the scholars you are talking about Abu Hajer?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  He was not even a member, to your knowledge, of al Qaeda,

   5   is that correct?

   6   A.  What I believe, he is one of our people in al Qaeda.

   7   Q.  Didn't you say that you did not know and other people said

   8   that he was not?

   9   A.  Yes.  I never see him --

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, your Honor.  May he

  11   finish the answer?

  12            THE COURT:  Yes.

  13   A.  I never see him make bayat.  He never tell me I am member

  14   of al Qaeda.  But the time between when we start al Qaeda

  15   until I left al Qaeda, he is arguing and talking about the

  16   stuff in guesthouse, talking about stuff near Bin Laden, and

  17   make fatwah and make a speech.  All that for me, if he is not

  18   al Qaeda member, he can't do that.

  19   Q.  Didn't Abu Rida tell you that he was not a member of al

  20   Qaeda?

  21   A.  Yes, some people say that.  Some people, they say he is

  22   not al Qaeda member, but he help al Qaeda agenda.

  23   Q.  Wasn't Mr. Bin Laden in contact with religious scholars in

  24   Saudi Arabia?

  25   A.  Yes, he got two scholars.


 
                                                                1003

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  Didn't he talk about the scholars who were imprisoned in

   2   Saudi Arabia?

   3   A.  Yes, Salman al Auda and Safar al Hawali.

   4            MR. SCHMIDT:  We will try to get the spelling later

   5   for you.

   6   Q.  Didn't he tell you about what their beliefs were?

   7   A.  Could you repeat the question.

   8   Q.  Didn't he tell you what their beliefs were?

   9   A.  Who is tell me?

  10   Q.  Mr. Bin Laden.  The scholars -- withdrawn.

  11            Weren't you aware of those scholars' belief that

  12   force should not be used in the land of the holy places?

  13   A.  Well, if you let me just answer.  Safar al Hawali, he

  14   wrote a book about what he know, and we have discussion.  He

  15   say war, yes, but innocent people is not right.  But make a

  16   war is yes.  And the book is named Kashfel Kuma.

  17   Q.  So innocent people were not to be harmed, isn't that

  18   right?

  19   A.  This what Safar al Hawali believe, yes.

  20   Q.  Just like the Saudis said back in 1993 when someone raised

  21   the idea of the Saudi embassy being bombed, they said no, no

  22   innocents.

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Isn't that the Saudi belief?

  25   A.  Not --


 
                                                                1004

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  Isn't that the Saudi belief, Mr. Al-Fadl?

   2   A.  Let me answer.  Some of our membership, they don't believe

   3   in trying to kill innocent, some of the members, and they left

   4   the group.  But the people that support the fatwah, they stay

   5   in group and that --

   6            THE COURT:  Let him finish.

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  I apologize.

   8   A.  And I remember that in '93.

   9   Q.  9 --

  10   A.  '93 or '94.

  11   Q.  So now you are telling us for the first time that the

  12   people who didn't believe in killing innocents all left in

  13   1993?

  14   A.  This is what I remember.

  15   Q.  Is that what you are telling us now?

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  17   A.  That what I remember.

  18   Q.  Remember now?

  19   A.  Yes.

  20   Q.  You never mentioned it to anybody before, did you?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection to form.

  22   A.  You ask me questions and sometimes question refresh my

  23   mind and I try to give you right answer.

  24   Q.  Isn't it a fact that the group that talked about the

  25   bombing of the Saudi embassy is the Islamic Jihad of Egypt?


 
                                                                1005

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Wasn't that right?

   2   A.  It's not only that.  My first answer, when the people talk

   3   about the attack inside Egypt, some people, they left the

   4   group, they say that's not good thing to do.

   5   Q.  Mr. Al-Fadl, you told us before that the person who raised

   6   the question of bombing an American Embassy in Saudi Arabia

   7   was an Egyptian jihad member?

   8   A.  Yes, Abu el Masry.

   9   Q.  When Sheikh Rahman was arrested in the United States -- do

  10   you remember that?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  The Egyptian jihad people wanted to do something in

  13   revenge, isn't that right?

  14   A.  Correct.

  15   Q.  And nothing was done, isn't that right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  No one would agree to kill innocents in response to that,

  18   isn't that correct, Mr. Al-Fadl?

  19   A.  Let me answer.

  20   Q.  I asked you a question.  If you can't answer it, don't

  21   answer it.

  22            THE COURT:  He asked you a question is that correct.

  23   Now you can respond to that request.

  24   A.  I remember some people, they left the group, they say we

  25   don't want to do things immediately, we don't like that, and


 
                                                                1006

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   Bin Laden say we do, but this is going to take time.

   2   Q.  You never said that to the government.  What you said to

   3   the government, isn't that correct, that nothing was done and

   4   the Egyptian jihad members left because of it; isn't that what

   5   you said?

   6   A.  No, not all of the jihad group.  What I tell them, some of

   7   people, but not all the group.

   8   Q.  Thirteen to 20 members who were in Sudan at that time

   9   left, is that right?

  10   A.  Could you repeat.

  11   Q.  Thirteen to 20 Egyptian Islamic jihad members left the

  12   Sudan at that time.

  13   A.  Yes, it could be that, yes.

  14   Q.  You were very much involved with the NIF when you came

  15   back to the Sudan, isn't that right?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  You worked for the NIF, didn't you?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  In fact, you were under orders from the NIF to deliver

  20   weapons to the NIF militia in its civil war in the south of

  21   Sudan, isn't that right?

  22   A.  At that time in southwest Sudan, yes.

  23   Q.  At that time, that was under the authority of the NIF, the

  24   government of Sudan.

  25   A.  Yes, under militia headquarters.


 
                                                                1007

                               al-Fadl - cross

  13   that you embezzled large sums of money from Bin Laden in 1994

  14   and used to buy for yourself many residential lots in

  15   Umduhrman and al Jerafees, and also used the money to build a

  19   Q.  I am going to show you what has been marked as 3501-45,

  25   A.  No, that's never happen.  I tell them I got the money and


 
                                                                1011

                               al-Fadl - cross

   1   I buy residential but not factory for my brother.

   2   Q.  So is it your testimony now that you never told an agent

   3   of the United States government that you used some of the

   4   money you stole to help your brother build that oil press

   5   factory?

   6   A.  No, I never say that.  Maybe they understand me wrong.

   7   Q.  Some of the ways that you stole this money was that you

   8   diverted commodities to friends of yours to sell, isn't that

   9   right?

  10   A.  Would she help me.  (Interpreted)

  11            Yes, I sell the stuff for them and they give me

  12   commission.

  13   Q.  You didn't sell the stuff for them, you diverted some of

  14   the oil that was coming in through Mr. Bin Laden's connections

  15   to a friend of yours who then sold it and split the profits

  16   with you, isn't that right?

  17   A.  What I remember, I sold the stuff for them and they give

  18   me commission.  They sell it and they give me the money back

  19   and I got the commission.

  20   Q.  You never collected money for Mr. Bin Laden of the

  21   commodities that you gave your friends, isn't that right?

  22   A.  I don't understand what you say.  (Interpreted)

  23            What we do, we sell the stuff, and when I sell the

  24   stuff to them they give me commission, and I bring the money

  25   back to the company, and I take the commission.


 
                                                                1012

   8   A.  Correct.

   9   Q.  He is one of the people that you diverted sugar to, he

  10   sold it and didn't pay all the money he owed Mr. Bin Laden,

  11   isn't that right?

  13   not from al Sadeek.

  14   Q.  You had another arrangement with --

  15   A.  With Faizel but not with Sadeek.

   2   money to Mr. Bin Laden, isn't that right?

   4   Q.  Did you sell the other properties?

   5   A.  No.

   6   Q.  Isn't it a fact that the American government is giving you

   7   money because you've given up your assets in the Sudan, you

   8   can't get your assets in the Sudan?

   9   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  15   A.  He knew I work for the office.

  16   Q.  The only reason that you told Al Tayyib that you did steal

  17   the money is that they already had the proof against you,

  18   right?

  19   A.  He asked me first time and I say no, I didn't take any

  20   money.

  21   Q.  Right.  They asked you again and you said no, I didn't

  22   take any money.  And then the third time they had the proof

  23   and you knew that you were in the corner and you said, oh, yes

  24   I did take it?

  25   A.  He asked me.


 
                                                                1016

  12   isn't that right?

  15   everything, but we need to know something about you, I told

  16   them I don't have anything yet and they say no --

  17   Q.  I apologize?

  18   A.  They say no, we know something about you.  We understand

  19   you did ask, but you have to tell this because we know it.

  20   And the second day I tell them, yes, I took money from Bin

  21   Laden.

  22   Q.  You started talking to the Americans on September 7, 1996,

  23   is that right?

  24   A.  I don't remember the date.

   3   time that you met with them, that you were a thief, right?

   5   Q.  Is that right?  You told them about seven weeks, six weeks

   6   later after seeing them about twenty-seven times that you were

   7   a thief, isn't that right?

   8   A.  Well, first time when I saw them we talk about the group,

   9   they never ask me about did I take money.  They ask me

  10   everything, but the last two days they start ask me, we know

  11   now everything about the group.  We want to know something

  12   about you, and you have to tell us that.  I say I don't have

  13   anything.  They say, no, we know something about you.  If you

  14   tell us, we going to trust you.  And the second day I tell

   3   BY MR. SCHMIDT:

   4   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, the only reason you told the Americans about

   5   being a thief that is because you thought they already knew

   6   about it, isn't that correct?

   7   A.  Yeah, they tell me that they say we know about that.

   8   Q.  And if they didn't say that, you would have never told

   9   them, isn't that right?

  10   A.  If they don't ask me, yeah.

  11   Q.  That's correct.

  12            Now, when did you start working at al Sadani?

  13   A.  Maybe in '94, year '94.

  14   Q.  Near the end of '94?

  15   A.  I didn't remember which month, but I think during '94.

  16   Q.  Now, you also got into financial trouble with al Sadani,

  17   didn't you?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  There was money missing from al Sadani, isn't that right?

  20   A.  When the money missing because we used the money to

  21   support some of the Islamic National Front, we spend the money

  22   for the people work, bring the militia, like that, and the

  23   government, the Islamic National Front issued a loan from the

  24   bank to support the money we spent.  Until 1995 you don't give

  25   me the money and that's why I stopped working them, and I went


 
                                                                1020

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Kalif Sadur.

   2   Q.  You think the NIF accused you of stealing money, isn't

   3   that right?

   4   A.  It's not like that, but because somebody tell them I give

   5   Egyptian guy he wrote a book against Tayyib and he tell them

   6   Ab Bakkar he did that, he give Abu Bakar had El Masry's money

   7   to wrote book against Tayyib.

   8   Q.  So then the NIF was angry at you, right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And they accused you of stealing money from al Sadani,

  11   they accused you?

  12   A.  Yes, they don't pay the money back and they don't give me

  13   the loan from Khartoum bank.

  14   Q.  And that's right, they said that you had the money you had

  15   to pay it back, right?

  16   A.  Yes, because the loan, is a reason in my name, my older

  17   brother name, so all the papers it's our name.  If any

  18   problem, we got the problem.

  19   Q.  And you said that no, it wasn't, we didn't take the money,

  20   these other two people from NIF took the money, right?

  21   A.  It's not like that, because they should, when I spend the

  22   money for the Islamic National Front benefit they should give

  23   me a loan from Khartoum bank, and every time I went to them I

  24   went Dr. Abaka Kabir, Dr. Muslak Sabir, and I told them we

  25   spent a lot of money and we don't have a lot of money and we


 
                                                                1021

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   have to bring that money back to the bank, but later on I hear

   2   somebody tell that office I here to make a tape, wrote book

   3   against Tayyib.

   4   Q.  They said you took the money and you said no, it was

   5   Dr. Abd al-Mun'Imalkhabir, and Mohammed Hashim Hasan, and

   6   Dr. Abdallah Mohammed Yusuf.  You said they took the money,

   7   not me, right?

   8   A.  No, they didn't take it for themselves.  Money spending

   9   for the Islamic National Front work.

  10   Q.  And you said that you forgot to get a receipt from them,

  11   that's why you couldn't show that they took the money?

  12   A.  It's clear you know we spend the money for the work and I

  13   went to Bashihar, he runs the group at that time and I went to

  14   Ahmed Muli Aman.  I tell them the money we spend it for the

  15   office.  I buy car for Abdel Munim Gabir for the war, we buy

  16   house furniture, and a lot of people try to bring the work for

  17   Musada Sinna group, from Narin group, from Muslim brother, so

  18   I tell them this money I spent it for the work.

  19   Q.  Well, then what about the three people, didn't they come

  20   and say, yes, he gave, we got the money, and it was for Sudan?

  21   A.  Well, every time I went over there.  He tell me, we going

  22   to give the loan from Khartoum bank and I got letter from

  23   Ahmed Alima, Dr. Isman the manager of Khartoum bank and in the

  24   letter he tell me, he do great job and if he give him a loan.

  25   That's great.


 
                                                                1022

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  So you did a great job but nobody believed you?

   2   A.  No, they believe me, but somebody tell them I give Abu al

   3   Masry money for the book against Tayyib.  And at that time he

   4   got his own group, is he got his own group it's fight between

   5   NIF by themselves.

   6   Q.  Now, besides this problem with the money from al Sadani

   7   there was also the loan money that you owed, isn't that right?

   8   A.  Yes.  That's why we want to cover that loan because the

   9   money for the NIF it's come from the bank.

  10   Q.  In other words, based on what you say everybody else has

  11   caused you problems that may put in jail for owing money to

  12   the bank, is that what you're saying?

  13   A.  Yeah, they believe I give Abu Kar El Masry, money because

  14   he make tape and they think or somebody I think tell them I

  15   give the money to Abu Kar.

  16   Q.  And so none of this was your fault.  It was everybody

  17   else's fault, right?

  18   A.  Anyway, you know that Islamic National Front is a lot of

  19   companies they owned by people, but they do the government

  20   job.  It's like umbrella companies, and is a reason that time

  21   is the same, we, myself I own the company, but I run for

  22   Islamic National Front business.

  23   Q.  Now, who, which companies were being audited to determine

  24   how much you took out, was that the Bin Laden companies or is

  25   that the NIF companies?


 
                                                                1023

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   A.  Could you repeat your question?

   2   Q.  Which companies were being audited to determine how much

   3   you stole?  Was that the Bin Laden companies or the NIF

   4   companies?

   5   A.  No, we talk now about NIF company.

   6   Q.  They had accountants audit your books, right?

   7   A.  I don't understand what you say.

   8   Q.  They had accountants examine your records from the

   9   company, didn't they?

  10            (Witness consults interpreter)

  11   A.  For Sarine, Sarine company?

  12   Q.  Yes.

  13   A.  No, I run the business, I manage at that time for Sarine.

  15   Q.  Which are the companies that audited the books were

  16   examined?  Was that the Bin Laden companies?

  17   A.  I don't understand what you say.

  18            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  19   A.  I don't know what you mean.  We have a lot of companies in

  20   Bin Laden.

  21   Q.  Somebody sent a representative from the lawyer's office to

  22   examine the records to determine whether you stole money from

  23   the companies?

  24   A.  I think you talk about $110,000.

  25   Q.  So they had, so Bin Laden sent his attorney's office to


 
                                                                1024

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   audit the books at Laden International, is that right?

   2   A.  I don't remember that what I know Faraki asked me the same

   3   time and he say somebody come and tell him you stole the money

   4   and I tell him, yes, I got commission.

   5   Q.  Didn't they audit the books at the company that you were

   6   working for on two separate occasions?

   7   A.  I don't remember any lawyer or any attorney talk to me

   8   about that.

   9   Q.  Didn't you tell the government on October 21, 1996 that

  10   the legal office headed by Hasim abu Baka Al Jali did an

  11   investigation jointly by Bin Laden and the NIF and they

  12   concluded that you stole money?

  13   A.  What I remember Ajani he asked me about because one of the

  14   companies he bought Sudan the salt farm he want me to bring

  15   the license, because it's my name.

  16   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, I'm asking you what you said to the

  17   government back in 1996.  Didn't you tell them that there was

  18   a joint audit of the books of the company that you ran in

  19   1995?

  20   A.  I don't remember that.

  21   Q.  Did you tell them that after that --

  22   A.  I don't remember.

  23   Q.  -- there was a further audit for a month long?

  24   A.  I don't remember, but what I remember when Ajani he talk

  25   to me.


 
                                                                1025

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  You don't remember, Mr. Al Fadl --

   2            THE COURT:  Let him finish.

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  I thought he was finished, Judge.

   4   A.  What I remember Ajani talk to me about the salt farm in

   5   Sudan, it's under my name and he ask we need to switch the

   6   name to other person.

   7   Q.  Well, we'll do it this way.  I'm going to show you and ask

   8   then the interpreter to translate the area that I boxed on

   9   350145, 41, 47.

  10            May I approach the witness, your Honor?

  11            THE COURT:  Yes.

  12            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  13            (Pause)

  14   A.  What was the question?  Repeat the question.  This is the

  15   same I tell you, I know Mahif is one of our group sit down

  16   with me and they say the houses, the farm and we want to

  17   switch it to somebody else that in your name.

  18   Q.  That isn't the question, Mr. Al Fadl.  There were two

  19   separate long audits of the businesses that you were running,

  20   isn't that correct?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22   Q.  And both of those audits resulted in the determination

  23   that you were a thief, isn't that correct?

  24   A.  Yes, I remember in '95 they sat down with me and they tell

  25   me, he tell me we have proved you stole money and we need all


 
                                                                1026

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   the property under your name to switch it to somebody else,

   2   and we need that money back, and I remember that in '95.

   3   Q.  And the only reason that you finally admitted to Mr. Bin

   4   Laden and Mr. Al Tayyib was because two times they had audits

   5   and it was absolutely certain you couldn't deny it any more,

   6   you were caught, wasn't that correct?

   7   A.  Yes, he tell me somebody tell us you took commission from

   8   the sugar and oil.

   9   Q.  And that was the last time when you had this

  10   conversation -- withdrawn.

  11            The last time that you actually saw Mr. Bin Laden was

  12   in the summer of 1995, isn't that right?

  13   A.  I don't remember the month but in '95.

  14   Q.  It was the summertime of 1995?

  15   A.  I really don't remember but I remember in '95.

  16   Q.  Well, let's see if I can find where you told the

  17   government -- didn't you tell the government back in 1996 that

  18   the last time that you saw Mr. Bin Laden was the summer of

  19   1995?

  20   A.  I remember in '95 but I really don't remember the month or

  21   I remember if I say summer or winter.

  22   Q.  Well, the winter meaning in January or February?

  23   A.  No, the summer in Sudan between March until September and

  24   the winter start from November until January.  We have long

  25   summer in Sudan, six months.


 
                                                                1027

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  So what is your best guess as to when you saw him last,

   2   what month?

   3   A.  Probably between May and September or May and October.

   4   Q.  And you didn't leave until February of '95, is that

   5   correct?

   6   A.  Yes, correct.

   7   Q.  You were still going about your business having financial

   8   problems with al Sadani, isn't that right?

   9   A.  Yes.

  10   Q.  And it wasn't until February that you left?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  And the reason that you left was because you were afraid

  13   of the NIF?

  14   A.  And Bin Laden, also.

  15   Q.  You hadn't seen Bin Laden for months?

  16   A.  But I see the people groups, the membership.

  17   Q.  But nobody bothered you, the NIF was your concern, wasn't

  18   it?

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, --

  20   A.  Try my best to be back to the group and I remember I think

  21   it was Bin Laden talk to him and he say we want to know why

  22   you do that.  We not care about money, but we care about you

  23   the first one that join the group.

  24   Q.  When was that?

  25   A.  I really don't remember the month.


 
                                                                1028

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   Q.  Was that after the summer of 1995?

   2   A.  I don't remember really, but I remember that the last

   3   conversation between me and him and I went back to Mahib and I

   4   went back to Abu Rida al Suni and they tell me the best thing

   5   for you if you bring all the money.

   6   Q.  I'm going to show you what's marked 3501-45, page 2.  I

   7   ask you to read the area that has been circled.

   8            May I approach, your Honor?

  10   interpreter)

  11            (Pause)

  12   Q.  Does that refresh your recollection as to the last time --

  13   withdrawn.  Does that refresh your recollection?

  14   A.  Yes, summer '95.

  15   Q.  Last time that you saw Mr. Bin Laden was the summer of

  16   1995?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And the time that you left Sudan was in February of 1996,

  19   right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  Now, you came to the United States and you didn't follow

  22   the visa to go to school, did you?

  23   A.  Could you repeat the question?

  24   Q.  You went to the United States under false pretenses,

  25   didn't you?


 
                                                                1029

                               Al Fadl - cross

   2   Q.  For a student and you never went to school?

   4            THE COURT:  Are you --

   5            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'm finishing up, your Honor.

   6            THE COURT:  I know you're finishing up, but don't

   7   finish up by being repetitious.

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'm trying not to.

   9   Q.  You took an oath to your first wife and then you violated

  10   that, didn't you?

  11   A.  I don't know what you mean by oath with wife?

  12   Q.  You married your first wife and without permission you

  13   went and married somebody in the United States, isn't that

  14   right?

  15   A.  What I tell you in our religion some scholars they say you

  16   marry the second one, you don't have to tell the first one.

  17   Some scholars say you should tell the first one you going

  18   to marry.  If she want to save you she can, if not, she got

  19   divorce.

  20   Q.  Second one advised you and you got married illegally?

  21   A.  No.

  22   Q.  In the United States?

  23   A.  No, we went to the church and all haka comes and we make

  24   the --

  25   Q.  But the church doesn't allow people to marry a second wife


 
                                                                1030

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   in the United States?

   2   A.  I still don't know.  I'm teenager, I don't know the law,

   3   and I don't know.

   4   Q.  You came and you took an oath to al Qaeda, didn't you?

   5   A.  Yes, bayat.

   6   Q.  And a number of things in there like not stealing you

   7   violated that oath, didn't you?

   8   A.  Yes, I stole some money.

   9   Q.  You went to the bank and promised to pay money back and

  10   you didn't?

  11   A.  This is Islamic National Front their problem, not my

  12   problem, because they say you going to bring the loan from

  13   Khartoum bank and they never did.  And that's why the problem

  14   with them.

  15   Q.  That wasn't your fault, right?

  16   A.  Well, I went to the manager of that Islamic University and

  17   he runs the business for Islamic National Front.  He give me

  18   letter to Dr. Masorji, manager Khartoum bank, and all they say

  19   we going to give you loan, we going to give you loan and when

  20   somebody tell me Abu al Masry.

  21            THE COURT:  This question is only going to lead to

  22   repetition.

  23   Q.  My question, your Honor, did not call for that whole

  24   answer.  I didn't want to interrupt him.

  25            Mr. Al Fadl, is there any oath that you've ever taken


 
                                                                1031

                               Al Fadl - cross

   1   in your life that you have kept?

   2   A.  Yes.

   3   Q.  What's that?

   4   A.  Muslim.  I do my prayer, and I believe God, I believe my

   5   prophet Mohammed.

   6   Q.  You select the oaths to your God that --

   7   A.  No.

   8   Q.  -- you decide to follow, isn't that right?

   9   A.  No.  When I join the al Qaeda a lot of al Qaeda group I

  10   it's not right job, some because it's good job, some because

  11   it's not good job.  When we are in Pakistan we have only some

  12   book, al Qaeda group we read, but when we went to Sudan it's

  13   more chance for me and other members they read other books,

  14   they enjoy other scholars, they go to its mosque and that's

  15   the difference when we reach Sudan, it's a lot of difference.

  20   you came to America?

  21   A.  Yes.

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would offer that

  23   exhibit again subject to redaction which we can discuss later.

  24            THE COURT:  Received without objection subject to

  25   redaction.


 
                                                                1034

   1            (Government's Exhibit 1 received in evidence)

   2   Q.  The other day Mr. Baugh asked you a question about whether

   3   or not you were aware that the Witness Protection Program

   4   expended approximately $794,000 on you and your family.  My

   5   question to you is, whether or not you are aware the medical

   6   expenses, the medical component of those expenses constituted

   7   approximately $308,000?

   8            MR. BAUGH:  Objection to the form.

   9            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Are you aware, sir, that just the expense for documents

  12   for you and your family totaled approximately $132,000?

  13   A.  Yes, if you --

  14            MR. BAUGH:  Objection.

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  You have to wait for the Judge.

  16   There was an objection:

  17            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  18   Q.  Yes, sir.  Please don't tell us what the medical expenses

  19   were for.  Is that for your family's medical expenses?

  20   A.  Because for my --

  21   Q.  Let's not get into the medical procedure.

  22   A.  Okay.

  23   Q.  Now, sir, we talked, you were asked questions about a

  24   fatwa, and you talked about whether the scholars agree or

  25   disagree and my question to you is this.  If the scholars


 
                                                                1035

                             Al Fadl - redirect

   1   within al Qaeda cannot agree among each other, if scholars in

   2   al Qaeda disagree, do they issue a fatwa?

   3            MR. HERMAN:  Judge, objection.  I assume he's going

   4   to answer based on his knowledge.

   5            THE COURT:  His knowledge and his understanding, yes.

   6   Q.  To your understanding, if the al Qaeda, if al Qaeda

   7   scholars, the scholars within al Qaeda disagree on whether

   8   something is Islamically correct or not, does al Qaeda issue a

   9   fatwa?

  10   A.  No, if they don't, if you're not agreed, they not issue

  11   fatwa.

  12   Q.  And if a fatwa is issued as an al Qaeda member, do you

  13   understand that the al Qaeda scholars agree on what has been

  14   issued?

  15   A.  Yes, they agree.

  16   Q.  Now, you were asked questions by Mr. Schmidt about

  17   confidentiality and you stated in response to questions that

  18   you were not told the reason that you were going to Hungary to

  19   meet with a person.  Do you remember those questions?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  And you did testify that you were told that the reason for

  22   going to Zagreb had to do with business, correct?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  So your understanding was that the business in Hungary was

  25   secret?


 
                                                                1036

   2   leading question.

   3            THE COURT:  Yes, sustained to the form of the

   4   question.

   5   Q.  Let me ask you this, sir.  What were you told about the

   6   person whom you were supposed to met in Hungary?

   7   A.  What I told from Abu Sarudi they told me when you go to

   8   the guest house, and somebody in our group he going to meet

   9   you over there, and follow what he tell you.

  10   Q.  So the person you were to meet was a Lebanese guy within

  11   your group, correct?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  Do you know whether or not that Lebanese person was Wadih

  14   El Hage?

  16   Q.  When was it that you went to Budapest?

  17   A.  What, the time?

  18   Q.  Yes.

  19   A.  I think during '92, maybe September '92.

  20   Q.  And do you know as you sit here today whether or not Wadih

  21   El Hage was traveling in Eastern Europe during September and

  22   the fall of 1992?

   4   A.  I don't know.  I really don't know.

   5   Q.  Now, you were asked questions by Mr. Schmidt as to whether

   6   or not you told the United States government hundreds of names

   7   during the course of three months of being interviewed and

   8   whether or not you did not mention the name of Wadih El Hage

   9   until October 23, 1997.

  10            Do you recall those questions?

  11   A.  Yes.

  12   Q.  Do you recall stating that you were not sure whether you

  13   had mentioned the name Wadih before that, do you recall that?

  14            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection.  That is not his testimony,

  15   your Honor.

  16            THE COURT:  Rephrase the question.

  17   Q.  Do you know whether or not you mentioned the name Wadia

  18   prior to the date that Mr. Schmidt gave you October 23, 1997?

  19   A.  I know I mentioned the name but I don't know when.  I

  20   don't know what year and what month.

  21   Q.  Let me approach you with what has been marked as 3501-45,

  22   page 146.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  3501-45, page 146.

  25            I ask you if that refreshes your recollection that


 
                                                                1038

   4            (Pause)

   5   A.  Yes.

   6   Q.  Now, you recall earlier Mr. Schmidt asked you questions

   7   about a discussion within al Qaeda as to whether or not you

   8   have an attack in Saudi Arabia that would kill civilians?  Do

   9   you recall those questions?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  He asked you whether or not a person from el jihad had

  12   propose the attack, do you recall that question?

  13   A.  Could she help me?

  14   Q.  I'll speak slower.

  15            (Witness consults with interpreter)

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  Who was the person within al jihad who proposed the attack

  18   in Saudi Arabia?

  19   A.  The guy he told me about he want to do something in Saudi

  20   Arabia about Muslims.

  21   Q.  And was Abu haf el Masry part of al Qaeda?

  22   A.  Yes, he's a second guy in committee.

  23   Q.  So he was both a member of al jihad and al Qaeda?

                                                                1039

   1   Schmidt that you were first told that if you joined al Qaeda

   2   you could only belong to one group.

   3            Can you explain to the jury how Abu haf el Masry

   4   could belong to both al jihad and al Qaeda?

   5   A.  Because the jihad group, the work for al Qaeda agenda and

   6   for jihad agenda, but always al Qaeda agenda first.

   7   Q.  If a person belongs to al jihad it's not considered a

   8   violation of a promise to only work for al Qaeda?

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor, leading

  10   question.

  11            THE COURT:  I know you're trying to watch the clock

  12   and I think it's causing you to ask leading questions.

  13            MR. FITZGERALD:  Okay.

  14   Q.  Could a person belong to both al jihad and al Qaeda?

  15   A.  If what I say you can't join another group, the other

  16   group they don't work for al Qaeda either, but like we have

  17   groups they work and they made bayat to al Qaeda agenda and

  18   jihad group, one of those groups.

  19   Q.  Now, you were asked questions earlier by Mr. Schmidt as to

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  Can you tell the jury how many people left al Qaeda when

   7   RECROSS-EXAMINATION

   8   BY MR. HERMAN:

   9   Q.  Mr. Al Fadl, you've been asked a lot of questions about

  10   fatwas and whether a fatwa can be challenged if it's not

  11   Islamically correct.  All right.  Let me just ask you this

  12   question.

  13            Did you say in a sworn affidavit that al Qaeda

  14   organization, and this is 3501-40, an affidavit which if you

  15   want to look at it I'm going to tell you that you signed it,

  16   so if you want look at it to refresh your recollection --

  17            THE COURT:  Finish your question.  Finish your

  18   question.

  20            Did you say the al Qaeda organization has members who

  21   made bayat swore to the emir the prince of the organization

  22   Usama Bin Laden?  That sounds like something you would say and

  23   swear to?

  24   A.  I didn't understand.

  25            (Witness consults with interpreter)


 
                                                                1043

   4            (Pause)

   5            Please restate your question.

   6   Q.  Here's the question, and if you need the interpreter, the

   7   al Qaeda organization had members who made bayat, that is

   8   sworn allegiance to the emir prince of the organization, Usama

   9   Bin Laden?

  10   A.  Yes.

  11   Q.  You understand that?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  You said that?

  14   A.  Yes.

  15   Q.  Did you say this?  By taking this oath the member obliges

  16   himself to follow those orders of Usama Bin Laden as long as

  17   they did not violate Islamic law?

  18   A.  Yes.

  19   Q.  Did you say that, yes or no?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21            MR. HERMAN:  That's all I have.  Thank you, sir.

  22            THE COURT:  Mr. Cohn.

  23   RECROSS EXAMINATION

  24            MR. COHN:

  25   Q.  On redirect Mr. Fitzgerald asked you whether or not a


 
                                                                1044

                           Al Fadl - recross/Cohn

   1   fatwa would be issued unless all the scholars agreed.  Do you

   2   remember that question and your answer to that?

   3   A.  Yes.

   4   Q.  And you said no, it would not.  Is that right, that all

   5   the scholars had to agree?

   6   A.  In al Qaeda group?

   7   Q.  In al Qaeda.

   8   A.  Yes.

   9   Q.  And that was generally known, was it not, that no fatwa

  10   would be issued unless all the scholars agreed that it was

  11   Islamically correct, is that right?

  12   A.  Yes.

  13   Q.  And that would be the power of the fatwa that everybody

  14   would know that the scholars, that the Islamic scholars all

  15   agreed that that was Islamically correct under the law.  Is

  16   that right?

  17   A.  Yes.

  18   Q.  And, therefore, there would be no reason to argue with

  19   that if you were somebody who actually heard the fatwa, right?

  20   A.  Yes.

  21   Q.  But to obey the fatwa you of course had to hear what the

  22   fatwa was, somebody had to communicate it to you, didn't they?

  23   A.  Yes.

  24   Q.  Thank you.

  25            MR. STERN:  We have no questions.

  22   in Khartoum, yes or no, Mr. Al Fadl?

  24   that had been discussed for retaliation against the United

  25   States because of the arrest of Sheik Abdul Rahman.  It's a

  19   house.

  20   Q.  Did somebody else tell you about those discussions?

  21   A.  We talk inside the guest house about that.

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection.

  23            THE COURT:  Yes.  Sustained.  Anything else?

  24            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  25   Q.  You seem to have remembered that --


 
                                                                1060

                          Al Fadl - recross/Schmidt

   1            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   2   Q.  In the end of 1993 how long was Mr. El Hage living in

   3   Khartoum?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, scope.

   5            THE COURT:  Sustained.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, he said the bachelor

   7   quarters.

   8            THE COURT:  Sustained.  Let's not get into an

   9   argument.

  10            MR. SCHMIDT:  He said the bachelor quarters were

  11   there for a short period of time.

  12            I'll rephrase the question.

  13   Q.  You said that the bachelor quarters were for single people

  14   there for a short period of time visiting Khartoum.  Is that

  15   correct?

  16   A.  Yes.

  17   Q.  How long had Mr. El Hage been in Khartoum by the end of

  18   1993?

  19   A.  What I remember I saw him in the guest house but later on

  20   I know he leave with somebody and he live in Rial City.

  21   Q.  Let me ask the interpreter to translate this.

  22            How long was Mr. El Hage living in Khartoum by the

  23   end of 1993?  Please interpret it.

  24   A.  I don't know how long.  I didn't count that.

  25   Q.  Didn't you say that you trained him in 1992?


 
                                                                1061

                          Al Fadl - recross/Schmidt

   1   A.  Yes.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Objection, scope.

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  I have no other questions.

   4            THE COURT:  Anything further of the witness?

   5            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, your Honor.

   6            THE COURT:  Thank you for your patience, ladies and

   7   gentlemen.  We'll resume tomorrow at 10 a.m.

   1            (Jury not present)

   2            THE COURT:  The next order of business is what?

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I would suggest that the

   4   next order of business will be I believe the government will

   5   offer in as CNN videotape from 1997.  We'll call an agent who

   6   will testify as to the authentication of certain items seized

   7   in the search of Mr. El Hage's apartment.

   8            THE COURT:  Now, with respect to the tape you plan to

   9   play the tape?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Mr. Karas can address that.

  11            MR. KARAS:  Yes, Judge, we're planning on playing the

  12   whole tape.

  13            THE COURT:  Any objection to the tape?

  14            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Yes, your Honor.

  15            THE COURT:  And what is the nature of the objection?

  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  Needlessly gory.

  17            MR. KARAS:  Just the interview.

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  I withdraw my objection.

  19            THE COURT:  No objection to the interview being

  20   played.  All right.  Then what happens?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  An agent who will testify as to the

  22   authentication of items seized in the 1997 search of Mr. El

  23   Hage's residence.  Again Mr. Karas is familiar with any issues

  24   that may be coming up on that.

  25            MR. KARAS:  Your Honor, we submitted a letter to the


 
                                                                1063



   1   Court regarding and in limine motion.  I don't know if there

   2   is any response to that.

   3            MR. WILFORD:  There is, your Honor.  Most

   4   respectfully, the government submitted a motion in limine by

   5   letter to the Court and has provided counsel with 3500

   6   material.  That 3500 material is severely redacted so what the

   7   government in essence did was make a motion granting the

   8   redacted material in advance without giving counsel an

   9   opportunity to review the material and make a decision on its

  10   own whether or not that particular material would be relevant

  11   to any areas of cross-examination which the counsel would like

  12   to go into.

  13            The government would have an opportunity to object or

  14   present to the Court particular areas of that testimony which

  15   they think are beyond where they're going, but for the

  16   government in advance to redact whole hog the entire witness'

  17   prior statements, I think didn't give us a fair opportunity.

  18            THE COURT:  Let me refresh my recollection and see if

  19   my recollection is correct.  The government took the position

  20   that the agent was being called for the sole purpose of

  21   authenticating various exhibits and that the government wanted

  22   a ruling that that was the sole limited purpose of the witness

  23   who was not subject to cross-examination with respect to any

  24   other matters unrelated to the authentication of the exhibit.

  25   Is that the letter we're referring to?


 
                                                                1064



   1            MR. KARAS:  Yes, Judge, the letter mentioned that and

   2   it specified four areas, and we like to exclude

   3   cross-examination.  Just so everybody is clear, the redactions

   4   do not reflect those concerns.  The redactions in the 3500

   5   material are only of things contained in the written document

   6   that are otherwise unrelated at all to the search, and that is

   7   separate and apart from the four issues we had raised in our

   8   in limine letter.

   9            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, there is no way for counsel

  10   to know whether or not those issues are relevant.  That's a

  11   decision that the government is making.  They may in fact be

  12   prior statements.

  13            THE COURT:  The government is making a representation

  14   to the Court that the matters redacted had no relevance to

  15   what the subject matter of the witness' testimony is going to

  16   be.  I will ask the government to submit to me by 9 a.m.

  17   tomorrow an unredacted copy so that I can look at that myself.

  18            MR. KARAS:  We have it right now.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  The only other issue with respect to the

  20   four areas that the government wanted to, the government in

  21   limine motion four areas with respect to of certain agencies

  22   which we don't have a problem with that.  We also don't have a

  23   problem with in terms of cross-examination as with respect to

  24   the legality of the Kenyan search not being an issue for the

  25   jury, but with respect with respect to the foreign


 
                                                                1065



   1   intelligence aspect of the search we have agreed I think with

   2   the government to reserve that issue for stipulation if in

   3   fact it become relevant.

   4            The fourth issue at the Kenyan warrant and the

   5   validity of warrant, and we would reserve the right to

   6   cross-examination not with respect to the legality of the

   7   search, but with respect to his credibility with respect to

   8   the issue of that warrant.  That is part of the 3500 material.

   9            THE COURT:  I don't understand.  This witness is

  10   going to testify on X day a warrant was executed and these are

  11   the documents seized as a foundation for their being offered.

  12            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, I'm not saying that we're

  13   going to cross him on the actual search.  I'm saying we want

  14   to reserve the right to use the material for credibility

  15   purposes.

  16            THE COURT:  Use what material for credibility

  17   purposes?

  18            MR. DRATEL:  The Kenyan warrant called for stolen

  19   property.  Suppose he had knowledge of that and knew that was

  20   false and he used the warrant anyway, it has nothing to do

  21   with the legality of the search.  It's the government's

  22   position that is set forth in the pretrial procedures with the

  23   Court was that they weren't relying on the Kenyan warrant, so

  24   that's why the Kenyan warrant has nothing to with the legality

  25   of the search, but does go to the agent's credibility should


 
                                                                1066



   1   we wish to attack it.

   2            THE COURT:  There is nothing in the world that can't

   3   sought to be justified as a basis for cross under the rubric

   4   of credibility, but assume for a moment the Kenyan warrant was

   5   a ruse.  How does that affect the credibility of the agent's

   6   testimony that documents 1, 2, 3 and 4 were seized in

   7   execution of that warrant?

   8            MR. DRATEL:  The other issue with respect to his

   9   description of the search, your Honor, I don't know what his

  10   testimony is going to be.  That's why I'd like to reserve

  11   that.

  12            THE COURT:  I'll revisit the question after his

  13   direct which I take it is all that you're asking that I do,

  14   but I think you know that you'll have a very heavy burden to

  15   establish for me that issues with respect to the legality of

  16   the Kenya warrant as a matter of Kenyan law are relevant to

  17   the credibility of the agent who is being called solely for

  18   purposes of identifying the results of the search.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  This agent has said in an affidavit he

  20   was presented with that warrant and our position is that he

  21   knew that that warrant was based on, that warrant was not,

  22   there was no stolen property, should not be granted and was

  23   not designed to get stolen property in the search.

  24            THE COURT:  And you believe that that circumstance

  25   should permit him to be cross-examined with respect to his


 
                                                                1067



   1   knowledge of the bona fides of the warrant so that the jury

   2   may consider the credibility of his testimony that the things

   3   being proffered are the things which resulted from that

   4   search.

   5            MR. DRATEL:  Not just the things being proffered,

   6   your Honor.  It's also his execution of the search itself.

   7            THE COURT:  I will permit you to revisit the issue

   8   prior to cross-examination.

   9            MR. KARAS:  Just so counsel is aware, we don't even

  10   intend on our direct to elicit that the Kenyans have for being

  11   on the premises for the reason that we don't think that the

  12   legality of the Kenya participation is relevant to the factual

  13   question that's presented by the introduction of the evidence.

  14   So we're not even going to get into that issue at all.

  15            THE COURT:  I'll revisit the issue after I've heard

  16   the direct.  We're only dealing with a permissible scope of

  17   cross, and not whether defendant can call the witness as its

  18   own witness as part of the defense case should that somehow be

  19   relevant.  Mr. Schmidt?

  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, I'm just leaning forward, your

  21   Honor.

  22            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, there is --

  23            THE COURT:  Let me just explore a moment.  I think

  24   the first order of business today was that you were reserving

  25   some right for further material following the


 
                                                                1068



   1   cross-examination of the last witness?  Is that all moot now?

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, it's not.  It's moot as to cross

   3   examination of this witness, but it is not moot as to

   4   production of documents, but we don't --

   5            THE COURT:  Would you let me have in writing what

   6   material you feel you are now entitled to have in light of the

   7   examination of this witness?  Can I have that by Friday

   8   morning?

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, if I may, depending on the

  10   following witnesses it may or may not require that.  If I am

  11   going to require the production of documents it would be

  12   documents that I would offer in the defendant's case which is

  13   not ripe yet, but I ask that we wait.  I really do need that

  14   because I don't need to do that extra work.

  15            THE COURT:  All right.  I want to avoid the problem

  16   of having to recall this witness from wherever he is or

  17   wherever he is going in the near future.  Since you tell me

  18   that it relates to the defendant's case.

  19            MR. WILFORD:  Yes, your Honor.  May I bring up

  20   scheduling concerns for the Court's attention?

  21            THE COURT:  Yes.

  22            MR. WILFORD:  Can we speak to the Court out of

  23   public?

  24            THE COURT:  You want to speak to me privately?  Any

  25   objection?  You want a reporter?


 
                                                                1069



   1            MR. WILFORD:  No, it's not necessary.

   2            (Discussion off the record in the robing room)

   3            (In open court)

   4            THE COURT:  That matter related to scheduling

   5   sometime next week.  Is there any matter that requires the

   6   Court's attention prior to bringing in the jury tomorrow

   7   morning?

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  There are still some discovery things

   9   that need to be resolved, some of which we're trying to

  10   resolve and some of them we think we may end up --

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, there are some other

  12   issues we're trying to resolve with the defense.  But we'll

  13   have that private squabble later.

  14            THE COURT:  All right.  Let's adjourn then till 9:45

  15   tomorrow.  I'll be here if we need anything further.

  16            (Adjourned to 9:45 a.m., Wednesday, January 21, 2001)
