<BR><B><I>The Characteristics of the Revolution In Kurdistan</I></B>

<P>The revolution in Kurdistan, which is led by our party, is a national
and a democratic revolution whose most important characteristics can be
described as follows:

<P>A) Our revolution has two fundamental aspects, namely one national and
one democratic. The national aspect takes aim at the rule of colonialism
in the political, military, economic, and cultural spheres. In its initial
phases, our revolution stressed this aspect. The national contradiction
is the main contradiction and determines the solution for the other social
contradictions. If the national contradiction is not resolved, there is
no possibility to solve the remaining social contradictions on their

<P>own. The first steps which were taken in the name of the revolution
were primarily national in character and they placed Kurdistan in a phase
of extensive revolutionary development. The second aspect of our revolution
is democratic. The democratic revolution aims to defeat the remaining social
contradictions which have been in place since the Middle Ages. These contradictions
include exploitation by feudal compradors, tribalism, religious conflicts,
and the slave-like suppression of women. As soon as these contradictions
are solved, the society will take on a democratic character.

<P>Both aspects of our revolution are closely tied to one another. The
democratic revolution develops in conjunction with the dominant aspect,
the national revolution. Likewise, the national revolution is closely tied
to the democratization of the society.

<P>B) Another characteristic of the revolution in Kurdistan lies in the
problem of leadership. The national and democratic revolution displays
two types of leadership: firstly, that of class, and secondly, the leadership
in the various geographical regions. As for class, the intensive struggle
between the feudal comprador class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the working
class has led to important results. The praxis of the national liberation
struggle has shown that the fundamental force which will lead to the victory
of the revolution is the unity between the workers and the peasants; the
leadership which will bring victory is the ideological, political, and
organizational leadership of the working class. The leading forces of the
other classes are steadily losing their power, and they can no longer pose
a serious threat to colonialism. On the other hand, there has been a steady
development in the leadership of the working class, which is embodied in
our party.

<P>Due to the division of Kurdistan into different parts, the leadership
in the various regions is also of significance. Previously, South Kurdistan,
despite its backwards social structure and relatively small geographical
area, represented the leadership and the potential for all of Kurdistan.
But the leadership there caused great damage and losses, and the national
liberation struggle in this region has not had any results. This stagnating
situation improved, however, following the rise of the national liberation
movement in the largest and most developed region of Kurdistan, the northwest.
The leadership in Northwest Kurdistan, whose struggle has been directed
against the Turkish Republic, has been characterized by gained and lasting
achievements.

<P>Our party, which presented a solution to both the question of class
as well as the question of the local leadership, has pushed the national
liberation struggle in a revolutionary direction by fighting against tendencies
such as bourgeois nationalism, national denial, and submission. The revolutionary
socialist leadership provided by our party will continue to lead the national
and democratic revolution, according to the line of the working class,
on a socialist path, without interruption.

<P>C) The third characteristic of our revolution is the long-term vision
of the struggle and the broad mobilization of popular forces. This has
manifested itself in praxis in the form of a protracted people's war. On
the basis of this long-term popular uprising, the use of all forms of struggle
are required. Only

<P>through such a means of struggle can the strong foundations of colonialism
be broken down and defeated. The struggle which is taking place, whose
practical realization is this line, has shown the correctness of this approach
through its significant revolutionary developments.

<P>D) The fourth fundamental characteristic of our revolution is that it
is not limited to Kurdistan, rather it has an influence on its surroundings
and on the entire region. That shows the universalism of our revolution.
This characteristic of our revolution can be explained by the fact that
it is a social revolution with a broad base, and that it continues to grow
stronger despite being in a world situation where there are developments
aimed against it. It affects the interests of all the nations in the region
due to the fact that Kurdistan is divided. This characteristic gives life
to our revolution and exerts an influence on the entire region; if things
continue to develop in this direction, our revolution will have an influence
at the global level as well.

<P><B>The Tasks Of The Revolution In Kurdistan</B><B></B>

<P>Our revolution is necessary to arrive, through socialism, at our ultimate
goal, namely a classless society. The revolution will realize the following
tasks:

<P>A) An end to Turkish colonialism and all forms of imperialist domination
over Kurdistan. In order to do this, the following must be achieved.
<UL>1) A national, united front of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and
other classes and sectors must be developed and expanded.

<P>2) In order to secure the complete organization of the population, associations
for workers, peasants, youths, women, and others must be further expanded.

<P>3) The people's war, the fundamental form of struggle against colonialism,
must continue on the path to victory, and its base organizations and people's
army must be further developed.

<P>4) Conflicts between the various population groups, which are continually
fueled by the colonialists and their local agents, must be stopped. Those
tendencies which aim at purely local or nationalist organizing must be
defeated.

<P>5) All attempts at "special regional status" or "autonomy" which do
not aim to break the colonialism of the Turkish Republic, and which in
fact are collaborations with colonialism, must be exposed and a decisive
struggle must be waged against them.

<P>6) The property of those people who collaborated with the colonialists
during the war and who acted against the people must be confiscated and
redistributed to poor and needy members of the society.

<P>7) We must create our own institutions of economics, culture, health,
and education in order to stop diseases and to fight against the other
forms of destruction of nature and people which have been brought about
by about by colonialism.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
B) A national, independent, democratic society, ruled by the people, must
be established. In order to do this, the following must be achieved:
<UL>8) The nationalization of all institutions, including factories, farms,
and other establishments, belonging to the colonialists.

<P>9) The abolishment of the colonialist financial and credit system, to
be replaced with an independent financial and credit system.

<P>10) There will not be any foreign military bases or other such privileges
anywhere in the country.

<P>11) Land reform must be carried out in the interest of the working class.

<P>12) All debts by farmers to creditors and banks will be annulled.

<P>13) As part of the democratization of the society, all hindrances to
the organization of working people in the economic, political, and cultural
spheres must be eliminated, and such organizations must be granted legal
status.

<P>14) New employment possibilities must be created for the workers, bearing
in mind that the physical and mental development of workers is of great
importance. Furthermore, the work day shall be 8 hours long.

<P>15) The colonialist legal system will be disbanded and replaced by a
democratic judicial system.

<P>16) All forms of oppressioagainst women will be stopped, and the equal
status of women and men in the society will be realized in all areas of
social and political life. Women, who possess an enormous social revolutionary
dynamic, will be mobilized towards this aim.

<P>17) All forms of oppression against minority groups, be they national
or religious, will be stopped; without lapsing into nationalism, all cultures
will be guaranteed cultural freedom; the various cultures in the country
will be viewed as a valuable asset.</UL>


<P>C) An independent economic structure must be built up. In order to do
this, the following must be achieved:
<UL>18) The economy will be centrally planned.

<P>19) Public ownership must be differentiated from state capitalism, and
state capitalism must be resisted. The guiding principle which is to be
realized is that in science, politics, and the production of the society,
you can only take as much as you give.

<P>20) In the realm of public property, an emphasis will be placed upon
the development of heavy industries.

<P>21) There will be public control over resources, transportation, trade,
finance, and means of mass communication.

<P>22) Farmers will be encouraged to form collectives and they will be
supported in this effort.</UL>


<P>D) In place of colonialist education and culture, a national educational
and cultural system must be established. All dialects of the Kurdish language
will be allowed to develop, although one will be made into the national
language. With respect to the Kurdish language, literature, and history,
intensive research will be carried out, and to aid in this, research institutes
will be created.
<UL>23) The entire population will be able to learn to read and write.</UL>


<P>E) For revolution and unity in Kurdistan, the following are needed:
<UL>24) The revolution in the various parts of Kurdistan is primarily the
task of the people living in those regions.

<P>25) Efforts at pushing through certain reforms under the guise of "autonomy",
using the means of the colonialist state, are to be resisted in all parts
of Kurdistan.

<P>26) Efforts must be made to increase the support and solidarity between
the revolutionary forces in the different parts of Kurdistan.

<P>27) Efforts must be made to bring success to the revolutionary line
in all parts of Kurdistan.

<P>28) The basis of unity will be the right to self-determination for the
people of all the various parts of Kurdistan.

<P>29) The democratic rights of Kurdish people spread out across the countries
of the world must be guaranteed. Kurds living abroad should join with progressive
humanity and with the struggle in Kurdistan. Preparations should be made
to facilitate these people's return home to Kurdistan.</UL>
F) With respect to relations with neighboring peoples and international
questions, we must apply the principles of proletarian internationalism.
In order to do this, the following must be achieved:
<UL>30) Due to the division of Kurdistan between different countries, all
relations with revolutionary forces among neighboring peoples will be based
on the assumption that all revolutionary movements are themselves responsible
for the revolution in their own country; on this basis, different forms
of joint struggle at various levels must be developed.</UL>

<UL>31) Unity with neighboring peoples must be based on the notion that
all peoples are independent and free. All forced unities which are not
based on this notion must be resisted. Relations with neighboring peoples,
in particular with the people of Turkey, will be developed within our vision
of a "Federation of the Middle East".

<P>32) Relations with independent countries and their national liberation
movements, cooperation with movements of the working class and revolutionary
forces across the world, and solidarity with democratic, anti-fascist,
environmental, and humanitarian circles must be built up.</UL>
