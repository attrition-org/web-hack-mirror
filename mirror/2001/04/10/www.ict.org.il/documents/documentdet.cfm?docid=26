<br><b>William J. Clinton, President of the United States</b>


<p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)("IEEPA"), the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States
Code,
<p>I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, find
that the actions and policies of the Taliban in Afghanistan, in allowing
territory under its control in Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven and
base of operations for Usama bin Ladin and the Al-Qaida organization who
have committed and threaten to continue to commit acts of violence against
the United States and its nationals, constitute an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,
and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
<p>I hereby order:
<p><b>Section 1.</b> Except to the extent provided in section 203(b) of
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)) and in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses
that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date:
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>(a) all property and interests in property of the Taliban; and
<p>(b) all property and interests in property of persons determined by
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State
and the Attorney General:</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>(i) to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf

<b>Sec. 2. </b>Except to the extent provided in section 203(b) of IEEPA
(50 U.S.C. 1702(b)) and in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses

<blockquote>(a) any transaction or dealing by United States persons or

<p>(c) the importation into the United States of any goods, software, technology,

United States Government. All agencies of the United States Government
are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority

<p><b>Sec. 6.</b> Nothing contained in this order shall create any right
