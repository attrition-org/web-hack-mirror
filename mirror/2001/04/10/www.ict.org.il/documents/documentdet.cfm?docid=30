<CENTER><H3>The real evidence denies the lies of the Palestinian
Authority


<br>We demand the trial of all those involved in the
crime<br>and an apology to the people and the blood of
the martyrs</H3></CENTER>

<p></P>

<b>Our Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic Nation:</b>

<P>With supersonic speed, as fast as the PA has blamed the noble ones,
the real evidence has also revealed, clear as the sun, the lies of the
PA - so the truth is revealed.

<P>The words of the commander, `Adel `Awadallah and of the family of the
detained Ghassan `Adassi, have undoubtedly proved the involvement of PA
security officials in the liquidation of the Martyr Muhi al-Din al-Sharif
to the benefit of the Zionist enemy. Afterward they also circulated accusations
against the Heroes of Qassam to pave the way for their persecution and
liquidation, at the request of the enemy government and its humiliating
terms.

<P>The family of the detained Ghassan al `Adassi has testified that he
did not leave his home while the criminal assassination occurred, and that
his four brothers were arrested and locked in different cells and were
coerced to confess to the accusations of the PA. They were threatened with
being accused of cooperation with Israel if they would not comply. The
family and the brothers rejected those accusations and refused to cooperate
with the PA in this string of lies, despite their torture. The PA succeeded
in forcing their younger brother Ghassan `Adassi to circulate the false
accusations in order to minimize his torture. The family has named Jibril
Rajoub, al-Tayyib `Abd al-Rahim and ‘Isma`il Jabr as participating in their
interrogation to force them to accept the line of the PA and its falsehoods.

<P><B>In order to reveal the truth, the PA should do as follows:</B>
<OL>
<LI>
Immediate release of all Hamas members arrested in this case, after the
truth and their innocence had been uncovered.</LI>

<LI>
Dismiss from its ranks all those involved in the criminal assassination
of the fighter Muhi al-Din al-Sharif for the Zionist enemy, and first and
foremost Jibril Rajoub.</LI>

<LI>
Dismiss from its ranks all those involved in the scandal of inventing accusations
against the heroes of the movement, in particlular, besides Jibril Rajoub,
al-Tayyib `Abd al-Rahim and Isma`il Jabr.</LI>

<LI>
Publish an open apology to the people for this double crime. They not only
looked for the blood of the Heroes but, tried to falsify their Jihad to
justify the continuance of their crimes against them.</LI>
</OL>
<P></P>
<B>Our Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic nation</B>

<P>Our mouth will remain filled with water and we shall refrain from revealing
the further facts we have, in an attempt to preserve the unity and not
provide any opening for the enemy. At the same time we emphasize to the
Palestinian Authority that we possess more facts and information than you
can imagine in the case of the liquidation of Muhi al-Din al-Sharif and
the accusation of the commander and fighter `Adel `Awadallah. But, we prefer
unity to revenge and we shall bury this information in respect for of the
people’s blood and interest.

<P>If the PA insists on continuing its false accusations and putting the
accused on trial, it will only lead the complete Authority to be drowned
in this marsh, and to lose its reputation in this scandalized case.
