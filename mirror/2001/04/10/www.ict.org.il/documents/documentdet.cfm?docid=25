<br><b>President William J. Clinton</b>


<p>I have signed an Executive Order imposing financial and other commercial
sanctions on the Afghan Taliban for its support of Usama bin Ladin and
his terrorist network.&nbsp; The Taliban has allowed the territory under
its control to be used as a safe haven and base of operations for Usama
bin Ladin and the Al Qaida organization, who were responsible for the bombings
of our embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania last year,
murdering 12 Americans, nearly 300 Kenyans and Tanzanians and wounding
another 5,000.&nbsp; To this day, bin Ladin and his network continue to
plan new attacks against Americans, without regard for the innocence of
their intended victims or for those non-Americans who might get in the
way of his attack.
<p>The United States has tried repeatedly, directly and working with other
governments, to persuade the Taliban to expel bin Ladin to the United States
for trial or, if that is not possible, to a third country where he will
face justice for his crimes, and to end the safe haven it gives to bin
Ladin's network, which lives and trains in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
These efforts have failed.
<p>The Executive Order I have signed will deepen the international isolation
of the Taliban, limit its ability to support terrorist networks and demonstrate
the need to conform to accepted norms of international behavior.&nbsp;
The Order does not affect humanitarian aid, food and medical supplies for
civilian use.&nbsp; It is not aimed at the people of Afghanistan, but at
the Taliban.&nbsp; Those who nurture terrorism must understand that we
will not stand by while those whom they protect target Americans.
