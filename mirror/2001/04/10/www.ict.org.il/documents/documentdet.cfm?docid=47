  18            (In open court; jury not present)

  19            THE COURT:  Good morning.  Please be seated.  We have

  20   a number of matters I'd like to cover.  It's not the first

  21   item in terms of the agenda, but so I don't forget, so that

  22   there is no confusion with respect to the cross-examination of

  23   Al Fadl, and I do this because there was a request on behalf

  24   of counsel for El Hage for another conference to deal with

  25   that, I just want to make sure that there is an understanding



                                                                688



   1   what the ground rules are.  I'm aware that some of this

   2   relates to some classified material and we're in open court.

   3            The cross-examination of the witness with respect to

   4   such matters as his understanding of the Koran, of the terms

   5   of the bayat and so on, is to be conducted by asking him

   6   direct questions without references to any documents not in

   7   evidence.  If in the opinion of counsel the answer given

   8   requires resorting to any documents, including the specially

   9   prepared documents which was the subject of our robing room

  10   conferences --

  11            MR. BAUGH:  Excuse me.  Your Honor, I don't mean to

  12   interrupt.  I don't believe there are any Swahili interpreters

  13   in the middle group.

  14            THE COURT:  Excuse me?

  15            MR. BAUGH:  I don't believe there are any Swahili

  16   interpreters in the middle group.

  17            (Pause)

  18            THE COURT:  A sidebar is to be requested.  Let me say

  19   that I will be very surprised should that occasion arise where

  20   you have had the example of two cross-examinations of the

  21   witness, including inquiry into those matters and there seemed

  22   to be no problem in eliciting the witness' responses.  Should

  23   that arise, there is to be request for a conference.  I will

  24   reluctantly, but if necessary, grant that conference.

  25            At that conference we will deal with a number of



                                                                689



   1   matters.  One, whether there is indeed need for a reference to

   2   the document in question.  Two, whether the government will

   3   take the position that the nature of that inquiry will open

   4   the door on the concept of completeness for the government to

   5   make reference to other portions of those documents; and

   6   three, an opportunity of co-counsel to object as they have

   7   indicated in the past they would.

   8            That is the protocol which we will follow, if

   9   necessary.  I say I will be surprised if it is necessary.  Is

  10   there any question as to the procedure with respect to that

  11   matter?

  12            MR. DRATEL:  No, your Honor, but what we were

  13   intending to do, your Honor, is to give you a letter, probably

  14   tomorrow, just highlighting what we think if that comes up,

  15   just to highlight for the Court what might be.

  16            THE COURT:  I have a letter request on behalf for an

  17   order for a curative instruction with respect to the reading

  18   of exhibit 1600T.  My understanding of 1600T is that is an

  19   exhortation by Bin Laden to his audience to engage in

  20   anti-American terrorist activity, and that as evidence of that

  21   he cites the vulnerability of the United States as evidenced

  22   by, among other things, Somalia.  Page 35:  Appear before the

  23   world promising to retaliate but his promises were only

  24   preliminary things for withdrawals.  God humiliated you and

  25   you left, and this had seriously shown that you're incompetent



                                                                690



   1   and weak.

   2            In other words, my understanding of the context of

   3   this is a reference by Bin Laden to the victories, the

   4   successes achieved as a result of other terrorist acts.  He

   5   doesn't claim responsibility for these acts, but he cites them

   6   as examples of the sort of activity which has achieved

   7   success, success being a humiliation and withdrawal by the

   8   Americans.

   9            Does anybody quarrel with that as a fair

  10   characterization of what Bin Laden is doing in those portions

  11   of this document?

  12            All right.  Silence then is acquiescence.  In light

  13   of that, Mr. Wilford, what is it that you would have me tell

  14   this jury?

  15            MR. WILFORD:  That these statements contained in

  16   1600TT are reflective of Bin Laden's state of mind and they

  17   are not reflective of the state of mind of Mr. Odeh.

  18            THE COURT:  Mr. Bin Laden is not an individual.  He's

  19   not -- he is, you know, we talk about the pyramid and he's the

  20   top of the pyramid, right?  This is in 1996.

  21            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, the statements that he's

  22   making at that time are reflective of his state of mind.  What

  23   the jury ultimately gets to determine is whether or not Mr.

  24   Odeh or any of the other defendants agreed or accepted that,

  25   and the statement that is made and the way that the government



                                                                691



   1   suggested it, according to Mr. Karas yesterday, was that it

   2   was coming in simply to show what Bin Laden's state of mind

   3   was and what he hoped to have people believe.

   4            THE COURT:  You want me to say that exhibit 1600 is a

   5   statement issued by Bin Laden distributed by people working

   6   for him which constitutes the declaration of holy war against

   7   the Americans.  You want me to tell that to the jury?  I have

   8   no difficulty telling that to the jury.  I don't imagine the

   9   government would have any difficulty my telling that to the

  10   jury.

  11            MR. WILFORD:  I request what is suggested in my

  12   letter.

  13            THE COURT:  Not for the truth contained therein.

  14            MR. WILFORD:  Yes.  Because the government's proffer

  15   of this particular piece of evidence, your Honor, was that

  16   it's being offered for the state of mind.  I wouldn't want

  17   jury to be confused and being misled as to what the document

  18   is being offered for, and I don't want confusion to occur

  19   later on in terms of argument of this particular document.

  20            THE COURT:  You go on to say -- I'm reading the last

  21   paragraph -- therefore, Mr. Odeh requests that the jury be

  22   instructed that Government Exhibit 1600 and 1600T were

  23   admitted not for the truth contained therein, but rather to

  24   establish what Bin Laden's state of mind was and the message

  25   he had for his followers at that time.



                                                                692



   1            MR. WILFORD:  Message he had for his followers, not

   2   that his followers accepted that message, but that's the

   3   message he was putting forth.

   4            THE COURT:  How does that differ from any other

   5   statement made by a coconspirator in furtherance of the

   6   conspiracy?

   7            MR. WILFORD:  Well, there are instances where the

   8   statement is more than, it's an agreement between the parties.

   9   The statement can be offered as evidence of agreement between

  10   the parties.  This is not that sort of situation.

  11            THE COURT:  This is an instruction which he, this is

  12   a fatwa which is a declaration of holy war.  Exhibit 1600

  13   constitutes a statement issued by Bin Laden reflecting his

  14   views and the message he had for his followers.  You want me

  15   to say that?

  16            MR. WILFORD:  Yes.

  17            THE COURT:  Any objection to that?

  18            MR. KARAS:  One moment, your Honor.

  19            (Pause)

  20            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, I would not want the part

  21   about message he had to his followers.  Also, with respect,

  22   it's our position, but, also, if I could just go back to

  23   Somalia for a second, because just reading it again and while

  24   the specific language in the fatwa does not take credit, if

  25   examined in the context of what the government is trying to



                                                                693



   1   establish with respect to Somalia, it does have an impact on

   2   Somalia.

   3            If the government is going to put in, has put in

   4   through Mr. Al Fadl already, and I anticipate that they will

   5   try to put it in through other statements, not only by Bin

   6   Laden but also by another alleged coconspirator is that al

   7   Qaeda was responsible, so to put that with this it doesn't go

   8   very far to determine the statement of responsibility, and

   9   that's why it's a factor.

  10            Your Honor, also, it can also have an impact to the

  11   jury, that the other issues on Somalia in another context and

  12   it has an impact on what our judgment of our needs are.

  13            THE COURT:  It's what he said, right?  It's what he

  14   told his followers.  He said:  Look how we humiliated

  15   President Clinton and how they withdraw, and this is the sort

  16   of thing you should do to achieve the glorious martyrdom that

  17   he describes.

  18            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, in terms of the actual, I

  19   don't know if your Honor is saying that's the instruction or

  20   the Somalia part of it now?  If you're talking about

  21   instruction, my objection to the part about the followers is

  22   that it's a fatwa and whatever fatwa is, it is.  I don't want

  23   to be part of an instruction that it's a fatwa.

  24            THE COURT:  I really think that for the instruction

  25   to be fair and accurate it will not show any interest of the



                                                                694



   1   defendants, because as you say in your letter, Mr. Wilford,

   2   this is a message he had for his followers at the time.  I

   3   don't see any stretching, that would be a fair and accurate

   4   appraisal of what this document is would be appropriate.

   5            Mr. Cohn, what is your client's views on this matter?

   6            MR. COHN:  He takes no position.

   7            THE COURT:  You take no position.

   8            MR. COHN:  I join the application, your Honor.

   9            THE COURT:  The application for a curative

  10   instruction?

  11            MR. COHN:  Yes.

  12            THE COURT:  A curative instruction which will say,

  13   among other things, that this is the instruction, the fatwa,

  14   the declaration of holy war issued by Bin Laden and

  15   constitutes the message he had for his followers at that time.

  16   You want that instruction.

  17            MR. COHN:  Not in those words, your Honor.

  18            THE COURT:  Those are the words of the request.  I

  19   have to say this.  I do know that there is a very

  20   understandable desire on the part of counsel from time to time

  21   to get an adverse ruling from the Court for the sake of

  22   getting an adverse ruling from the Court.

  23            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, just so we're clear, I'm not

  24   objecting to the instruction, but I think an instruction that

  25   says this is the speaker's state of mind, it is not the state



                                                                695



   1   of mind of any of the defendants; it is not proof of their

   2   state of mind; it is the speaker's state of mind.  I think

   3   that's consistent with an instruction with respect to any

   4   coconspirator hearsay.  The coconspirator hearsay is designed

   5   to --

   6            THE COURT:  Are you under the impression that it's

   7   appropriate for the Court after every introduction of a

   8   coconspirator's statement in furtherance of the conspiracy to

   9   give an instruction to the jury?

  10            MR. DRATEL:  No, but with something as important as

  11   this document, with so much prejudicial information I think it

  12   is appropriate in this content.

  13            THE COURT:  Mr. Wilford.

  14            MR. WILFORD:  Your Honor, also, we agree with

  15   Mr. Dratel's statement, not every time, but this particular

  16   statement it would be important.  If the Court is not inclined

  17   to give any instruction, I simply ask that the letter that I

  18   submit be made a Court Exhibit.

  19            THE COURT:  Sure.  Court Exhibit 1 of today.

  20            (Marked Court Exhibit 1 of 2/15/01)

  21            THE COURT:  One other matter with respect to the

  22   opinions that were filed under seal on Monday, I'm sure our

  23   friends in the media would appreciate it if they became

  24   available early tomorrow morning so that if you could let us

  25   know by 4:30 today, whether there is anything that has to be



                                                                696



   1   redacted.

   2            MR. COHN:  Your Honor wanted it in writing so we'll

   3   have it for you by then.  The changes we have are very minor.

   4            MR. KARAS:  Judge, just two things with respect to

   5   the declaration of jihad.  One is on page 35 at the very top

   6   there is a word there spelled R-A-Y-E-H-R-I-C-S.  As bad as my

   7   pronunciation has been I don't think that's a word.  I think

   8   it's supposed to be media theatrics, not media racist.  Page

   9   35 at the very top.

  10            THE COURT:  Media theatrics you think that is.  You

  11   know there are a few other instances.

  12            MR. KARAS:  The other thing, your Honor, is when

  13   there is a reference to PBUH I've been reliably informed that

  14   stands for peace be upon him.  That's how we will read it from

  15   here on out.

  16            THE COURT:  Ask them to bring in the jury.

   2            THE COURT:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  When

   3   we adjourn today we are going to adjourn until Tuesday

   4   morning.  It's the last of our February long weekends.  It's

   5   been a while since I reminded you not to read or listen to

   6   anything in the media, and this may be a good time for me to

   7   remind you again that that is the standing instruction.

   8            We are at the point where we are reading the

   9   Government Exhibit 1600T, copies of which you should have, and

  10   I believe we stopped yesterday at the bottom of page 16.

  11            MR. KARAS:  Yes, Judge.

   1            THE COURT:  If you would just pass those forward,

   2   they will be collected.

   3            MR. FITZGERALD:  There may be one logistical issue

   4   for counsel before the next item, so I wonder if we might take

   5   the break earlier.

   6            THE COURT:  Take a break now?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.

   8            THE COURT:  We'll take a five-minute recess.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  If next proposal is we intended to

  12   read the 1997 Grand Jury transcript of Wadia El Hage, but I

  13   received a call just before I came to Court this morning from

  14   Mr. Schmidt -- Mr. Karas received a call -- indicating that he

  15   was going to propose some redactions to the Grand Jury

  16   testimony and that's why I didn't want to stand up and go

  17   there.  We haven't received the redactions yet, I don't

  18   believe.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  I'm going to call him.  He was working

  20   on it while we were here.  This is something that just came up

  21   yesterday for the first time.  So I have -- I mean, I have

  22   gone through it myself, but if I could just go downstairs and

  23   call him.

  24            THE COURT:  We'll take a ten-minute recess.

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  My sense from the discussion of the



                                                                699



   1   redactions from Mr. Schmidt, but not Mr. Dratel, is I don't

   2   think we will be agreeing.  So I just wanted to warn your

   3   Honor.  But we'll try, but I think there's a serious issue.

   4            (Recess)

   5            (In the robing room; present:  Mr. Fitzgeral, Mr.

   6   Karas, Mr. Dratel, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Ricco and Mr. Wilford)

   7            THE COURT:  A big surprise that this is arriving so

   8   it's got to be decided two minutes while the jury is waiting.

   9            MR. COHN:  Do not look at us, your Honor.  Call

  10   Typhoid Mary.

  11            THE COURT:  What is the problem?

  12            MR. DRATEL:  We have some sections of the Grand Jury

  13   testimony that we would like redacted.

  14            THE COURT:  On the theory that?

  15            MR. DRATEL:  403, more prejudicial; there's very

  16   little probative value, if any, and they are highly

  17   prejudicial.

  18            THE COURT:  And bear no relationship to the perjury

  19   counts in the indictment?

  20            MR. DRATEL:  They are not alleged as perjurious

  21   statements in the indictment.  I know that some of them --

  22   there may be two that are referred to, one I think vaguely and

  23   another more specifically in the indictment, and our position

  24   is that it's just simply too prejudicial to -- but they're not

  25   perjury counts in the indictment.  What I'm saying is there



                                                                700



   1   are a couple I think that are referred to within the broader

   2   contours of the conspiracy.  The government knows better about

   3   that.

   4            THE COURT:  Are they being offered against all of the

   5   defendants or only against El Hage?

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Only against El Hage.  As an

   7   example, your Honor, one of the things --

   8            THE COURT:  Even if they are not subject, a subject

   9   of a specific count, why would they not be admissible as

  10   against him as admissions?

  11            MR. DRATEL:  Because they're not admissions.  He says

  12   no.  A lot of answers are "no," so it's really the question

  13   that's the issue.

  14            THE COURT:  Give me your best shot.

  15            MR. DRATEL:  Well, can we go through them.  Most of

  16   them don't have to do with things that are in the indictment,

  17   so I would like to proceed that way.  First, I'll read out the

  18   section, the government will say whether they agree or not

  19   agree, then we will know whether we have to argue.

  20            The first one we've resolved, which is page 2 --

  21            THE COURT:  Just tell me things you haven't resolved.

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Just for the purpose of knowing what's

  23   going to come in and not come in.  We've resolved fewer, so

  24   it's actually probably easier.

  25            Page 2, line 23, through page 3, line 3, there is a



                                                                701



   1   question put to Mr. El Hage about John Draid, D-R-A-I-D.  I

   2   think the government's agreeing that --

   3            THE COURT:  Page 2?

   4            MR. DRATEL:  Bottom of page 2.

   5            THE COURT:  Oh, yes.

   6            MR. DRATEL:  Through the top of page 3, and I think

   7   the government has agreed that it will stipulate that they're

   8   not contending that Mr. El Hage ever used that alias.

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  And I'll interrupt the reading by

  10   the paralegals to state that at that point in time, if that's

  11   easier.

  12            THE COURT:  Very well.  Okay.

  13            MR. DRATEL:  Page 18, line 13 through 22.

  14            THE COURT:  Page 18, line 30 --

  15            MR. DRATEL:  13 through 22.  And that is a photo

  16   presented to Mr. El Hage which he does not recognize, but he

  17   says -- well, I'm sorry, he does recognize it.  He says, "I

  18   don't remember the name, but I have seen his picture in the

  19   news.  He is the one involved in the World Trade Center

  20   bombing."

  21            I think that's too prejudicial, since he does not

  22   know the person other than through the media.

  23            THE COURT:  But then he continues, he goes through --

  24   it's 13 to 22.

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Right, because the second question is --



                                                                702



   1            THE COURT:  What is --

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, I don't see what the

   3   prejudice is.  He looked at a picture --

   4            THE COURT:  What's the point?  He doesn't remember

   5   the name but he's seen his picture.

   6            Granted, 13 through 22.

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  The problem we're going to have,

   8   Judge, since I just got these redactions now, is we've scanned

   9   in the Grand Jury testimony so we could do it with the jury

  10   and I just got the redactions now, so I don't know what we're

  11   going to do about displaying this to the jury.

  12            I don't see what the prejudice is to someone saying,

  13   I saw a photograph of a guy on T.V. but I don't know him, and

  14   we're not going to argue that he in fact knew him.

  15            THE COURT:  We'll just orally instruct the jury to

  16   disregard it.

  17            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor --

  18            THE COURT:  What do you want me to do?

  19            MR. DRATEL:  The fact that their technology can't

  20   accommodate this should not be why we --

  21            THE COURT:  How many of these are there going to be?

  22            Do you have copies of these for the jury?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  We were going to display it on the

  24   screen page-by-page.

  25            THE COURT:  Don't display that page.  Just read that



                                                                703



   1   page.  I think the fact that the technology shouldn't override

   2   the substance is a good point.

   3            Next.

   4            MR. DRATEL:  Page 19, line 11, through page 21, line

   5   23.

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.

   7            MR. DRATEL:  This is with respect to Mr. El Hage's --

   8   the question of Mr. El Hage with respect to Sayyid Nosair.

   9   This is one of the ones where there is a reference in the

  10   indictment not specifically, but there is a reference.

  11            The problem we have is just that the Nosair,

  12   particularly New York, is so prejudicial because there was

  13   involvement in the Kahane murder, and in fact the Kahane

  14   murder is mentioned specifically at page 21, line 5.

  15            THE COURT:  Mr. Wilford is smiling because what he

  16   would say if he weren't so deferential to co-counsel is your

  17   assumption as to what will be immediately known to the jury is

  18   not -- if he went in there and he asked who was Sayyid Nosair,

  19   no one would know.

  20            MR. COHN:  That wasn't why Mr. Wilford was laughing.

  21   He was thinking about lunch.

  22            THE COURT:  The jury is going to be taken to a fancy

  23   restaurant.  So that's to make up for the day they're being

  24   subjected to.

  25            Overruled.



                                                                704



   1            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, can we at least take out 21,

   2   line 2 through 21, line --

   3            THE COURT:  Page 21?

   4            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, page 21, line 2, through page 21,

   5   line 16?

   6            THE COURT:  Yes.  How about that?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge --

   8            THE COURT:  Yes, what is the probative value of his

   9   knowing that Nosair is in jail?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  First all, we'll be offering proof

  11   at this trial that he visited Nosair in jail, which he didn't

  12   admit because he visited Nosair in jail with a man by the name

  13   of Elnore, who he denies knowing one of the photographs of the

  14   people he says he doesn't know.

  15            THE COURT:  That's different.

  16            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, but that can be involved

  17   with lines 1, 2 -- 2 through 4, rather.  We don't need 5 and

  18   beyond.  Where is he now?  He's in jail.  That satisfies that.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  I think, Judge, what we're now doing

  20   is stripping away the facts as to why Mr. El Hage might want

  21   to lie.

  22            THE COURT:  No, overruled.  Leave it in, subject to

  23   the government's representation that there will be other proof

  24   of his visiting him.

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, he never lied, he never --



                                                                705



   1            THE COURT:  What's next?

   2            MR. DRATEL:  He did not ask whether he ever visited

   3   Nosair and says no, he never asked that question.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  He lied about knowing Elnore, who he

   5   visited with, and he asked whether he saw him in New York and

   6   he said in Brooklyn.  He never mentioned traveling to Rikers

   7   Island.

   8            THE COURT:  Next.

   9            MR. DRATEL:  The next is page 27, line 25 -- I'm

  10   sorry, page 27, line 17 through 25.  That's another reference

  11   to Nosair as well as to Abouhalima, who is a convicted

  12   defendant in the World Trade Center bombing.  There are two

  13   questions --

  14            THE COURT:  Overruled.  Next.

  15            MR. DRATEL:  Page 30, line 18 through line 23,

  16   there's a question that Mr. El Hage answers "no" which has to

  17   do with someone who visited him in the Sudan whose name he

  18   didn't remember, and the question is:  "Did anyone indicate to

  19   you that he was on the run from anyone who was looking for

  20   him?

  21   "A.  No."

  22            That would be what we would -- and the next

  23   question --

  24            THE COURT:  Then he says --

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, then the next question as well.



                                                                706



   1            THE COURT:  Then he says, "I thought he was sent by

   2   the American Embassy to check on me probably."  Was that with

   3   respect to the same person?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

   5            MR. DRATEL:  Yes.  But wait, that's the next page,

   6   but the part that we were looking at was before that.

   7            THE COURT:  Yes.

   8            MR. DRATEL:  Which is, "Did anyone indicate to you

   9   that he was on the run from anyone who was looking for him?"

  10   Answer:  "No."  Next question:  "Did anyone indicate he was

  11   wanted by any authorities?"  Answer:  "No."

  12            That's the portion that we think is more prejudicial

  13   than probative, or there's no probative value.

  14            THE COURT:  Is the next series of questions with

  15   respect to the same person?

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  17            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  18            MR. DRATEL:  Next were page 37, line 5 --

  19            THE COURT:  How many are there of these?

  20            MR. DRATEL:  There are about five more.

  21            THE COURT:  Page 37?

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Line 5.

  23            THE COURT:  Yes.

  24            MR. DRATEL:  Through page 47, line 25.  And that is a

  25   whole discussion of Mr. El Hage's relationship with Abouhalima



                                                                707



   1   who is a convicted defendant in the World Trade Center

   2   bombing, has to do with Mr. El Hage's purchase of weapons from

   3   Mr. Abouhalima that he never picked up.

   4            This is not charged as a perjury count.  None of

   5   these are charged as perjury counts.  It's very prejudicial.

   6   Interspersed within this is discussion of the fact that he's

   7   in jail for the World Trade Center bombing and that there's

   8   also a question about whether these weapons were for use at

   9   the JDL, which Mr. El Hage denies knowing about, and so that's

  10   why we would ask that this be deleted.

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, among other things,

  12   during this conversation where Mr. El Hage is asked about

  13   Abouhalima, he first says, "I never had a special discussion

  14   with Abouhalima.  Then he's confronted with the fact that

  15   Abouhalima called him to ship weapons to New York, and then he

  16   admits to that.  I think it goes to his pattern of showing he

  17   can't answer the questions.

  18            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  19            MR. DRATEL:  Page 36, line 14 through page 36, line

  20   22, which is purely:

  21            "Do you know where Abouhalima is today?

  22            "He is in jail.

  23            "Do you know what he is in jail for?

  24            "He is accused of the World Trade Center bombing.

  25            "So he is in jail for the World Trade Center bombing?



                                                                708



   1            "Yes."

   2            I don't think there is any reason for that to be in,

   3   your Honor, even under the government's theory.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  The government's theory is, knowing

   5   that what the person being investigated or being asked about

   6   is involved for, he is accused of being involved in the World

   7   Trade Center, it's truthful answers.

   8            THE COURT:  It makes it more -- the conclusion that

   9   the answers are deliberately false is enhanced by the

  10   notoriousness of the person about whom the questions have been

  11   answered.

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  13            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  14            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, can we get an instruction

  15   that the World Trade Center was not part of this case,

  16   something like that?  You know, that this is not --

  17            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, it already is not part of

  18   this case.  Already we've had --

  19            Hold on.

  20            We've had two things happen.  In the opening,

  21   Mr. Schmidt told the jury that the government --

  22            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Are the defendants praying

  23   now?

  24            MR. COHN:  No, they're sitting outside waiting.

  25            THE COURT:  Why don't they pray now?



                                                                709



   1            MR. COHN:  Because nobody suggested it until your

   2   Honor, in its wisdom.

   3            THE COURT:  Look, we'll be another five minutes?

   4            MR. DRATEL:  I think that we will be, yes, another

   5   five to ten minutes, I think, just to be --

   6            THE COURT:  Tell the marshals.  Is it all right if I

   7   tell the jury, since they are going to be read to again, that

   8   the jury should understand that we have adjusted the schedule

   9   somewhat to take care of Mr. Schmidt's indisposition?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  11            MR. DRATEL:  We're talking about the World Trade

  12   Center.  Obviously, without this, we don't need the

  13   instruction, but because this is reference number three,

  14   basically, to the World Trade Center now, with this and so --

  15            THE COURT:  So what would your instruction be?

  16            MR. DRATEL:  That the World Trade Center is not

  17   charged in this conspiracy.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  But what it may be relevant to is

  19   the perjury case as to whether or not he's telling the truth

  20   about the World Trade Center.

  21            MR. DRATEL:  That's notice charged as part of this

  22   conspiracy.  No one is being charged with involvement in the

  23   World Trade Center bombing.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Can we also instruct the jury if El

  25   Hage lied about people involved in that event, that's relevant



                                                                710



   1   to the perjury counts?

   2            MR. DRATEL:  I don't think we need an instruction on

   3   that.  I think the government can argue that.

   4            THE COURT:  Suppose I said, apart from possible

   5   relevance to the perjury counts against El Hage --

   6            MR. DRATEL:  I almost would rather have nothing than

   7   that.

   8            THE COURT:  Yes.

   9            MR. DRATEL:  But just my question is, why does the --

  10   the government's going to argue that no one can argue the

  11   opposite.  In other words, the government can argue that

  12   because -- the government can argue that it is relevant and we

  13   can't say -- I mean, what can we say in response other than

  14   that he didn't perjure himself?

  15            MR. FITZGERALD:  We are not going to argue that he

  16   blew up the World Trade Center.  It's reciprocal.

  17            MR. DRATEL:  Well, but there is one inference, and

  18   our inference is nowhere in front of the -- in other words,

  19   it's sort of a one-sided inference.

  20            THE COURT:  I can't say it's irrelevant because it

  21   clearly is relevant to the perjury charge.

  22            MR. DRATEL:  I didn't say irrelevant, that it's

  23   irrelevant to say -- the Court has decided it's relevant.

  24            THE COURT:  You want to say that the bombing of the

  25   World Trade Center is not --



                                                                711



   1            MR. DRATEL:  Charged in this case and no defendant

   2   is --

   3            THE COURT:  Is not charged against any defendant in

   4   this case?

   5            MR. DRATEL:  Right.

   6            THE COURT:  You have any problem with that?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  No.

   8            THE COURT:  I'll do that first time there is a

   9   reference to the World Trade Center.

  10            MR. DRATEL:  Thank you, your Honor.

  11            Okay, the others, the JDL reference at 46, line 2 to

  12   line 9 as part of the same piece.

  13            THE COURT:  Which page are we on now?

  14            MR. DRATEL:  46, line 2.

  15            THE COURT:  Page 46, line 2.

  16            MR. DRATEL:  Through line 9.

  17            THE COURT:  "Did Abouhalima ever tell you that the

  18   guns were to be used to fight against the Jewish Defense

  19   League?

  20            "No.  He never said that."

  21            From lines 1 to where?

  22            MR. DRATEL:  Through 9, the two questions, the two

  23   answers.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, again, the Grand Jury's

  25   investigating what the guns were going to be used for in New



                                                                712



   1   York.  We had a good faith basis to ask that question.  He

   2   said no.  That goes to materiality of what he is discussing

   3   about these weapons, which he claims, first, he didn't mention

   4   in response to Abouhalima; second, he claims he never shipped.

   5            THE COURT:  No, I sustain the objection to page 46,

   6   lines 1 through 9, and we'll follow the same procedure --

   7   don't flash that page on the screen.

   8            MR. COHN:  You want a report, Judge?  They can pray

   9   during lunch.  We don't have to delay at all and it's fine.

  10            Judge, don't ask me to be logical.  I'm just merely

  11   the messenger.

  12            THE COURT:  But there is a pattern developing about

  13   how things are important only if the Court denies them.

  14            MR. COHN:  Judge --

  15            THE COURT:  Okay.

  16            MR. COHN:  Prayer is a floating time, depending on

  17   the position of the sun.

  18            THE COURT:  But I have a calendar on my desk with an

  19   explanation from the imam.

  20            Let's go on.

  21            MR. DRATEL:  The next one we have agreed on, I think,

  22   which is --

  23            THE COURT:  Fine.

  24            MR. DRATEL:  Can I say what the agreement is so we're

  25   clear that the government will state during the course of the



                                                                713



   1   deposition, page 56 through 61, which discusses the murder of

   2   Mustafa Shalabi that there's no contention that Mr. El Hage

   3   was involved in any way.

   4            THE COURT:  And the government will say that?

   5            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

   6            THE COURT:  Very well.  Okay.

   7            MR. DRATEL:  The next is a large section, page 72,

   8   line 23, to page 90, line 15, which involves the murder of an

   9   imam in Tucson by the name of Rashad Khalifa.

  10            THE COURT:  Yes.

  11            MR. DRATEL:  And it's not charged in the perjury

  12   count.  The government's position is that it is relevant

  13   because they are going to contend that the same person who

  14   Mr. El Hage visited Nosair with is the same person who visited

  15   Mr. El Hage in Tucson.

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            MR. DRATEL:  Well prior to this murder.  So the

  18   question is really no connection between the murder and this

  19   visit, other than what the government is going to try to draw

  20   an inference without saying, because there have been people

  21   who have been charged with this murder, with conspiring to

  22   murder.  They live in Colorado in their --

  23            THE COURT:  What is the relevance of the murder?

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, specifically, the Grand

  25   Jury did charge that one of the material facts for the Grand



                                                                714



   1   Jury to determine, and I'll read from the indictment at page

   2   108, subsection 6:  "The nature of the role, if any, played by

   3   defendant Wadih El Hage in the murder of Rashed Khalifa in

   4   Tucson, Arizona in 1990 and the identity of the person in from

   5   New York who visited Wadih El Hage in Tucson prior to the

   6   murder."

   7            It's the government's contention that the person who

   8   came from New York, who Mr. El Hage would lie about after

   9   being shown this photograph and whom he would then visit

  10   Nosair in jail with in 1991, was involved in the surveillance

  11   prefatory to a murder, not necessarily the murder.  Mr. El

  12   Hage lied about it, explains why he lied about it.  It goes

  13   directly to materiality and was charged in the indictment.

  14            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  15            MR. DRATEL:  Okay.  I just want to say I don't think

  16   the government is going to have any proof that there's any

  17   connection between this visit and the murder.  It's just, I

  18   think, an unfair inference that's totally prejudicial to

  19   Mr. El Hage.

  20            THE COURT:  My ruling is made on the representation

  21   of the government, and if there should be no -- well, but it's

  22   what the Grand Jury was inquiring into which defines what was

  23   material for purposes of their inquiry.

  24            Overruled.  Let's move on.

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, also within that I think we



                                                                715



   1   have an agreement that there's part of page 85 that will go

   2   out.

   3            You don't agree?

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  No.

   5            MR. DRATEL:  I thought you were agreeing.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  I wrote down I understood your

   7   argument.

   8            MR. DRATEL:  Page 58, lines 22 to 24, which is really

   9   just exchange between Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. El Hage.

  10            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  11            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, I think that's extremely

  12   prejudicial.  That has no relevance to anything.

  13            THE COURT:  Overruled.

  14            MR. DRATEL:  There's also within that section, page

  15   81, line 15 -- I guess I missed this one.  It has to do with

  16   Mr. El Hage possessing a weapon in Texas and it has nothing to

  17   do with that issue.  It just is within that.  It says, "Do you

  18   have a gun?"  "Yes, I have a shotgun."

  19            THE COURT:  A shotgun in Tucson.  What is the

  20   significance of that?

  21            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, a lot of -- this is the first

  22   time I'm hearing this one.

  23            MR. DRATEL:  I forgot to mention it.  It's on the

  24   same line.  I'm sorry.

  25            MR. FITZGERALD:  He asked him if he had a gun in the



                                                                716



   1   house, he had a shotgun.  I don't --

   2            THE COURT:  Take it out.  Take it out and don't

   3   screen that page.

   4            MR. DRATEL:  Page 107, line 2 through 4.

   5            THE COURT:  Page 107,lines which?

   6            MR. DRATEL:  2 through 4.  That's again an issue as

   7   to why a particular defendant is in jail.  I don't know that

   8   the government is even alleging that he's lying about this

   9   person Azmarai, and the question is why that's relevant.  Just

  10   the fact that he's in jail and he's in jail for the World

  11   Trade Center.

  12            THE COURT:  We're going to have the World Trade

  13   Center stipulation that will cover.

  14            MR. DRATEL:  Then page 115, line 5.

  15            THE COURT:  115?

  16            MR. DRATEL:  Line 5.

  17            THE COURT:  Line 5.

  18            MR. DRATEL:  Through 116, line 22.

  19            THE COURT:  Yes.

  20            MR. DRATEL:  Which is a recap by Mr. Fitzgerald of a

  21   variety of different situations that involve fatalities and

  22   then try put Mr. El Hage connected with them, and it's really

  23   like a summation, it's really argument, your Honor.  It's a

  24   series of questions about that, recap of earlier testimony,

  25   and it's just -- it's unnecessary.  It's all there already.



                                                                717



   1   It's prejudicial, sort of summation.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, a couple of things.

   3   First of all, it is telling the witness directly what he is

   4   saying and giving him an opportunity to give a truthful

   5   answer, which is he was asked if he ever thought he was being

   6   part of a terrorist group, and he said no.  Even at the end of

   7   the Grand Jury testimony he's asked if there is a single

   8   answer he wanted to change anywhere in his testimony, and I

   9   think it's important when --

  10            THE COURT:  Yes, the objection is overruled.  I'm

  11   cutting you off because I think what you are about to say is

  12   clear.

  13            You are the questioner?

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  That's been redacted.

  15            THE COURT:  That's been redacted.  That will not be

  16   disclosed to the jury.

  17            MR. DRATEL:  One additional one, page 120, line 26.

  18            THE COURT:  120, line?

  19            MR. DRATEL:  26, through 122, line 8.

  20            THE COURT:  To line 8, that he heard about -- what's

  21   the significance of that?

  22            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, we had offered a

  23   stipulation that no one in the case was charged with

  24   participating in the Mubarak assassination.

  25            MR. DRATEL:  Okay.  I guess I forgot.



                                                                718



   1            THE COURT:  Okay.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Okay.

   3            THE COURT:  All right.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  So we can do it at the same point in

   5   time.

   6            THE COURT:  Is that it?

   7            MR. DRATEL:  That's it.

   8            THE COURT:  And I will tell the jury that the reason

   9   why they're having a day of reading is because we're working

  10   around Mr. Schmidt's unavailability.  And this will take how

  11   long?

  12            MR. FITZGERALD:  Take the balance of the day.

  13            THE COURT:  The balance of the day.

  14            MR. FITZGERALD:  It's 183 pages.  Sans redaction,

  15   175.

  16            MR. DRATEL:  And if you granted more, it would be

  17   shorter.

  18            (In open court; jury present)

  19            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, two things:  One is

  20   I want to explain the longer recess we had and the fact that

  21   there's going to be some more reading and explain that,

  22   although we made a commitment to try not to waste your time,

  23   we have had to do a little reshuffling because of

  24   Mr. Schmidt's flu.  So please understand why that has taken

  25   place, and we are doing every effort, making every effort not



                                                                719



   1   to waste your time.

   2            I'm told that the next order of business will be the

   3   reading of sections of the questioning of the defendant El

   4   Hage before the Grand Jury, which is relevant to the counts in

   5   the indictment naming the defendant El Hage and accusing him

   6   of committing perjury before the Grand Jury.

   7            These are the perjury counts in the indictment which

   8   are Counts 287 to 308, and understand, then, this testimony is

   9   admissible and is relevant only to the defendant El Hage.  I

  10   think that's the first occasion in which I have advised you

  11   that testimony is not being received, is not admissible for

  12   all purposes, but for a limited purpose, the limited purpose

  13   being with respect to the defendant El Hage and with respect

  14   to the perjury counts of the indictment, 287 through 305.

  15            I'm also handed a stipulation which says that if

  16   called as a witness -- remember I told you there are two types

  17   of stipulations, one is as to facts and the other is as to

  18   what a witness would say if the witness were called, and this

  19   stipulation is that, if called as a witness to testify,

  20   Careyann Rosenblatt, an official Grand Jury reporter for the

  21   Southern District of New York, would testify that Exhibit 400

  22   is a true and accurate transcription of the proceedings before

  23   a Grand Jury in the Southern District of New York, which took

  24   place on September 24, 1997.

  25            It is further stipulated and agreed that Government's



                                                                720



   1   401, 402, 403A through 403A5, 404 through 410 are copies of

   2   the Grand Jury Exhibits 1 through 10 referenced in that

   3   testimony.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  Thank you, Judge.  At this time the

   5   government would just offer those exhibits referred to in the

   6   Grand Jury testimony with the exception that to the extent

   7   photographs are looked at but not recognized, we will not

   8   offer those exhibits.

   9            THE COURT:  Very well.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  So, for the record, that would be

  11   Exhibits 401, 402, and 403D, H, L, M, N, O, P, Q, Z, AE and

  12   AG, and as to those exhibits just the specific photographs are

  13   referred to, which has page 2 on it, and then Government

  14   Exhibit 405, 409 and 410.

  15            (Government Exhibits 401, 402, and 403D, H, L, M, N,

  16   O, P, Q, Z, AE and AG, and 405, 409 and 410 received in

  17   evidence)

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  And we will proceed by having

  19   paralegal specialist Abigale Sada and Gerrard Francisco will

  20   read the transcript into the record, with Ms. Sada doing the

  21   introduction or time and the questions by the questioner, and

  22   Mr. Francisco will provide the answers.  And there are also

  23   three other stipulations between the government and counsel

  24   for El Hage which I will interrupt the reading to recite that

  25   stipulation at the appropriate point.



                                                                721



   1            THE COURT:  All right.  Understand, ladies and

   2   gentlemen, that the answers are being given by a paralegal.

   3   His demeanor, his inflexion is irrelevant.  It's simply to

   4   speed the process that is taking place.

   5            Very well, you may proceed to do that.

   6            MR. FITZGERALD:  Also, Judge, we'll be displaying the

   7   pages on the screen, with the exception of I think three pages

   8   for which there had to be a change.  So there will be three

   9   pages that won't be displayed on the screen, but otherwise the

  10   jury will be able to follow along.

  12   "Q.  Who introduced you?

  13   "A.  No one.  I just went to the office and met him there.

  14   "Q.  What brought you there?

  15   "A.  I was traveling to Pakistan and I was to pick up some

  16   money and aid that's going to the refugees over there.

  17   "Q.  Did you get any money from Shalabi?

  18   "A.  No, he didn't give me any money.

  19   "Q.  Did you ask him for money?

  20   "A.  No.

  21   "Q.  Why did you laugh?

  22   "A.  Why would I ask him for money?

  23   "Q.  Wasn't Shalabi in charge of raising money in New York for

  24   the Afghani refugees?

  25   "A.  Yes.



                                                                767



   1   "Q.  You were going to bring money to Afghani refugees in

   2   Afghanistan?

   3   "A.  Yes.

   4   "Q.  Wouldn't you normally ask the person in charge of the aid

   5   in New York, ask him for money?

   6   "A.  I thought you said if I ask him for myself.

   7   "Q.  Okay.  I meant money for you to bring to the refugees.

   8   "A.  Yes.

   9   "Q.  Did he give you any?

  10   "A.  No, he didn't.

  11   "Q.  Why not?

  12   "A.  For some reason he didn't want to send it at that time.

  13   Maybe it wasn't ready.  I did not discuss this with him.  I

  14   just, I think I waited a day or two for my flight, for my next

  15   flight to Pakistan.

  16   "Q.  When did you next see Mustafa Shalabi?

  17   "A.  On my way back.

  18   "Q.  And did you conduct any business with Mustafa Shalabi at

  19   that time?

  20   "A.  No.

  21   "Q.  How many times total did you meet with Mustafa Shalabi?

   1   Pakistan, the second time was on your way back, correct?

   2   "A.  No.  No.  Then there must be more than two times because

   3   I met him after that.

   4            "Only two times, right.  Once I was going, the second

   5   I was coming back.

   6            "I was supposed to meet him again in '89 just before

   7   he died.  I am not sure he died in '89 or in '90, but it was

   8   my last visit, I was supposed to go and meet him, but he was

   9   killed before I met him.

  10   "Q.  Forgetting the last time when you didn't meet him because

  11   he had been killed, were the first two meetings with Shalabi,

  12   did you ever give him anything or did he ever give anything to

  13   you?

   1   "A.  Not necessarily.  Other people working there.

   2   "Q.  Do you recall their names?

   3   "A.  No.

   2                             2:15 p.m.

   3            (In open court; jury not present )

   4            THE COURT:  Mr. Fitzgerald, what do we do on Tuesday

   5   if Mr. Schmidt should not be recovered?

   6            MR. DRATEL:  Your Honor, he'll ready.

   7            THE COURT:  What's the next order of business?

   8            MR. FITZGERALD:  After Al Fadl, your Honor, the next

   9   order of business involves El Hage, but we need to work out

  10   submissions on which witness we go with next, the search of El

  11   Hage's premise in 1997.  Mr. Karas has been talking to

  12   Mr. Dratel about submissions.

  13            THE COURT:  If something should happen on Tuesday, I

  14   want there to be another witness and go forward.  I don't want

  15   to have a break.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, Judge.  Here is the issue,

  17   Judge.  The witness we wish to call, I understand there may be

  18   submissions from El Hage.  We're waiting to hear back.  We

  19   took this witness out of order and posed several other El Hage

  20   witnesses so the problem is, we don't know where we go yet

  21   until we hear back.

  22            MR. DRATEL:  We have to have the 3500.  Before we do

  23   that, we don't know what the nature of our position is.

  24            MR. FITZGERALD:  We have a search agent and a

  25   computer agent, agents who seized computers and translations



                                                                771



   1   and we have potential Somalia proof that I know Mr. Karas has

   2   been talking to Mr. Dratel about the issues concerning the

   3   search agents, the agents seizing the computer, the computer

   4   experts downloading the material and then the translations.

   5            THE COURT:  If there is anything that is going to

   6   require a ruling by the Court, is there any reason why that

   7   can't be presented to me by 10 o'clock tomorrow?

   8            MR. DRATEL:  Yes, I think so, because two reasons

   9   why.  One is that I'm not sure what issues we want to be

  10   handling in what order.  Somalia we'll be able to get to the

  11   government our position on Somalia probably by sometime

  12   tomorrow morning is my guess.  There is more than just us.

  13   There is another team that is involved as well, so that

  14   involves communication in that regard.  But the first issue is

  15   combing and until we receive the 3500.

  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  The 3500 will be ready today.  Mr.

  17   Karas is looking at it now.  My understanding is Mr. Karas and

  18   Mr. Dratel already talked about certain issues independent of

  19   the 3500 material that might come up.

  20            MR. DRATEL:  It's a question of whether we're going

  21   to cross on certain topics but until we see the 3500 I don't

  22   know what is in there.  But the other question about computer

  23   experts that is something.  It has to do with mirroring of the

  24   hard drive from the computer that was seized in Nairobi and

  25   there was a problem with replicating that in New York, so we



                                                                772



   1   need to know what we're going to do about it.

   2            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, my only point being this

   3   grand jury testimony was supposed to be about three weeks from

   4   now.  There are a number of outstanding issues that we waited

   5   for and we jumped ahead.

   6            THE COURT:  Now we know about Tuesday, and we know

   7   that Mr. Schmidt may very well decide that two hours of

   8   cross-examination is more than enough.  Then what happens?

   9            MR. FITZGERALD:  My only point is, your Honor, we've

  10   been trying to put the 3500 material, but the witnesses keep

  11   changing because we've had issues with regard to search

  12   engine, computer engine or with Somalia.

  13            THE COURT:  It's one or the other or a third and you

  14   can give them all three and you can have all three of them

  15   lined up.  You know when it gets to be August an September and

  16   the jury weary and you are weary, and I'm weary, we're going

  17   to look back at times when things could have moved in a more

  18   rapid pace.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  Judge, I don't think we're going to

  20   see August and September, first.  And part of the problem what

  21   we told you is if we don't know if there is a stipulation or

  22   something and we don't have an answer whether the Somalia

  23   witness is in or out, we try to work, but we have to hear

  24   back.  We're stuck.

  25            THE COURT:  I understand.  I understand Mr. Schmidt



                                                                773



   1   getting the flu which is contrary to a court order which threw

   2   things off, but I do really want to have continuity.

   1            (Jury present)

   2            THE COURT:  Good afternoon.  We continue with the

   3   reading of Government Exhibit 400 which are the grand jury

   4   minutes of examination of defendant El Hage and I believe we

   5   ended up, we're on page 56, line 25.

   6   "Q.  Now, there came a time when you said that you were going

   7   to see Shalabi in some year, just before he was killed?

   8   "A.  Uh-huh.

   9   "Q.  Can you tell the grand jury the circumstances under which

  10   you decided to go to New York on that occasion?

  11   "A.  He called me in Dallas and asked me to come over to take

  12   care of the office while he goes to Pakistan for about two

  13   weeks so I agreed on that.  So the day I went there he called

  14   me.  I told him I will arrive at a certain time for him to

  15   meet me.  When I arrived at the airport he wasn't there so I

  16   called the office and Zindani was there.  He came and picked

  17   me up and then we went to the office.  We waited for Shalabi

  18   to show up.  He didn't show up.  Then either the next day or

  19   the day after, we found out that he was killed.

  20   "Q.  Did you learn how he was killed?

  21   "A.  Not exactly but he was, I think he was tortured or was

  22   cut with knives.

  23   "Q.  When you learned he was tortured and cut with knives,

  24   were you curious as to who did it?

  25   "A.  Yes.



                                                                775



   1   "Q.  What did you do about who it was that killed Shalabi?

   2   "A.  There were different opinions.  Some said probably the

   3   Mossad, the Israeli intelligence.  Some say it is the CIA.

   4   Some others say it is the people of Omar Abdel Rahman.  It was

   5   different opinions.

   6   "Q.  Now, when he called you before you showed up in New York

   7   and you discovered shortly after that he was dead, he called

   8   you in Texas, although you had only met him, met twice in your

   9   life?

  10   "A.  Uh-huh.

  11   "Q.  And he asked you to run the Services Office while he was

  12   in New York while he was in Pakistan?

  13   "A.  Yes.

  14   Q.  Had you heard rumors in the community that Mustafa Shalabi

  15   was not trusted at that point in time?  Before you came to New

  16   York did you hear people saying that Shalabi could not be

  17   trusted?

  18   "A.  No.

  19   "Q.  Have you heard any rumors he was taking money from the

  20   Services Office for himself?

  21   "A.  There was, after.

  22   "Q.  You heard that afterwards but not before?

  23   "A.  Yes.  Yes.

  24   "Q.  Did you hear any dispute between Shalabi in New York and

  25   the Mektab al Khidemat office in Pakistan as to how Shalabi



                                                                776



   1   was handling link money?

   2   "A.  No.  The dispute was in the office, here in the New York

   3   office.

   4   "Q.  And you heard about the dispute after Shalabi was killed?

   5   "A.  Yes, in those two days that I stayed in the office.

   6   "Q.  Now, when you were invited to go to New York, how long

   7   did you think you were going to stay running the Services

   8   Office while Shalabi was in Pakistan?

   9   "A.  15 days as we agreed.

  10   "Q.  And what did you think would happen at the end of the 15

  11   days?

  12   "A.  He would come back and I'd go back to Texas.

  13   "Q.  Did you call anyone before you came to New York to tell

  14   them that you were coming to New York to help run the Services

  15   Office for Shalabi while I was in Pakistan?

  16   "A.  I don't recall calling anyone.

  17   "Q.  By the way, was the Services Office in New York also

  18   known as the Al Kifah in New York?

  19   "A.  Yes.

  20   "Q.  When you saw Zindani at the airport how did he treat you?

  21   "A.  Normally.

  22   "Q.  Did you have any discussions with Zindani as to why it

  23   was you were coming to New York to run the Services Office

  24   while Shalabi was away?

  25   "A.  No.  I did not.



                                                                777



   1   "Q.  Did Zindani ever indicate to you that Shalabi had been

   2   thrown out of the Services Office and had no right to ask you

   3   from Texas to run the Services Office?

   4   "A.  No.  He didn't know I was coming to take over the office.

   5   "Q.  Did you ever tell him you were coming to take over the

   6   office?

   7   "A.  No.

   8   "Q.  As far as you know did he ever learn that you were coming

   9   to take over the office?

  10   "A.  I don't know.

  11   "Q.  Did he ever yell at you about that Zindani?

  12   "A.  No.

  13   "Q.  Did he ever throw you out of the office and say, don't

  14   come back, you weren't supposed to be here?

  15   "A.  No.

  16   "Q.  When Shalabi was killed where was his wife and family at

  17   the time?

  25   "Q.  As you sit here today do you know who killed Mustafa



                                                                778

  22   that you came from the Sudan?

  23   "A.  I was trying to keep this secret in Kenya when I was

  25   very good between Kenya and Sudan, and the Sudanese

  22   that?

  23   "A.  Haroun has nothing to do with Madani al Tayyib.  I am

  24   saying I don't remember whether I talked to him or not because

  25   I only saw him once when Madani came and talked to me.  Haroun



                                                                842



   1   saw him then in my office.

   2            "So they don't know each other.  Haroun doesn't have

  13   "Q.  How far is it from your office or your building?

  14   "A.  It is about 20 minutes' drive.

  15   "Q.  And why did Haroun remove files from your office and

  16   bring them to Mercy International?  Because he learned that

  17   Madani al Tayyib was talking?  Did he tell you why he took the

  18   files out?

  19   "A.  When I asked, I didn't know why he did that.  When I

  20   asked him, he said it was afraid -- well, in fact, it had the

  21   different letters written between my office and Sudan because

  22   the people that I dealt with in Sudan after I moved to Kenya,

  23   they were dealing with me and different business issues.

  24   "Q.  You told this Grand Jury five minutes ago you didn't

   2   various authorities.  Now you are telling this Grand Jury he

   3   has a very detailed conversation with you explaining why it is

   4   he removed files.

   5            "You understand you can go to jail for five years a

   6   hit every time you tell a lie to this Grand Jury.

   7            "Do you understand that?

   8   "A.  I understand.  I don't think I contradicted what I said

   9   before.

  10   "Q.  You had a conversation, did you not, with Haroun?

  11   "A.  Yes.

  12   "Q.  About Madani al Tayyib talking, correct?

  13   "A.  We did not discuss about Madani al Tayyib.

  14   "Q.  He just happened to pick that day to remove the files

  15   from your office when your boss starts talking?

  16   "A.  When he heard about Madani al Tayyib speaking and he knew

  17   that Madani al Tayyib was in Sudan, he thought that -- he just

  18   got scared and he decided to take any files that we had

  19   transactions with the Sudan.

  20   "Q.  Did he show you the files?

  21   "A.  No.

  22   "Q.  What did he ask you about what to do with the files?

   5   guard and the guard went to his village.

   6   "Q.  And he took the files?

   7   "A.  No.  They don't know where he put the files.

   8   "Q.  Did you make any efforts to try and track down where the

   9   files were?

  10   "A.  Yes.  We tried to call him where he lived for three, four

  11   days, until we finally got him.  He said he gave it to someone

  12   else.

  13   "Q.  The guard gave the files to someone else?

  14   "A.  Yes.

  15   "Q.  Why did the guard give the files to someone else?

  17   Mercy International.

   1   "Q.  Was anyone home when you went by Ahmed Sheik's house?

   2   "A.  I didn't go to his house.  I was told at the Mercy

   3   International that he is not in his house and there is no use

   4   going there, so we didn't even try to go there.

   5   "Q.  As you understood it now, your files, you believe, are in

  23   is that Usama Bin Laden said things that should not be said at

  25   good in front of people who are looking at him as an example.

  14   connections, so I called Abu Ibrahim and told him to send, to

  15   ask him to call me.

  16            "So then Abu Ibrahim talked to me about this.  He

  17   said, did you hear this thing on CNN?
