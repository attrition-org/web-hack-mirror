  15   government, and he say he don't want to stop that.  And he say

  16   we think the better way, to kill this guy because he give the

  17   government hard time, and most of the Sudanese people believe

  18   what he say, what his lecture, in the Friday prayer or through

  19   the newspaper.

  20   Q   What did he want you to do?

  21   A   He want me and he want Abu Musab to be close to the Umma

  22   Party to make relationship, and he say when you start this

  23   relationship, tell them we don't have anything with the

  24   Islamic National Front, we quit working with the al Qaeda

  25   group and Islamic National Front and we love to be with Umma



                                                                376

   2   Q   When he told you to tell the Umma Party that you had left

   3   the al Qaeda group and had nothing to do with the National

   4   Islamic Front, was that in fact true?

   5   A   No, because he say if you don't told them that, they going

   6   to find anyway, so tell them that and I need you for few weeks

   7   till this over, don't come to the guesthouses, don't come to

   8   the companies, just stay home, make relationship with him, and

   9   we don't need them to know you have any relationship.

  10   Q   What did you do?

  11   A   I remember me and Musab, we went to somebody named Abdel

  12   Mahmababo.  He is one of the Umma Party member and he is very

  13   close to Saddiq al Mahdi.  We got different meeting with him,

  14   and he told us about what the group live, what the politic is,

  15   about the religion, about Islam, about relationship between

  16   Islam and Christian and Shia and that.

  18            Did you eventually ever have a meeting with Saddiq al

  19   Mahdi himself?

  21   Q   Tell us what happened.

  22   A   If you me explain a little bit something before that's

  23   make more clear.

  24   Q   What happened before?

                                                                377



   1   30 questions.  He say study these questions clear and try to

   2   memorize, and you have the chance to see Saddiq al Mahdi, try

   3   to ask him those questions, and we need you to be careful with

   4   the answer.  Whatever answer he say, when the meeting finish

   5   and you went far from his house, try quick put all answer he

   6   say, and we going to sit down and we need the answers.

   7   Q   So what happened when you had the meeting with Saddiq al

   8   Mahdi?

   9   A   We went to his house with somebody, his name was Mutwakal.

  10   This is the first time I saw him, first time I sit down with

  11   him, and he say I hear you working for Afghanistan and he kick

  12   the Russia out and that's great job, and he say he went to the

  13   Iran before and he liked if the Muslims come together, Sunni

  14   and Shia.

  15            After that we asking him what you think about the

  16   what going on in Sudan now, and he said Islamic National

  17   Front, sometimes they make agreement with our party but they

  18   break the agreement, sometimes they work together, sometimes

  19   we split, and he said I did with them 30 years, and he say

  20   sometimes our group make relationship with them but later on

  21   they break their promise.  And he say it's better for the

  22   Sudan if all the group come to together and make one

  23   government, and he say since 1956 when the Sudan government

  24   run the country, there is no government, bring all Sudanese

  25   people together.



                                                                378



   1   Q   Those questions that you were given by Dr. Abdel Munim al

   2   Khabir did you ask those questions of Saddiq al Mahdi during

   3   the meeting?

   4   A   Yes, and one of the questions we ask him what you think,

   5   the south of Sudan 5 or 6 million Christians, the north of

   6   Sudan 20 or 25 million Muslims, what do you think about this

   7   relationship?  Do you think if the subjects better or if the

   8   government in Khartoum gives the Christian confederation.  And

   9   he say if we came together and we try that before, he say he

  10   didn't think so, the life is going to be good for both of

  11   sides.  And he say also, if we give them separate government,

  12   they don't have enough school, they don't have enough people

  13   to run the government, and he say the system over there is

  14   tribe system, he afraid if we give them separate, they going

  15   to fight each other, and Rwanda, Kenya, African middle

  16   countries, they going to come and involved with that.  He say

  17   the best way if we give them confederation and help build the

  18   schools and make the people know how to run the government and

  19   after that, until we help them to build education, and when

  20   they do that we give them separate government, their own

  21   government.

  14   Saddiq al Mahdi to make relationship with him to start

  15   something, unite all the groups of Sudan to run the

  16   government, but Saddiq al Mahdi, he don't like that because we

  17   change the government during his time, and he say some people

  18   say if we kill him is better for Sudan, because Saddiq al

  19   Mahdi got relationship with other countries, and any time we

   8   Q   What did you tell Abu Fadhl al Makkee when he first

   9   confronted you?

   1   start the al Qaeda group and we cannot believe you did that.

   2            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'm sorry, I didn't understand the

   3   first part of that answer.

   4   A   He say --

   5            THE COURT:  Madam Reporter, read the last two

   6   sentences, back.

   7            (Record read)

   8   A   And I told them I did it and I asked forgive and I try my

   9   best to bring the money back.  And they asked me, we want to

  10   know and Abdallah Bin Laden, he want to know what the reason,

  11   because you know you make bayat to al Qaeda and we know you

  12   good person, you fight hard for Afghanistan, why you need the

  13   money?  We want to know why you need the money.

  14            And I told them I know for fact some people, they

  15   took commission from when they do business for al Qaeda, and I

  16   know there is Egyptian people, they got more chance, they got

  17   more salary than other people.  And we talk with Bin Laden

  18   before and we talk with Abu Fadhl al Makkee before about that,

  19   and I know another people, they got more salary than me and

  20   other people and we start the al Qaeda before them.  And we

  21   talk about that a lot and there is no one listen, and it come

  22   a time I feel I have to do something for myself.

  23   Q   Did you pay back --

  24   A   And they say this is not, there is no reason here to do

  25   that.



                                                                387

   4   A   No.

   5   Q   And when you didn't pay the back the money, did you have

   6   further meetings with al Qaeda about what should be done?

   7   A   When I pay the money, the money I paid back I paid to Abu

   8   Dijana al Yemeni.  And I told him I don't have no more money.

   9   He told me, I can't help you, you have to pay all the money

  10   back, and he told me you have to talk with Abu Fadhl al Makkee

  11   about that or Abu Abdallah Bin Laden.

  12   Q   The person you spoke to, Abu Dijana, told you you had to

  13   speak about that with Abu Fadhl al Makkee or Usama Bin Laden?

  14   A   Yes.

  15   Q   And who did you speak to?

  16   A   I met first Abu Fadhl al Makkee and he told me, I can't

  17   help you.  If you pay more than, more than half, that's much

  18   better, but you pay a little and you have to do your best and

  19   this is not -- I can't control that.  And if you can pay more,

  20   that's better.  If you can't, you have to try to meet Abdallah

  21   Bin Laden.

  22   Q   What did you do?

  23   A   I tell him, could you make meeting, could you give me --

  24   ask Bin Laden, because I want to see him and make appointment

  25   with me and him.  And he say he's busy now, but I try my best.



                                                                388



   1   And later he call me and he tell me come to the big guesthouse

   2   Thursday and maybe after isha prayer you can meet him.

   3   Q   You mentioned isha prayer.  What time of day is isha

   4   prayer?

   5   A   It's the last prayer and after, half hour after the magrib

   6   prayer, or sunset prayer.

   7   Q   Did you actually meet with Bin Laden on the day?

   8   A   I went that day, and Abu Fadhl al Makkee, he says he's

   9   busy but see him tomorrow in Wadi al Aqiq.

  10   Q   Did you actually then go to the meeting the next day at

  11   the Wadi al Aqiq Company?

  12   A   Yes, I went the next day, and I wait like two hours and

  13   after that I meet with him.

  14   Q   When you met with him who was in the room?

  15   A   Abu Fadhl al Makkee, he sit, but after few minutes he went

  16   out and only me and him.

  17   Q   Can you tell the jury what happened when you met with

  18   Usama Bin Laden over the money you stole?

  19   A   He start and he told me, I don't care about the money, but

  20   I care about you because you start this from the beginning.

  21   You work hard in Afghanistan, you are one of the best people

  22   in al Qaeda group and we want to know -- we give you salary,

  23   we give you everything, when you travel we give you extra

  24   money, we pay your medical bill -- why you did that, what you

  25   need the money.  If anybody outside the group ask you to do



                                                                389



   1   that, you established group, we want to know what the reason

   2   for that.

   3            I tell him, no, the reason we talk about, we tell you

   4   before, the Egyptian people, they got a lot of money, they got

   5   more salary than other, and we told you some people, they

   6   joined the al Qaeda only a few years ago and we started the al

   7   Qaeda and why they got salary.  And we start talking like

   8   that.

   9            He said, there's no reason for you to do that.  If

  10   you need money, you should come to us, Abu Fadhl al Makkee or

  11   you should come speak with me and told me I want to buy house,

  12   I want to change my car, I want to do that, and you didn't do

  13   that, you just stole the money.  And I told him, I give Abu

  14   Dijana already some of that money, but I don't have no more

  15   money and I ask you for forgive and if you accept that, I did

  16   my best to be a good person and I love to be in al Qaeda group

  17   again and I love to continue.

  18            And he say, there's no forgive until you bring all

  19   the money back.  I cannot do that.  He say if I say okay, that

  20   means everybody else in al Qaeda, they take it as a reason I

  21   took money and he ask for forgive.  Go do your best and give

  22   all the money back, and after that everything going to be

  23   fine.  I tell him, but there's no money left, and he say, I

  24   can't, I can't forgive you until you give all the money.  And

  25   the meeting end like that.



                                                                390



   1   Q   How long was this meeting, approximately?

   2   A   Like 30 minutes or 45 minutes.

   3   Q   What did you do after that meeting?

   4   A   I don't have any hope when I left the office, and I went

   5   back and I tell my brother Azeri what going on, and I meet

   6   after that with Abu Fadhl al Makkee.

   7   Q   You mentioned Azeri, and you went to Abu Fadhl al Makkee?

   8   A   And after few days, I went back to Abu Fadhl al Makkee in

   9   his house and I told him what is going on in the meeting.  And

  10   he told me, I tell you you have to bring the money because our

  11   rule, we cannot use that because somebody going to do same

  12   thing and another bayat.  You have to bring the money back and

  13   after that everything going to be fine, and I tell him I

  14   really don't have money.

  15   Q   The bottom line, did you ever bring any money, more money

  16   back to al Qaeda?

  17   A   No.

  18   Q   What did you do?

  19   A   After that, I feel like I have to leave the group because

  20   even if I have -- I say, even if I bring money back, even if I

  21   bring money back, the relationship already started --

  22            MR. BAUGH:  Objection, your Honor.

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  Stop there.  We'll consent to

  24   strike.

  25            THE COURT:  Yes.



                                                                391



   1   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   2   Q   Don't tell us what you thought.

   3   A   Okay.

   4   Q   Just tell us what you did.

   5   A   I, after that, there is no hope and I think to leave

   6   Sudan.

   7   Q   And did you in fact leave Sudan?

   8   A   Yes.

   9   Q   And did you go to a number of other countries?

  10   A   Yes.

  11   Q   And did you talk to a number of other countries and talk

  12   about what happened in the Sudan and Bin Laden?

  13   A   Yes.

  14   Q   And without telling us the country you were in, did there

  15   come a time when you approached the United States Government?

  16   A   Yes.

  17   Q   Without telling us the country you were in, can you

  18   describe how you did that?

  19   A   I went to the American embassy in that country and I went

  20   to the visa line, and when my chance come, the person he help

  21   for you the application, he asked me, do you want visa?  I

  22   tell him, no, I don't want visa, but I have some information

  23   for your government and if your government help me, and I have

  24   information about people, they want to do something against

  25   your government.  And he told me sit in that chair until I



                                                                392



   1   come back to you.

   2            And he went inside, and 20 minutes later a lady opens

   3   the door and she point to me and tells me come inside.  And

   4   she took me inside the room and she tell me, what kind of

   5   information?  I told her I was in Afghanistan and I work with

   6   group and I know in fact those people, they try to make war

   7   against your country and they train very hard, they do their

   8   best to make war against your country.

   9            And she tell me, what kind of war?  I tell her, I

  10   don't know, maybe they try to do something inside United

  11   States and they try to fight the United States Army outside,

  12   and also they try make bomb against some embassy outside.  And

  13   she tell me, how you know that?  I tell her, because I work

  18   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

  19   Q   Can you tell us approximately the year and the month, if

  20   you can recall, that you walked in this embassy?

  21   A   That's in '96.

  22   Q   Do you recall the month or the season?

  23   A   I think during between June and -- between May and July.

  24   Q   Okay.  And after you met with this person, did you meet

  25   with other people in the embassy?



                                                                393

  11   anything in these few months?

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.

  13   A   I don't know.

  14            THE COURT:  Sustained.  Stricken.

  15   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

  16   Q   Without telling us the rest of the conversation, did you

  17   have meetings with other people after that?

  18   A   Yeah, when I finish inside, she tell me come Friday

  19   because three people, they going to come to our government and

  20   they going to meet you.

  21   Q   Did you, without telling us the conversation, did you meet

  22   with three people from the U.S. government that Friday?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   And without telling us the conversation, for how long did

  25   you meet with those three people in that country?



                                                                394



   1   A   Three weeks.

   2   Q   Without telling us what you did tell them, during those

   3   three weeks did you make a decision to intentionally not tell

   4   them anything?

   5   A   Yes.

   6   Q   Can you tell the jury what it is you decided not to share

   7   with those three people from the U.S. government?

   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.

   9   A   I don't want to tell him about --

  10            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection.

  11            May we approach on this, your Honor, a brief sidebar

  12   on this?

  13            THE COURT:  We'll take a recess.  We'll take a

  14   recess.

  15            (Jury not present)

  16            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Schmidt, you have an

  17   objection?  What is the nature of your objection?

  18            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, the government has begun to

  19   go into prior consistent or inconsistent statements with this

  20   witness.

  21            THE COURT:  Yes.

  22            MR. SCHMIDT:  Until cross-examination, I don't think

  23   it's appropriate to do that because the question is what

  24   issues am I going to raise on cross-examination, not issues

  25   that the government wishes to head off prior to my


<P>
                                                                395



   1   cross-examination.

   2            THE COURT:  Oh, the government is entitled to

   3   anticipate, and if the witness in fact made incorrect

   4   statements or withheld, deliberately withheld information, the

   5   government is entitled to establish that on direct.

   6            MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, I would then request to make sure

   7   that they don't try to bring out consistent statements that

   8   he's alleged to have made because that's not proper.

   9            THE COURT:  I take it the government is aware of

  10   that, right?

  11            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes, exactly.  That's why I told

  12   him --

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  You don't have a repeat of his earlier

  14   testimony.

  15            THE COURT:  He's not going to reprise everything that

  16   he told them.  I think the questions are what did he -- other

  17   things he decided not to tell them.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  Exactly, your Honor.

  19            THE COURT:  And that's it.

  20            MR. FITZGERALD:  That's it.

  21            THE COURT:  Does that conclude this witness's

  22   testimony?

  23            MR. FITZGERALD:  And then we'll go through his coming

  24   to America and pleading guilty.

  25            THE COURT:  Okay.  So we'll finish before noon?



                                                                396



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

   2            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, can we just have a proffer

   3   of what he didn't tell them, just so it's not problematic.

   4            MR. FITZGERALD:  He didn't tell them he stole the

   5   money.

   6            MR. RUHNKE:  Okay.

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  Answered my question.

   8            THE COURT:  Short and sweat.  We might as well

   9   resume, right?

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  11            MR. BAUGH:  Are we taking a recess or bringing the

  12   jury back?

  13            THE COURT:  Bringing the jury back.

  14            (Brief recess)

  15            THE COURT:  Can we have by Tuesday morning the

  16   redacted voir dire of the 18 who are on the panel?

  17            MR. KARAS:  Yes.

  18            THE COURT:  In terms of the 100 who were not on the

  19   panel, we'll defer that until, if ever, until there is a need

  20   for it.

  21            All right, we're all set.  We'll bring the jury in.

  22            (Jury present)

  23            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, please remember

  24   when we next adjourn to bring your binders to the jury room.

  25            The witness may resume the stand.



                                                                397



   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  May I proceed?

   2            THE COURT:  Yes.

   3   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

   4   Q   Sir, I'm going to ask you questions about the

   5   conversations you had during that three-week period.  I don't

   6   want you to tell us what you did say, I just want to focus on

   7   one question:  What was it that you deliberately decided not

   8   to tell the people who were talking to you?

   9   A   What people?

  10   Q   When you were in the country talking to the three U.S.

  11   government people that you had a meeting with and you spent

  12   approximately three weeks in that country and you were talking

  13   to them, just before the break you said that there was

  14   something you decided not to tell them.

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   Can you tell the jury what it is that you decided not to

  17   tell them?

  18   A   I don't want to tell them about I stole money from Bin

  19   Laden group.

  20   Q   And can you just briefly describe why you didn't want to

  21   tell them that?

  22   A   I just embarrass about that.

  23   Q   Did there come a time when you did tell those people that

  24   you did steal the money?

  25   A   After two days talking, yes, I tell them.



                                                                398



   1   Q   And can you tell us why you decided then to tell them

   2   about the money you stole?

   3   A   Because they keep saying we know something about you

   4   personally did it in Sudan, something, you did something in

   5   Sudan and you have to tell us because if you don't tell us,

   6   we're not going to trust you.

   7   Q   Just answer yes or no:  Did you think at the time you told

   8   them about the money that they already knew that?

   9   A   Yes.

  10   Q   Did there come a time when you left that country to go

  11   someplace else?

  12   A   Yes.

  13   Q   Just without describing the country, can you tell us

  14   generally where you went?

  15   A   Europe.

  16   Q   And did you meet with other people from the American

  17   government in Europe?

  18   A   Yes.

  19   Q   Did that eventually include people from the FBI and the

  20   Department of Justice?

  21   A   Right.

  22   Q   Did there come a time when you left Europe?

  23   A   Yes.

  24   Q   Can you tell us where you went next?

  25   A   To United States, New York.



                                                                399



   1   Q   And did you reach an agreement with the United States

   2   Government once you arrived in America?

   3   A   Yes.

   4   Q   And can you tell us what your understanding of the

   5   agreement was?

   6   A   Would you repeat?

   7   Q   Yes.  What was the agreement you reached?  What did you

   8   agree to do and what did the government agree to do?

   9   A   I agreed to plead guilty and I agreed to help the

  10   government whatever they ask me and outstanding for anything

  11   they ask me.

  12   Q   And can you just give the interpreter the Arabic word you

  13   used for outstanding?

  14   A   (Through the interpreter) That I will always be ready for

  15   the question and that I will answer them.

  16   Q   And anything else that you agreed to do?

  17   A   Also, they say we want to give you sentence up to 15

  18   years.

  19   Q   Did you actually plead guilty to a crime?

  20   A   Yes.

  21   Q   What is your understanding of the crime or crimes that you

  22   pleaded guilty to?

  23   A   Work with the people and group who want to make war

  24   against the United States.

  25   Q   And any other charge that you recall pleading guilty to?



                                                                400



   1   A   Move weapons and explosives.

   2   Q   And what is your understanding of what the biggest

   3   sentence is that you could received as result of that guilty

   4   plea?

   5   A   Up to 15 years.

   6   Q   And what is your understanding of the smallest sentence

   7   you could receive?

   8   A   It could be mid of 15 years, it could be 15, it could be 5

   9   years.  This is up to the judge.

  10   Q   Could it be as low as zero?

  11   A   It could be.

  12   Q   Now, when you first came to the United States, who were

  13   you staying with?

  14   A   With FBI.

  15   Q   Were you in FBI custody 24 hours per day?

  16   A   Yes.

  17   Q   For how long did you stay in the FBI custody 24 hours per

  18   day?

  19   A   Between 18 months and two years, I think.

  20   Q   Did there come a time when you left FBI custody?

  21   A   Yes.

  22   Q   Where did you generally go there?

  23   A   If she help me?

  24            (Through the interpreter) The witness program.

  25   Q   Is that the Witness Protection Program?



                                                                401



   1   A   Yes.

   2   Q   Without telling us where you are, are you now in the

   3   Witness Protection Program?

   4   A   Yes.

   5   Q   When you left the Sudan and approached the United States

   6   overseas, where was your family?

   7   A   In Sudan.

   8   Q   After you pleaded guilty did the government do anything

   9   for your family, your immediate family in Sudan?

  10   A   Yes.

  11   Q   What did the government do?

  12   A   Bring them here to United States.

  13   Q   Did you ever ask the government if you were eligible for a

  14   reward from the State Department for providing information

  15   about terrorism?

  16   A   They say no.

  17            MR. BAUGH:  Objection, your Honor.  That was

  18   non-responsive.

  19            THE COURT:  Yes.

  20            Restate the question.

  21   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

  22   Q   Focus on my question:  Did you ask the government whether

  23   or not you could get a reward from the State Department for

  24   providing information about terrorism?  Yes or no, did you

  25   ask?



                                                                402



   1   A   Yes.

   2   Q   And what were you told?

   3   A   They say we help you, but there is no reward.

   4   Q   Were you told why you could not get a reward?

   5   A   They say you work with a group against the government and

   6   we can't give you money.  There is no reward for somebody who

   7   work against the government.

   8   Q   And as part of your plea agreement did the government

   9   agree to give or loan you any money?

  10   A   Yes.

  11   Q   Can you tell the jury what it is that you understand you

  12   should receive?

  13   A   They told me, we give you 20,000 loan to start your life

  14   and you have to bring it back.

  15   Q   The money, what do you mean by "you have to bring it

  16   back"?

  17   A   This loan, as a loan, the loan is not gift.

  18   Q   What is your understanding of what if anything the

  19   government will do at the time -- strike that.

  20            Have you been sentenced yet by a judge?

  21   A   Not yet.

  22   Q   What is your understanding of what it is that the

  23   government may do at the time that you are sentenced by a

  24   judge?

  25   A   I remember they say they going to give the judge something



                                                                403



   1   called 5K.

   2   Q   And 5K, can you tell the jury your understanding of what a

   3   5K is?

   4   A   5K, it's about what I did for the government, what I did

   5   in the past, what I did now, and this is going to the judge.

   6   Q   And what is your understanding of what can happen as a

   7   result if the government gives a 5K to the judge?

   8   A   It could be, it could be the judge, he say, because what

   9   he did bad, but he did good, we give him a little lower than

  10   15 years.

  11   Q   Could the judge give you zero?

  12   A   Yes.

  13   Q   Is it your understanding that the 5K can help the judge if

  14   he wishes to give you a lesser sentence?

  15   A   Yes.

  16   Q   Have you been promised what your sentence will be?

  17   A   No.

  18            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, at this time, subject to

  19   the one small matter I made a reservation on, the government

  20   has no further questions.

  21            THE COURT:  Very well.  All right.

  22            Ladies and gentlemen, you just heard the direct

  23   testimony of this witness.  We're going to adjourn.  As you

  24   know, we're adjourning until Tuesday, at which time defense

  25   counsel will be given an opportunity to cross-examine the



                                                                404



   1   witness.  So please take your binders, please have a nice

   2   holiday, and please remember not to read, watch, listen or

   3   talk to anybody about anything about this case.  We'll see you

   4   on Tuesday morning.

   5            (Jury excused)

   6            THE COURT:  We've got a conference set for 2:30

   7   tomorrow.  Is that still convenient?  You want to do it

   8   earlier?

   9            MR. SCHMIDT:  2:30 is fine.

  10            THE COURT:  2:30 is fine.  Anything else on the

  11   agenda for Thursday?

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  We have to deal with the issue

  13   concerning the testimony yesterday about the explosives.

  14            THE COURT:  About?

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  The explosives.  We got the transcript

  16   today as to what the witness said and what his thought -- what

  17   his speculation was.

  18            THE COURT:  Yes.  Can we deal with that now?

  19            MR. SCHMIDT:  I guess we can.

  20            THE COURT:  We'll deal with it Thursday.  We'll deal

  21   with it Thursday.  The question of --

  22            MR. SCHMIDT:  The question where the government asked

  23   for this witness's speculation as to really where he thought

  24   the --

  25            THE COURT:  This was to Somalia?



                                                                405



   1            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, this is Yemen.

   2            THE COURT:  Yemen.

   3            MR. SCHMIDT:  I think it's 340, 341.

   4            THE COURT:  Page 341, line 13:  "Do you know in fact

   5   whether or not anything in those boxes or crates was ever used

   6   against the American military in Saudi Arabia?"

   7            MR. SCHMIDT:  Before that, your Honor, he testified

   8   that that was going to help the Yemeni people because the

   9   communists were trying to take over the government.  That's at

  10   page 17.  And then he was told that "some of the box it's

  11   explosives to Ibn al Mubarak al Sharqawi."

  12            THE COURT:  Where are you?

  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  Line 22 on page 340.

  14            THE COURT:  Page 340, line 22.

  15            MR. SCHMIDT:  Then the question was:

  16   "Q.  You mentioned that Ibn Mubarak was in Saudi Arabia?

  17   "A   Yes.

  18   "Q.  Was he a member of the al Qaeda?

  19   "A   Yes."

  20            Then they asked the question which we have the

  21   problem with.

  22            THE COURT:  But there's no answer.

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, he says:  "What was your

  24   understanding at the time --"

  25            That's on page 341, line 7.  I object.



                                                                406



   1            "-- what the weapons were to be used for?"

   2            Your Honor overruled.  He said, "What I believe at

   3   that time, they want to use it against foreign army and

   4   American army in east Saudi Arabia."

   5            There is no testimony in there that he was told that.

   6   He was never told that.  That's the operation of his mind

   7   without the base -- based on no facts to back it up.  In fact,

   8   most of this is told that he's going to Yemeni to fight the

   9   communists.  There is no basis for the witness to make that

  10   statement.  That is, of course, very prejudicial without the

  11   basis of fact.

  12            THE COURT:  So your motion is to strike lines 11 and

  13   12 on page 341?

  14            MR. SCHMIDT:  My motion is to strike those, your

  15   Honor.  And I will forward a request of a curative instruction

  16   to the Court so the jury is not under the mistaken belief that

  17   this witness had any clue that those explosives were going to

  18   be used against Americans.

  19            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, this was in the robing

  20   conference where there are certain matters that the defense

  21   did not want put before the jury.  This witness had an

  22   understanding from conversations that the explosives might be

  23   used against the troops in Saudi Arabia.  His understanding

  24   was so clear that he pled guilty to a charge for moving those

  25   explosives in the belief that that was in furtherance of the



                                                                407



   1   conspiracy against the American military.  He pled guilty

   2   before Judge Koeltl regarding that.

   3            Now, to take out any inference that al Qaeda is

   4   charged or that this case is about the Riyadh or Khobar

   5   bombings, what we sought to do was to elicit the impeachment

   6   material that the witness took actions thinking they were

   7   against the American military, and then we stipulated, as

   8   provided, that there is no belief or contention that those

   9   explosives were actually used for the purpose.

  10            I think we cut a fair balance of not misleading the

  11   jury as to what his intentions and motives were, particularly

  12   where he pled guilty, but not leading the jury to believe that

  13   anybody in this room is responsible for those acts.

  14            THE COURT:  I think this is a fair example of no good

  15   deed goes unpunished, because it seems to me that that's what

  16   happened -- that there was this conference and an agreement

  17   reached as to how the jury would be told that there is no

  18   government contention that anything in these crates was ever

  19   used against the American military, but that this is what the

  20   witness believed, believed to the point that he pled guilty to

  21   it.

  22            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, the only problem, the

  23   government says they elicited this because it's Giglio

  24   material, bad act, and they are saying, well, they're allowed

  25   to, and only allowed to bring out the bad acts before we have



                                                                408



   1   a chance.  However, under these circumstances, there's no way

   2   that we would ever on cross-examination elicit this bad act

   3   from the witness.

   4            THE COURT:  The thing we have to look at -- does

   5   somebody have it -- is the robing room conference at which

   6   this agreement was reached.  When was that?

   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  The day before yesterday.  That

   8   would be Monday.

   9            THE COURT:  That would be February 5.

  10            MR. FITZGERALD:  Yes.

  11            THE COURT:  Let's do this tomorrow.  There's no need

  12   to do all this in open court.  We'll take this up at our 2:30

  13   conference tomorrow.

  14            MR. RICCO:  Your Honor, given the briefing schedule

  15   that the Court set out this morning --

  16            THE COURT:  Yes.

  17            MR. RICCO:  -- there's no need for us to be present

  18   at that conference tomorrow on the issues that we had

  19   intended.

  20            THE COURT:  We're dealing tomorrow with discovery?

  21   What are we dealing with tomorrow, the matter that we were

  22   dealing with yesterday?

  23            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

  24            THE COURT:  And you have furnished your materials?

  25            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.



                                                                409



   1            THE COURT:  All right.

   2            MR. COHN:  That covers us as well, your Honor.  I

   3   suspect that we don't have to be here tomorrow.  Those issues

   4   were eventually --

   5            THE COURT:  My understanding of the subject is that

   6   it deals with discovery requests and ongoing CIPA matter with

   7   respect to El Hage.  Anybody aware of anything else they want

   8   to take up?

   9            MR. BAUGH:  Is that going to be open?

  10            THE COURT:  No.

  11            MR. BAUGH:  The press wanted to know about whether

  12   it's going to be an open proceeding.

  13            THE COURT:  That will be a closed proceeding.  The

  14   press has time off, also.

  15            The court security officer has requested meeting with

  16   all defense counsel tomorrow to discuss CIPA procedures.  So

  17   we can do that tomorrow at 2:30, also.  So all defense

  18   counsel, I think one representative should be adequate.

  19            MR. COHN:  Okay.

  20            MR. RUHNKE:  Your Honor, just on that issue?

  21            THE COURT:  Yes.

  22            MR. RUHNKE:  Our defense team, for what it's worth,

  23   has made other plans tomorrow.  There isn't a CIPA document, I

  24   think I can say that, that is relevant to our client, and we

  25   ask to be excused from meeting with the Court security officer



                                                                410



   1   tomorrow.

   2            THE COURT:  You would ask to be what?

   3            MR. RUHNKE:  Excused from meeting with the court

   4   security officer tomorrow on procedures that have nothing to

   5   do with us.

   6            THE COURT:  I'm told that's all right.  That's all

   7   right.

   8            MR. RUHNKE:  Thank you.

   9            THE COURT:  We're adjourned, then, for a conference

  10   with counsel, except for counsel for K.K. Mohamed, at 2:30

  11   tomorrow, and the trial will resume on Tuesday at 10 a.m.

  12            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, where will we conference?

  13            THE COURT:  I think in the robing room here.  Robing

  14   room of 318.

  15            All right.  We're adjourned.

  16            (Adjourned to 2:30 p.m. on February 8, 2001)
