<td>The government received information that Abdullah Ocalan, leader of
the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey, arrived in the country on 2nd
February, 1999 at 11:33 p.m. abroad a private jet. The request for diplomatic
clearance for the said aircraft was sought by the Embassy of Greece. The
aircraft landed without clearance, since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
had wanted to establish the status of the persons in the aircraft prior
to its arrival.&nbsp;
<p>The government also established that the names of the persons used in
the Greek Embassy's Note Verbale seeking clearance were fictitious. The
Greek Ambassador was at pains to explain why the names appearing in the
Note Verbale were different from the persons at the Embassy.&nbsp;
<p>After intervention with the Greek Ambassador, it was confirmed that
Ocalan was in the Ambassador's residence. The government immediately requested
for his expatriation form the country to which the Greek Ambassador agreed
after consultations with his minister in Athens. The Embassy undertook
the responsibility to pay their expatriation expenses. Consequently, Mr.
Ocalan departed the country yesterday, the 15th of February, 1999, at about
7:30 p.m. local time, for a destination known to the Greek authorities.&nbsp;
<p>The government has established that the Mr. Ocalan arrived in the country
from Milan, Italy. According to the Greek ambassador nationals from the
following countries accompanied Ocalan: Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom,
Belgium and Greece.&nbsp;
<p>The entry of Mr. Ocalan into the country appears to have been well known
to the Greek government. We are puzzled as to why Kenya was chosen as a
destination for Ocalan. It is possible that the Greek authorities may have
taken advantage of the strong friendly relations existing between our two
countries, which raises serious questions about their sincerity and trustworthiness.&nbsp;
<p>The greek government must be aware that Kenya was recently a target
by terrorists who bombed the United States Embassy on August 7th, 1998,
causing heavy loss of life and extensive damage to property in Nairobi.
The presence of Mr. Ocalan in the country, therefore, raises serious security
concerns. We would not have expected a friendly country like Greece to
subject Kenya to such an awkward situation giving rise to suspicion and
possible attack.&nbsp;
<p>The government is, therefore, taking up the matter with the government
of Greece with a view to ascertaining the full circumstances and reasons
leading to the illegal entry of Mr. Ocalan to Kenya.&nbsp;
<p>The Greek Ambassador H.E. George Costorias was at hand to meet the group
at the J.K.I.A. He briefly boarded the aircraft and left with passengers
without following any of the formalities. No immigration arrival cards
were filled as the passengers were simply walked through. Initially when
the government got wind of Mr. Ocalan's presence in the Ambassador's residence
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Ambassador to explain, but
he vehemently denied. However, when he was confronted yesterday with concrete
evidence, he owned up, setting into motion the process of his departure
as outlined above.&nbsp;
<p>In view of the above, it is no longer possible to trust the Ambassador
as serious doubts about his credibility have been created. Accordingly,
the government had demanded his recall with immediate effect.&nbsp;
<p>The government of Kenya wishes to emphasize that the government had
no role whatsoever to play in Mr. Ocalan's presence in Kenya.</td>
