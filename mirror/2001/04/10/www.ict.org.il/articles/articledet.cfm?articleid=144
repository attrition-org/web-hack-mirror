<p>This study analyzes the unique event in the Northern Ireland history:
the 1981 Hunger Strike. Using an international selection of articles, books,
newspapers, I address three specific questions:
<ol>
<li>
What features characterized the coverage of the hunger strike?</li>

<li>
What degree of legitimacy was accorded to the prisoner’s protest?</li>

<li>
What explanations were given for the protest, the prisoner’s electoral
success, and their willingness to die in pursuit of their demands?</li>
</ol>
For more than two decades Northern Ireland has suffered the high social
cost of a violent political conflict. Debates over the nature of this conflict
have been wide-ranging, but the dominant view, one, which is reflected
in every material, is that the conflict is ‘criminal’ rather than ‘political’
in nature. This view holds that the violence is widespread ‘terrorism,’
with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) seen as the chief protagonist. But
while this view is dominant, it is not ubiquitous. It is held neither by
those who challenge the foundations of the Northern Ireland state,[1] nor
by those communities which are tolerant if not supportive of those labeled
as ‘terrorists.’[2]
<p>Much of the debate over the conflict revolves around the issue of legitimacy,
particularly concerning the right to engage in political violence. Weber’s[3]&nbsp;
definition of the state as that entity which has a monopoly over the legitimate
use of coercive sanctions suggests that legitimacy be only accorded to
the actions of state agents. However, Weber’s definition neglects the activities
of individuals and groups who reject state authority and become actively
involved in the process of seeking alternative institutions and expressions
of legitimacy. In Northern Ireland, these activities include establishing
the right to engage in self-policing/’ popular justice’ activities, to
violently oppose agents of the state,[4] and to receive conditions and
status of imprisonment befitting adversaries of the state.[5] Other activities
include the maintenance of this legitimacy in a day-to-day context, often
in the face of opposition from the wider society.[6]
<p>The hunger strike was a legitimacy crisis for the state of Northern
Ireland. Since the mid 1970s, the British government has pursued a variety
of strategies as part of its general response to the Northern Irish conflict.
These various policies were ‘criminalization,’ ‘normalization,’ and ‘Ulsterization,’
and they shared a common goal of changing public perceptions of the nature
of the conflict. The normalization and Ulsterization policies were efforts
to normalize and localize the conflict, removing the British Army from
its role as the primary policing agency and replacing it with the indigenous
forces of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.[7] The criminalization policy
was an attempt to downplay the political dimensions of the conflict, portraying
the actions of those who challenged the Northern Irish State as ‘ordinary’
crime rather than part of a national liberation struggle. Accordingly,
the prisoner’s claims that their motivation was political rather than criminal
were a direct challenge to this policy. It undermined the entire strategy
the British Government had adopted, and it offered an alternative interpretation
of the nature of the conflict, the nature of the British presence in Northern
Ireland, and the nature of the Northern Ireland state itself.
<p>The 1981 hunger strike was also pivotal to the Northern Irish conflict
in several other respects. It ‘unintentionally mobilized’[8] in constitutional
politics those who violently challenged the foundations of the Northern
Irish state, encouraging them to pursue a dual strategy of political participation
and political violence.[9] It offered the Nationalist community a group
of ‘martyrs’ who were quickly incorporated into the popular culture. Finally,
it brought media attention to Northern Ireland as never before,[10] generating
coverage that was often very critical of the British Government’s role
in Northern Ireland.
<p>Despite the widespread publicity associated with the hunger strike,
it has not received the scholarly attention it deserves. The principal
works on the hunger strike have been descriptive rather than insightful.
<p><a NAME="definition"></a><b><font size=+1>Defining ‘Terrorism’ and ‘Political
Violence’</font></b>
<p>Situating the Northern Irish conflict within a terrorism framework has
been consequential for analysis and intellectual inquiry. The labeling
of the Northern Irish conflict in one-dimensional ‘criminal’ and ‘terrorist’
terms has restricted our ability to meaningfully grasp the significance
of events and the motives of the participants.
<p>Terrorism, like other devalued behavior such as rape, has failed to
attract researchers willing to ‘appreciate’ such behavior. My intent is
not to suggest that ‘terrorism’ should be appreciated, but to argue that
those holding positions of power often seek to label as ‘terrorism ‘the
behavior of those who challenge or oppose them, in an effort to deny the
legitimacy of their opponents.
<p>Given that writers describe political violence in a variety of ways,
each description carrying with it its own ideological baggage, it is appropriate
to clarify the meaning of certain terms in this work. Definitions are ideological,
and few more so than ones of ‘terrorism.’ The task of distinguishing between
and comprehensively defining ‘terrorism,’ ‘guerilla warfare,’ ‘political
violence,’ and other related behaviors is problematic for reasons other
than conceptual and technical difficulties.[11] Each of these descriptive
terms makes evaluative judgments about the actors’ motivations, their relationship
with the wider society, and the legitimacy of their actions.
<p>In Western society, describing an action as ‘terrorism’ invites censure
on those who committed it. The term is primarily used ‘to describe people
seen as making an unjustifiable use of violence,’[12] and this is consequential
for efforts to define terrorism. As Gibbs observed: ‘because labeling actions
as ‘terrorism’ promotes condemnation of the actors, a definition may reflect
ideological or political bias.’[13]
<p>In light of these difficulties, Walter Laqueur argued that the value-laden
nature of the term defied all efforts to generate a comprehensive and objective
definition of terrorism. He wrote that such a definition ‘does not exist
nor will it be found in the foreseeable future. However, to argue that
terrorism cannot be studied until such a definition exists is manifestly
absurd.’[14] Gibbs correctly criticized this position on the grounds that’
it is no less ‘’manifestly absurd’’ to pretend to study terrorism without
at least some definition of it. Leaving the definition implicit is the
road to obscurantism.’[15] Of course, Laqueur’s claims did not prevent
him from then proceeding to define terrorism as ‘the use of covert violence
by a group for political ends….’[16] However, definitions such as these
are hopelessly vague and of little analytical value. That the same criticism
can be made of the majority of works on terrorism is both a reflection
on the poor intellectual development of this area and an indication of
the inherent difficulties surrounding the categorization of devalued behavior.
In a recent effort to correct this situation, Gibb(1989) offered by far
the most sophisticated definition. Terrorism, he wrote:
<p>Is illegal violence or threatened violence directed against human or
non-human objects, provided that it:
<ol>
<li>
was undertaken or ordered with a view to altering or maintaining at least
one putative norm in at least one particular territorial unit or population,</li>

<li>
had secretive, furtive, and/or clandestine features that were expected
by the participants to conceal their personal identity and/or their future
location,</li>

<li>
was not undertaken or ordered to further the permanent defense of some
area,</li>

<li>
was not conventional warfare and because of their concealed personal identity,
concealment of their future location, their threats, and/or their spatial
mobility, the participants perceived themselves as less vulnerable to conventional
military action;</li>

<li>
was perceived by the participants as contributing to the normative goal
previously described by inculcating fear of violence in persons ( perhaps
an indefinite category of them ) other than the immediate target of the
actual or threatened violence and/or publicizing some cause.[17]</li>
</ol>
Despite the complexity of this definition, Gibbs’ efforts were undermined
by his earlier claim that definitions of terrorism ‘may reflect ideological
or political bias.’[18]
<p>While it is axiomatic to claim that language is value-laden, it is nonetheless
true that some terms are more heavily laden than others. Gibbs has offered
an objective definition of terrorism by clearly specifying the criteria
by which behavior is or is not to be classified as such, but the term itself
continues to invite a negative response. What Gibbs has arduously defined
is some form of goal-oriented, violent (or violence threatening), and furtive
behavior; his next task should be to find less disparaging name than terrorism
for it.
<p>However, an acknowledgment of the difficulties surrounding definitions
of terrorism is not to deny a common thread among the diverse attempts
to generate such a definition. This involves the achievement of a desired
and usually explicitly political goal through the interaction of three
social groups. The first group, the terrorists, acts in some coercive fashion
upon the second group, the victims in order to generate a specific response
from the third group, the audience. Accordingly, ‘terrorism can best be
understood as a violent communication strategy.’[19] It is from the need
for communication channels between terrorists and their audience that the
concerns about the media’s relationship with terrorism have emerged.
<p>In this study it is neither necessary nor useful to develop a definition
of terrorism, because what is of primary importance is how others use the
term, particularly given the underlying value-assumptions which characterize
the term. Accordingly, the term is used only in a context where it best
describes the stance of a particular perspective or author. An alternative
would be to follow Gibbs’ lead, specifying numerous criteria whose presence
establishes an act as ‘terrorism,’ but in my view, the connotations of
the term impede analysis more than they help it. Therefore, the term ‘political
violence’ is used to describe the actions of those organizations and individuals
that challenge the foundations of existing political structures through
violent means.
<p><a NAME="background"></a><b><font size=+1>Historical Background to the
Hunger Strike</font></b>
<p>Relations between Ireland and Britain reflect their past colonial relationship,
and this is nowhere more evident than in Northern Irish Society. Approximately
60 percent of Northern Ireland’s population of 1.5 million are Protestants.
The remaining 40 percent are Catholic. In general, Protestants, through
their allegiance to the British Crown and their support for the political
union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, are referred to as Loyalists
and Unionists. Similarly Catholics, due to their desire for a united Irish
Republic, are known as Nationalists and Republicans. This clear division
between religious groups has fostered the belief that the conflict is a
religious one. But analyses such as these are simplistic and misguided,
for they fail to account for the fact that geographical, cultural, economic,
ethnic, and political divisions between these two groups parallel the religious
division in Northern Irish society.
<p>Prior to the division of Ireland into the two states of Northern Ireland
and the Irish Free State (the latter becoming the Republic of Ireland in
1949), Unionists were concentrated in the northeastern corner of the island.
The calls for Home Rule, which emanated from the southern and nationalist
part of Ireland greatly alarmed Unionists, who wished to preserve the existing
political arrangements. The 1916 Easter rebellion in Dublin and subsequent
execution of its leaders led to the War of Independence fought between
Nationalists and the police and Army. The British Government tried to alleviate
the situation by introducing the 1920 Government of Ireland Act which made
provisions for two parliaments in Ireland: one would govern the six communities
that now constitute Northern Ireland while the other would control the
remainder of the island, 26 counties in all. But Britain’s military grasp
on Ireland was fragile and demands for Home Rule had now became demands
for independence. Under the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, Ireland would be granted
its independence, but with the important provision that the Northern Irish
parliament could opt out of the Irish Free State, which it immediately
did. On this basis, the state of Northern Ireland was formed.
<p>Two considerations, however, heavily influenced the geographical shape
Northern Ireland took. First, it had to contain a stable Unionist majority,
and second, it had to be sufficiently large to sustain itself. This meant
that those areas whose population was overwhelmingly Nationalist would
be excluded from this new state, while a certain proportion of Nationalists
would still be included within it. Thus of the six counties that eventually
comprised Northern Ireland, two had strong Unionist majorities, two had
slight Unionist majorities, and the remaining two had slight Nationalist
majorities. This guaranteed Northern Ireland a Unionist majority, but the
presence of a disenchanted Nationalist minority ensured that Northern Ireland’s
existence would be a troubled one, with political rule being achieved,
if not through coercion, then at least without a consensus.
<p>This underlying tension in Northern Irish society was reflected in recurring
violent incidents and riots between the Unionists majority and the Nationalist
minority. Between 1956 and 1962 the Irish Republican Army engaged in a
campaign directed against military installations throughout Northern Ireland.
But with little support from the nationalist community, this was a failure
and the campaign soon ground to a halt.[20]
<p>The most recent outbreak of violence, one that continues to the present
day, began in 1968. Inspired by civil rights movements throughout the world,
Catholic nationalists began a vocal civil rights campaign. Protesting against
the widespread discrimination in Northern Irish society, they sought equitable
treatment in the areas of employment, housing, and political representation.
<p>Clashes between civil right activists, the Unionists and the security
forces soon became more frequent and bloodier. Following several years
of dormancy, the IRA resurfaced as the protector of the Nationalist community
( Bishop and Mallie 1987). The violence continued to escalate and the British
Army was ordered into Northern Ireland on August 14, 1969.
<p><a NAME="internment"></a><b><font size=+1>Interment and Special Category
Status</font></b>
<p>Within a context of increasing levels of political violence, the Northern
Irish government decided to introduce internment. Through the suspension
of ‘habeas corpus,’ internment consisted of the arrest and indefinite detention
without trial of those suspected of participating in political violence.
Internment, however, was not a new idea. The Government of the Irish Republic
had introduced it in 1939 and 1957 to combat the IRA. It had also been
previously introduced in Northern Ireland in 1922 and 1957, once again
to counter threat posed by militant republicanism (Kelley 1990). However,
the introduction of internment on this occasion was to have profound and
lasting consequences for Northern Irish society.
<p>Republicans had expected the introduction of internment for some time,
for, despite the misgivings of military commanders, politicians in Northern
Ireland were openly in favor of it. In July, 1971, two Catholic men, Seamus
Cusack and Desmond Beattie, were shot dead by the British Army. These killings
led to an upsurge of violence that prompted the Northern Ireland government
to brush aside the Army’s reservations.[21] At 4 a.m. on the morning of
August 10, 1971, the security forces launched ‘Operation Demetrius,’ a
large internment operation, immediately arresting a total of 342 men.
<p>For several reasons internment was nothing short of a disaster. The
individuals for whom it was intended had been alerted to the plan by the
government informant as well as by an ominous Army raid on Republicans
on July 23. In fact, 48 hours prior to Operation Demetrius, Provisional
IRA leaders ‘traveled around the Province warning every unit of Provisionals
that internment was imminent.’[22] Moreover, the security forces relied
on inaccurate and incomplete information; in their fervor, they arrested
many people who had no contact with paramilitary organizations.
<p>Internment outraged the Nationalist community, as much for its initial
exclusive use against Nationalists as for the provocative manner in which
it was carried out. The most immediate effect of internment was a dramatic
increase in the levels of violence. The death toll grew from a total of
8 people in the 4 months prior to internment, to 17 in the 36 hours following
internment, to 41 members of the security forces and 73 civilians in the
4 months after the initial internment operation.[23]
<p>The authorities were now confronted with the twin problems of controlling
the widespread violence and of finding a way to deal with the large numbers
of internees.
<p>A total of 2158 orders of internment were signed from 1971 to 1975.[24]
Initially, some internees were kept in Crumlin Road prison in Belfast while
others were placed on the Maidstone, a British prison ship moored in Belfast
Lough ( Kelley 1990). Most, however, were eventually placed in ‘Long Kesh,’
a World War II aerodrome which was converted into an internment camp. Originally,
this camp was intended for those who were being detained without trial,
but it was soon used to house convicted prisoners as well.
<p>Internees at Long Kesh were awarded greater privileges than the convicted
prisoners. These were:
<ol>
<li>
one visit per week;</li>

<li>
one food parcel per week;</li>

<li>
unlimited in-coming and out-going mail;</li>

<li>
the right to wear personal clothing at all times;</li>

<li>
free associations with other prisoners;</li>

<li>
no statutory requirement to engage in prison work. [25]</li>
</ol>
But the disparity between the privileges given to internees and convicted
prisoners revealed an important anomaly. Individuals interned on the basis
of their supposed involvement in political violence were receiving privileges
that were denied to individuals convicted of the same crimes. To protest
this situation two convicted Republican prisoners, Billy McKee of the Provisional
Army and Peter Monaghan of the Official IRA in Crumlin Road Prison began
a hunger strike in May 1972. Other Republican prisoners quickly joined
them in their protest, and Loyalist prisoners also supported their demands
through a work strike.
<p>Simultaneously, the British government was in the process of trying
to negotiate a cease-fire with the leadership of the Provisional IRA. To
appease the IRA leadership and to maintain the cease-fire negotiations
that would certainly have collapsed in the face of a hunger striker’s death,
the British government agreed to the prisoners’ demands, and in 1972 they
granted certain convicted prisoners special category status. From June
22, 1972, special category prisoners were granted the privileges previously
available only to internees.[26]
<p>Factors other than the cease-fire negotiations also had a bearing on
the decision to introduce this measure. By introducing internment, the
British Government had implicitly acknowledged the ‘special’ nature of
the conflict. Furthermore, by allowing the inmates a great deal of autonomy,
the compound system which operated under the special category system required
fewer resources (in terms of prison buildings and manpower) than conventional
prison regimes, a welcome feature given the authorities’ pressing difficulties
of controlling prisons overcrowded with militant inmates.
<p>According to Crawford:
<blockquote>The decision to introduce special category status was made
reluctantly, as a strategic response to the position faced. The British
Government did not feel they had conceded in principle, rather that they
were dealing with temporary crisis in special circumstances, hence creating
the conditions necessary for humane containment as a prison policy. For
the British Government the political gamble with the Provisional IRA, their
agreeing to a cease-fire in return for Special Category Status must have
appeared a seductive solution to almost insurmountable and escalating problems.[27]</blockquote>

<p><br>However, special category status was to create more problems for
the British Government than it would solve, by lending legitimacy to groups
whose members received it, and with its removal leading to the 1980 and
1981 hunger strikes. The difficulties that arose from this status led William
Whitelaw, then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and responsible
for its creation, introduction, and implementation, later to regret his
actions. He admitted that he was ‘utterly, wholly and entirely wrong in
the creation of special category status.’[28]
<p>To receive this status prisoners had to fulfill two conditions. First,
they had to apply and be accepted into one of the Long Kesh compounds assigned
to an controlled by a paramilitary organization such as the Provisional
IRA, and second, their offense had to be politically motivated. While the
criteria for acceptance into a compound varied among paramilitary organizations,
applicants were generally accepted as special category prisoners if their
‘actions were directed against the particular paramilitary organization’s
enemy…without being motivated by self-gain or self-interest.’[29]
<p>While there were exceptions to this (such as paramilitary organizations
accepting individuals whom they thought were innocent), this procedure
ensured that the compounds maintained a strong paramilitary character.
<p>The prison life of special category prisoners was significantly different
from that of ordinary status prisoners within Long Kesh. According to Beresford
:
<blockquote>The inmates-whether Republican or Loyalist- lived in dormitories
in Nissen huts segregated according to paramilitary allegiance. They organized
and disciplined themselves with military-style command structures, drilled-with
dummy guns made with woodworking equipment supplied by the prison-and held
lectures on revolutionary politics and guerilla warfare.[30]</blockquote>

<p><br>Such a system gave a great deal of power to the paramilitary organizations
in the compounds, not just in facilitating their organizational demands
but, more importantly, in according them a degree of legitimacy. As the
British government realized that the conflict could continue indefinitely,
the political costs of giving special category to those who challenged
the foundations of the state increased. In an effort to counter this, the
authorities reversed their position on special category status. In 1975,
the Gardiner committee published its influential report, recommending the
abolition of special category status:
<blockquote>Although recognizing the pressures on those responsible at
the time, we have come to the conclusion that the introduction of special
category status was a serious mistake; we even have some doubts as to whether
its introduction administratively by a surprisingly liberal interpretation
of Prison Rules was legal. It should be made absolutely clear that special
category prisoners can expect no amnesty and will have to serve their sentence.
We can see no justification for granting privileges to a large number of
criminals convicted of serious crimes, in many cases murder, merely because
they claim political motivation. It supports their own view, which society
must reject, that their political motivation in some way justifies their
crimes. Finally, it is unfair to ordinary criminals, often guilty of far
less serious crimes, who are subject to normal prison discipline.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Despite the difficulties involved, we recommend that the first
practicable opportunity should be taken to end the special category. The
first opportunity should be to stop admitting new prisoners to special
category.[31]</blockquote>

<p><br>Drawing heavily upon the arguments in the Gardiner report, the British
government implemented the ‘criminalization’ policy. Accordingly, the last
internees were released in December 1975, and admission to special category
status was immediately restricted, leaving the authorities to pursue what
they hoped to be a less costly strategy for controlling political violence.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="criminalization"></a><b><font size=+1>The Criminalization Policy</font></b>
<p>The criminalization policy meant that paramilitary prisoners convicted
of political violence related offenses committed after March 1, 1976 would
be treated as ordinary criminals rather than being given special status.
(Beresford 1987, p.24). Furthermore, prisoners would no longer be housed
in the Long Kesh compounds. Instead they would be placed in a new prison,
her Majesty’s prison, the MAZE, also known as the ‘H-Blocks’ due to the
distinctive shape of the structures. But criminalization was not limited
to a change in prison procedures. With the complementary policies of Ulsterization
and normalization, it was an effort to recast the conflict in criminal
rather than political terms and to deny the political dimensions to the
conflict. Kevin Kelley wrote that:
<blockquote>Britain would now define the situation as in the province as
a problem of law and order or as an outbreak of terrorism, gangsterism,
and wanton criminality that could only be contained by locking up all suspected
perpetrators. The criminalization approach meant that the fighting in the
North of Ireland would now be characterized, for public consumption, as
senseless, Mafia-type violence and not a war of national liberation. Britain
would now argue that a responsible government did not negotiate with gangsters
or look for political solutions to a crime wave. Instead, such a government
‘got tough’ and took whatever steps might be necessary to defend democracy
and protect the public.[32]</blockquote>
The criminalization policy was premised on the assumption that the violence
in Northern- Ireland was the work of ‘criminally’ motivated individuals
who lacked community support. However, this assumption was not supported
by the findings of the ‘Glover Report,’ a confidential British Army report
assessing the strength of the IRA. Contradicting the basic premises of
the criminalization policy, the report noted that:
<blockquote>‘Our evidence of the caliber of rank and file terrorists does
not support the view that they are mindless hooligans drawn from the unemployed
and the employable…The Provisional IRA will probably continue to recruit
the men if needs. They will still be able to attract enough people with
leadership talent, good education and manual skills to continue to enhance
their all round professionalism. The movement will retain popular support
sufficient to maintain secure bases in the traditional republican areas.[33]</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="protests"></a><b><font size=+1>Prison Protests</font></b>
<p>Within the Maze prison, the inmates protested vehemently against their
change in status. Once again, this was hardly surprising to the prison
administration that had long recognized the ‘special’ nature of these prisoners.
The Royal Inspector of Prisons observed of paramilitary prisoners that:
<blockquote>They were quite unlike the population of any prison in England
or Wales in their dangerousness, their allegiance to a paramilitary organization,
their cohesiveness, their common determination to escape and their resistance
to the efforts of the prison authorities to treat them as ordinary criminals.[34]</blockquote>
In response to the criminalization policy, prisoners in the Maze engaged
in various protests between 1976 and 1981. These protests included a ‘blanket
protest’-where inmates refused to wear prison uniforms, choosing instead
to drape themselves in their blankets- and the ‘dirty protest’-where prisoners
smeared their excreta on their cell walls.( Coogan 1980). The violence
that characterized relations within the prison led paramilitary organizations
to initiate a new policy of killing prison officers, of whom 18 were killed
between 1976 and 1980.[35]
<p>In 1980, frustrated by their lack of success against the criminalization
policy and feeling unable to continue the blanket and dirty protests indefinitely,
a group of Republican prisoners went on hunger strike. They reasoned that
a hunger strike had secured their objectives in 1972 and that the tactic
could be successful once more. Seven Republican prisoners began this strike,
first refusing food on October 27, 1980. The prisoners demanded political
prisoner status, as well as other privileges that had been available prior
to the advent of the criminalization policy. They also demanded the return
of all remission (the amount of time that is normally deducted from the
sentences of conforming prisoners) they had lost through their participation
in the prison protests.
<p>Paramilitary representatives within the prison conducted negotiations
with the prison administration and the British Government. The strike continued
for 53 days when, as one of the hunger strikers was close to death, the
prisoners agreed to a settlement allegedly offered by the British government.
They ended their strike on December 18, 1980.
<p>But few changes came to the Maze prison. In fact, the British government,
for its part, denied that any significant concessions to the prisoners
had been made. The Republican prisoners claimed that the British government
was reneging on its promises, and they announced that a second hunger strike
would begin on March 1, 1981, the fifth anniversary of the introduction
of internment.
<p>The only possible way of getting enough people aroused to force a change
of policy was, the prisoners had suggested, by means of a hunger strike.
A hunger strike was a high-risk venture, in which men were likely to die
without any guarantee of success and if it was to be understood by supporters
everything else would have to be seen to be tried first.

<P><p><a NAME="strikes"></a><b><font size=+1>Hunger Strikes and the Cult of
Self-Sacrifice</font></b>
<p>Hunger striking as means of obtaining social or economic redress or
as a method of political confrontation has a plotted, yet discernible,
history in Ireland. While the phenomenon is not peculiar to Irish politics,
the country did witness one of the largest hunger strike protests of the
20<sup>th</sup> century. In October 1923, more than 8000 political prisoners,
opposed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, went on hunger strike. Two prisoners
died before the protest was called to an end.
<p>Although it can be demonstrated that the phenomenon of hunger striking
is widely used as a means of political protest, particularly so with the
last twenty-five years, it is equally valid to suggest that the hunger
strike is an integral part of Irish history and mythology. Thus for the
Irish, especially the northern Catholic republicans, the hunger strike,
linked as it is to religio-political martyrdom and the pantheon of Irish
heroes, is another means, possibly a weapon of last resort, of those nurturing
a sense of oppression and frustrated in their attempts to resist.
<p>Hunger striking as a method of protests in Ireland can be traced to
the island’s pre-Christian era when there was a strong tradition of oral
legal codes. These codes were known as the Brehon laws (derived from the
Gaelic brithem meaning’ judge’).
<p>For the people of ancient Ireland, self-help was the only means to enforce
a claim or right a wrong within the context of the Brehon laws. A frequent
method of redress was for the aggrieved party to both of the cult of self-sacrifice
and the arsenal of militant republicanism.
<p>The hunger strikes were directed against both the British government
(1913-22) and the Irish Free State authorities (1923). Many of these hunger
strikes were protests against prison conditions and the treatment of the
prisoners. Other protests were more politically organized and centered
on demands for political status or were means of dissent against perceived
unjust imprisonment. In general the protests lasted for a few days but
many, particularly the politically motivated, lasted for much longer. Some
went on for seventy-six days, and while many prisoners negotiated settlements
with the authorities or were unconditionally released, others, more determined,
were forcibly fed. Seven prisoners died as a result of hunger strikes during
this period.[36]
<p>It was against the setting of the now immortal and near-mythical 1916
Rising that the hunger strike became a weapon of extraordinary potency
in Ireland. It was to become linked to militant republicanism along with
Arthur Griffith’s Sinn Fein party, a movement opposed to the use of physical
force prior to 1916, which was deliberately and wrongfully blamed by the
British for what was officially called ‘the Sinn Fein rebellion.’
<p>In May 1916, sixty-five Irishmen, including de Valera, who had been
convicted as rebels, were imprisoned in Dartmoor. For disobeying prison
rules the Irish Prisoners were given extra punishment. De Valera went on
hunger strike against this punishment, ending it when the punishment was
withdrawn.
<p>Despite his participation in the hunger strike, de Valera was uncertain
of its propaganda value against the on-going drama provided by the First
World War. In a letter to fellow prisoners, de Valera, writing from his
Dartmoor cell early in 1917, said:
<blockquote>You may be tempted to hunger strike. As a body do not attempt
it whilst the war lasts unless you were assured from the outside that the
death of two or three of you would help the cause. As soldiers I know you
would not shrink from the sacrifice, but remember how precious a human
life is.[37]</blockquote>
Before the year was through, and after the release of Irish rebels from
British jails, the propaganda value of death by hunger strike became very
clear to the Republican movement. This means of protest and confrontation
had proved to be an efficient political weapon. Irish deaths by hunger
strike transfigured not only the perceived sacrificial victims but, in
the eyes of many ordinary people, the cause for which they died.
<p>In the case of the 1981 Hunger Strike, the prison conditions could have
operated as a safety valve. A sophisticated British government could have
defused the situation quite easily and avoided a confrontation between
itself as unyielding colonial power and a group of defenseless political
prisoners, which is how it largely came to be seen internationally. The
first hunger strike having ended, they would not have been acting under
duress if they had allowed for some new arrangements on the specifics of
prison conditions. But as the prisoners pressed for a second hunger strike
they knew that this time not only would some of them have to die but also
that they were engaging in a fight with the British government. It went
beyond the issue of prison conditions; they were pitching themselves, with
the only weapons at their command, against the imperial power. As they
faced the prospect of death they felt that the spectacle of their deaths
in prison was going to be politically productive for the republican cause
to which they were committed.
<p>Hunger strike is unlike any other form of struggle. An IRA volunteer
does not go out to get killed, if he gets killed it is because he makes
a mistake or some other circumstances arises. But a hunger striker embarks
on a process, which from day one is designed to end in his death. However,
when people contemplate their own deaths there can be no guarantee that
they will go through with it to the end. It takes a very particular kind
of person to go all the way, to resist the voices in his own head, the
concern of friends and family, not to mention the pressures of the authorities.
It is extremely difficult to know, until one is staring death right in
the face, whether one is that particular kind of person.[38]
<p>For Sands and for those who would come later, the strike would not really
be about the five demands, political status, or the legitimacy of the movement
and the armed struggle; it was to pit the will of the just against the
power of empire. For the republican to win the British would have only
to take his life, would have only to refuse to act and thus show their
shame. And he was sure that Britain would act to character, hold firm,
and so lose a moral struggle. This was to the strikers a great moral struggle
between Irish justice and British oppression that would be so recognized
only when life was given and taken. The criminals would be revealed not
by a declaration by Thatcher, not by the courts or judges, but by a trial
of spirit within the H-block cells by men alone with their faith. Hughes
and the others might not recognize the inevitable, but from the first Sands
did.
<p>The strikers were seen by many as Catholic martyrs as well as nationalist
ones. The nation’s history of denial and suffering because they were Catholic
and Irish was recalled and refashioned. Irish nationals and Catholics perceived
the strike as a traditional response to power displayed and deployed.
<p>The cult of self-sacrifice manifested itself in many emerging nations
throughout the 17<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries.
A feature of this manifestation was the legacy of ‘invulnerability’ associated
with the cult; in many societies small ill-equipped groups or even masses,
of people challenged overwhelming odds and firepower in the pursuit of
independence and nationhood. In Europe, the cult’s development was multi-dimensional.
<p><a NAME="protest_generation"></a><b><font size=+1>A Protest Generation</font></b>
<p>‘Baader-Meinhof’- the names that in the seventies inspired panic and
passionately divided the German Left (part of which was in the government),
that trigger memories of student and youth rebellion against establishment
paranoia and repression--are still being evoked today, and for dubious
reasons. The principals of the original Baader-Meinhof group have long
since died or distanced themselves. The successor RAF (Rote Armee Fraktion-
Red Army Faction) groups of the eighties had as little in common with Baader-Meinhof
and company as do copycat murderers with a notorious crime de passion.
They share neither their complex motives / hesitations nor their extraordinary
impact on their contemporaries.
<p>The only things they seem to have in common with the Baader-Meinhof
principals in their hour of defeat are the curious jailhouse strikes and
protests.
<p>From 17 January to 12 February 1973, forty RAF prisoners went on a hunger
strike to compel the authorities to ‘lift the prison isolation.’ Seven
of their attorneys, moreover, for four days did their hungering demonstratively
before the Federal High Court building in Karlsruhe. Most of the following
May and June, eighty prisoners embarked on a second hunger strike, insisting
on treatment equal to that of other inmates (but not on integration with
them) and on free information. A court ordered that the solitary confinement
of two RAF members be ended. In September 1974, forty RAF prisoners began
another hunger strike, the longest yet and one enjoying widespread public
sympathy in spite of new, unflattering revelations about RAF activities.
At the end of October 1974, members of a Committee Against Torture of Political
Prisoners, including two prominent future terrorists, occupied the Amnesty
International center in Germany in order to compel its support, although
there was no evidence of torture whatsoever. After fifty-four days of hunger
strike, though sometimes force-fed, Holger Meins died; but the strike continued.
From 17 December on, the strikers’ demands changed to consolidation in
one prison as well as an end to isolation. On 5 February 1975 the hunger
strike ended with minor concessions.
<p>But of course there were also further hunger strikes: a seventh one
began in April 1979, involving seventy inmates, and once again demanding
consolidation. An eighth hunger strike begun in February 19 involved 120
prisoners, who demanded not only better conditions in jail but also ‘arming
the resistance, organizing illegality, and supporting the armed resistance
throughout Western Europe.’ As an expression of their sentiment at this
time, the strike was really not a serious bargaining instrument but a plaintive
cry of existential frustration at a world that refused to behave their
way. The whole decade had begun with high hopes and great promise for them
but had turned into a scene as depressing as the inside of a prison cell.
<p>On 16 April 1981, Sigur Debus died after being on hunger strike for
70 days, thus providing the ‘hard-left’ with another martyr. A flurry of
small bomb attacks followed, responsibility being claimed mainly by the
Revolutionar Zellen ( RZ -&nbsp; Revolutionary Cells ), a ‘second generation’
RAF organization with a maximum of 50 activists.[39] The ‘martyr Debus’
was unusual, as he was really only a small-time, almost free-lance terrorist
who had concentrated on bank robberies and small explosions. He was not
a member of neither the RAF, the RZ, or the other formerly powerful left-wing
terrorist group, the Bewegung 2 Juni (Second of June Movement), which operated
in West Berlin, but had also lost most of its leadership and its momentum.
<p>Some years later, equipped with large posters supporting the hunger
strike of thirty-two imprisoned RAF terrorists and evidently with forged
keys to the advertisements display frames of the municipal bus company,
an unknown team blanketed Hamburg-Uhlenhorst with its poster campaign one
March night in 1989. The posters quoted Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl
to the effect that ‘this state will not give in to the terrorists in custody
as long as I am here,’ and added in red, ‘then he’s got to go.’ Other posters
in metropolitan areas and ample press coverage dramatized the protest of
the prisoners against their alleged ‘torture by isolation’ since early
February. The press insisted that, in fact, prisoners had been allowed
visitors, correspondence, and daily contacts with other imprisoned terrorists.[40]
There could be little doubt that the RAF had once more captured the attention
of the nation, even from jail. It had done so without violence to persons
so far, even though there were acts of vandalism-for example, at a department
store, a car dealership, and CDU headquarters in Hamburg. Conservative
critics reminded the public of the long series of hunger strikes and of
the prominent RAF prisoners’suicide of 1977 at Stammheim prison, Stuttgart,
following the abortive hijacking of a Lufthansa jet to Mogadishu, Somalia,
that was intended to spring them from prison. When the plane was stormed
by a special counterterrorism squad flown in from Bonn, RAF leaders- Ulrike
Meinhof had hanged herself earlier-Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and
Jan-Carl Raspe killed themselves at Stammheim, while the most prominent
RAF kidnap victim, Hanns Martin Schleyer, was murdered. Among the hunger
strikers of 1989, there were four who were involved in Schleyer’s murder,
some of whom once before, in December 1984, started a hunger strike demanding
to be granted the status of political prisoners. Most of them refused to
be in the company of the common criminals sentenced under the same statutes
against homicide, bodily harm, kidnapping, and bank robbery. Although the
hunger strike was soon called off, there was no indication that the ‘hard
core’-about fifteen persons--of the RAF had given up the armed struggle.
Nevertheless, there is considerable doubt about the cohesion and continuity
of the organization that has suffered many defections. By now it is said
to be in its fifth or sixth ‘generation’ of terrorists.[41] The fact that
most West German terrorists are or have been in prison puts their conduct
there in the limelight. But it is also interesting to follow their continuing
effort to maintain fighting morale among the imprisoned and those outside
and to retain public attention for their cause by a series of hunger strikes.
Their strikes have revived German prison reform movements and strengthened
prison support groups, which, in some cases, even supplied future RAF recruits.
(A second generation of RAF recruits included a Hamburg group called February
Four).
<p>The RZ had at first been preoccupied with an elaborate analysis of the
present and future political situation and the place of left-wing terrorism
in it. They made a point of not supporting RAF activities, including the
hunger strike in the winter of 1984-85. Once the strike was abandoned,
however, and in spite of their shrinking membership,[42] they launched
‘punitive attacks’ on corporations that had allegedly fought against striking
British miners. At the end of April 1985 bombs were set at the Deutsche
Bank in Dusseldorf and at a Cologne chemical concern. A month later a NATO
pipeline near Frankfurt was bombed.
<p>In spring of 1986, Middle eastern terrorism overshadowed RAF activities,
in West Berlin, the German-Arab Friendship Association building was bombed-seven
injured--and another bomb was detonated at the Le Belle discotheque, killing
three and wounding two hundred. Both terrorist acts were carried out with
Syrian assistance, and the perpetrators have since been tried in German
courts.
<p>Eva Juhnke who was a German guerrilla fighter from the ARGK, the armed
wing of the PKK ( Kurdistan Workers Party ) was captured during a military
operation by KDP forces in South Kurdistan in October 1997. After her deportation
to Turkey, she was sentenced to 15 years in prison for ‘membership in the
PKK.’ Eva Juhnke went on hunger strike on November 1999, in Sivas Prison.
Her action was protest against her prison conditions and a demand to be
returned to Batman Prison where she was previously held. 120 other women
prisoners in Sivas have launched a hunger strike in solidarity with Eva.
<p>Turkey’s prison conditions have long been subject to international criticism.
In 1996, 12 political prisoners died in a hunger strike demanding more
humane conditions. Political prisoners are repeatedly attacked inside Turkish
prisons. In 1996, 10 Kurdish prisoners in Diyarbakir were beaten to death
by prison guards and soldiers.
<p>Eva Juhnke ‘action has put the spotlight back on Turkey. Human rights
are still being violated and prison conditions, especially with respect
to the Kurdish question, remain a major problem. Turkey is still maintaining
its policy of denial. But the PKK has increased its efforts to seek a solution.
After ending the armed struggle, the PKK sent two peace delegations to
seek peace and democratic solutions. The first was an 8-member guerilla
group from the mountains of Kurdistan, and the second was an 8-member group
from Europe. The way these groups were treated is evidence that Turkey
is still treating the Kurdish question as it always has done. The members
of both groups were arrested as soon as they entered Turkey. All are now
facing serious criminal charges. Further evidence was this of Turkey’s
refusal to change anything.
<p>Basque political prisoners in France, often go on hunger strikes to
protest against being held in isolation and denied access to education,
prison’s library and other facilities, and to demand to be recognized as
political prisoners and regrouped in prisons in the Basque Country. On
October 2, 1996, twenty-five Basque political prisoners joined the indefinite
hunger strike started by the members of their collective on September 9.
The collective of Basque political prisoners issued a communiqu&eacute;
explaining the reasons that forced them to go and start an indefinite hunger
strike. They demanded their immediate transfer to jails in their country.
The Basque political prisoners in France are held in prisons mainly in
Paris, far away from their homes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="1981"></a><b><font size=+1>The 1981 Hunger Strike</font></b>
<p>This Irish hunger strike began with Bobby Sands, who had been the chief
negotiator between the first hunger strikers and prison officials, being
the first prisoner to refuse food. The demands he sought were:
<ol>
<li>
To be exempt from wearing prison clothes.</li>

<li>
To be exempt from prison work.</li>

<li>
To have freedom of association with fellow political prisoners.</li>

<li>
The right to organize educational and recreational facilities, to have
one weekly visit, to receive and send out one letter per week and to receive
one parcel per week.</li>

<li>
Entitlement to full remission of sentence.[43]</li>
</ol>
Initially, the hunger strike was a low-key affair, and perhaps it would
have remained so except for the death of Frank Maguire, the incumbent Member
of Parliament for Northern Ireland constituency of Fermanagh-South Tyrone.
Listing his occupation as ‘political prisoner’ and representing the ‘anti
H-block/Armagh Committee’ticket, Sands was nominated for the election and
went on to win the seat. In a marginally Nationalist constituency, Sands
beat his Unionist opponent Harry West, getting 30,492 votes against West’s
total of 29,046. This victory brought the hunger strike to the world’s
attention as the media converged on Northern Ireland. However, it was not
the only election during the hunger strike period. In the Fermanagh/South
Tyrone by election held following Sand’s death, his former election agent,
Owen Carron, won the seat. In addition to this, the Republic of Ireland
held a general election on June 11th, and two Republican inmates in the
Maze Prison, one of whom was a hunger striker, won seats in the Dail, the
Irish Parliament.
<p>Despite the enormous amounts of media coverage the hunger strikers received
due to their electoral success, the British government was determined not
to give in. The European Court of Human Rights and the Irish Commission
for Justice and Peace tried to mediate between the hunger strikers and
the authorities, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Bobby Sands was the
first hunger striker to die after 66 days without nourishment. Others followed
him, until ten hunger strikers had died in all. Relatives of the remaining
hunger strikers became increasingly opposed to the Protest. In the face
of an intransigent British government, these relatives feared that their
sons or brothers would die for nothing. The relatives of several hunger
strikers intervened once the hunger strikers lost their consciousness,
asking medical personnel to give them nourishment and thereby ending their
fasts. Realizing the futility of their position, the remaining hunger strikers
abandoned their protest on October 3, 1981.
<p>The ten prisoners who died were not the only casualties of the hunger
strike. Many more people, both civilians and members of the security forces,
were killed or injured during riots and demonstrations during this period.
Even at this high price, the inmates never received ‘political prisoner
status.’ They were, however, granted several concessions, including the
right to wear their own clothes and the return of half of the remission
they had lost.
<p>The 1981 hunger strike was a legitimacy crisis for the Northern Irish
State. Convicted prisoners who violently challenged the foundations of
the state forcefully claimed that their motivations were political and
not criminal. That they gave their lives in support of this claim highlighted
the weak foundation on which the criminalization policy was based. As well
as undermining the criminalization policy, the hunger strike exposed the
inconsistencies of the British government’s approach to the Northern Irish
conflict. The British government had enacted ‘special’ legislation, ‘special’
courts, and a variety of other procedures specifically for dealing with
the conflict; furthermore, the prison population in Northern Ireland had
increased from just over 600 in 1967 to almost 3,000 in 1978. Nevertheless,
the British Government consistently maintained that individuals convicted
of political violence offenses were ‘ordinary’ criminals and should be
treated as such.
<p>No republican will ever attach the slightest shadow of blame to those
hunger strikers who individually ended their fasts. What the ten who died
had done was so extraordinary that one almost needs another language in
order to convey it in all its awful reality. Catholic clergy intervened
with the relatives of hunger strikers to encourage them to bring about
an end to the fasts by requesting medical help. But even without their
intervention it was inevitable that some hunger strikers would eventually
pull back in the face of death. There is no regret attached to those who
came off their hunger strikes; the regret is reserved for those who died.
The real anger is reserved for the government that could quite easily have
reached an honorable compromise in the face of the ultimate in selfless
dedication to a cause.
<p>Following the end of the hunger strike adjustment in the prison regime
along the lines of the five demands began to be implemented. In an unprecedented
way the prisoners had insisted on being recognized as prisoners in a war
of national liberation, and their identity as such had been accepted throughout
the world. Britain had been seen internationally as an intransigent force
clinging to its last remnant of colonial control. The political and moral
standing of Irish republicanism had never been higher.
<p>As the hunger strikers had died and as the H-block/Armagh campaign had
its impact, a process of republicanism took place and at the end of all
the most lasting effect of the campaign within the 6 counties was its educational
value. Republicans who had done their time in prison and had subsequently
dropped out of the movement--people with valuable experience and maturity-recognized
that the hunger strikers were undergoing something far harder and harsher
than anything they had had to suffer, and they came back to the movement.
The hunger strike did away with spectator politics. When the only form
of struggle being waged was armed struggle it only needed a small number
of people to engage in it. But with the hunger strike people, rather than
just looking on at one aspect of struggle, had an active role to play,
which could be as limited or as important as bill-posting, writing letters,
or taking part in numerous forms of protest.
<p>The IRA eased back on operations during the hunger strike. But by the
time a number of hunger strikers had died there was a considerable popular
demand for the IRA to take punitive action. Toleration of the IRA increased
very significantly, as did identification with it, and this had some strange
consequences. There were occasions when IRA volunteers came out on the
Falls to engage in armed action, only to have to withdraw because people
were crowding around, applauding and patting them on the back.
<p>The hunger strike and the electoral success associated with it changed
the course of the relationship between the republican movement and the
British strategy and set in train a process which continued through to
the Hillsborough treaty. The perceived threat posed by republicanism since
the hunger strike had led to the new, open relationship between Dublin
and London, whereby the two governments are now explicitly engaged in collaboration
on a joint policy, the overriding aim of which is to deal with the republican
threat.
<p>In 1976 the British government tried to criminalise the republican prisoners.
In 1981 the republican prisoners criminalised the British government.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="activities"></a><b><font size=+1>External Activities</font></b>
<p>The effects of the movement outside the prison were more complex. The
hunger strike came in the course of a long-term run down of IRA activity,
which continued after it ended.
<p>Initially there was an escalation of violence generally. Leaving aside
the ten dead hunger strikers the year’s violent death list reached 101
and the figures of those injured touched 1442. Shooting and bombing incidents
amounted to 815 and 298 respectively. These figures are down on most previous
years and were continue to fall as the IRA’s strategy changed from all
out war to what Gerry Adams was to describe as ‘armed propaganda.’ However,
the revenge killing of hardline Official Unionist MP Rev.Robert Bradford
followed the hunger strike. He had made the mistake of saying he prayed
for an epidemic in the H-blocks, and a resumption of the bombing campaign
in Britain, which was originally intended as a means of pressure had the
hunger strike continued through the autumn.
<p>The first ‘Republican News’ after Adams visit to the prisoners did in
fact carry a statement from the IRA saying that it would like to see the
hunger strike concluded in a principled way. It also said that it was up
to the hunger strikers whether they continued or not but adding that the
prisoners ‘do not have the basis for a permanent settlement and obviously
we symphathise.’
<p>The IRA went on to say that it had come under pressure from members
and supporters ‘who believe that the IRA should pay the British government
in kind for the deaths of comrades and for the deaths on the streets. That
the IRA will do that goes without saying.’[44] The promised action came
quickly and appears to have been largely the work of a new active service
unit including Paul Kavanagh, Tommy Quigley, and British police believed,
Eibhlin Glenholmes. At least some of its members had been in place since
1979 and there were supply lines stretching through the Low Countries,
where future Brighton Bomber Pat Magee had been living, to the US as well
as to Ireland and a large explosives and arms dump in Oxfordshire. In October
a bomb outside Chelsea Barracks killed two civilians, a week later retired
Royal Marines Commander Lt.Gen.Stuart Pringle was killed by a bomb attached
to his car. On the 26<sup>th</sup> a sophisticated device in the Oxford
Street Wimpey bar killed bomb disposal expert Kenneth Howarth as he attempted
to disarm it. A further bomb followed in Oxford Street and by the beginning
of November the IRA claimed in an interview that they would disrupt central
London every day from then till Christmas. However, this seems to have
been a deliberate blind for the IRA’s intention to concentrate on more
prestigious targets. In November three major operations failed to find
their intended targets, one the home of the Attorney-General, Sir Michael
Havers, the second inside Woolwich Arsenal where it was set off by a dog
and the third at Greenwich Gasometer.
<p>Attacks on Britain continued sporadically with an explosion that killed
eleven soldiers and some horses in Hyde Park in July 1982, a spate of London
City center bombings in 1983, which culminated in the unauthorized bombing
of Harrod’s in Knightsbridge which killed two policeman and three civilians.
The peak of IRA operations came in October 1984 when they blew up the Grand
Hotel in Brighton where the Conservative leadership was staying during
their party conference.
<p>There was indeed evidence that the republicans planned to build on their
ten martyrs. The continual rioting after Sand’s death, which had merely
tapered off in the early autumn, had produced still another nationalist
grievance: the plastic bullet. In 1973 the plastic bullet had replaced
the rubber as a means of riot control. Supposedly painful but harmless,
an improvement over rubber, the four-inch by one-half-inch plastic projectile,
shot from a distance at 160 miles per hour, was meant to bound about in
riotous assembly. Shot directly at a target from close up, it could be
and was deadly. The nationalists were convinced that the bullets were used
only against the Irish, the nationalists in particular, and used often
wantonly to maim.
<p>Thatcher had featured in ‘Wanted for Murder’ posters in 1981. However
Sinn Fein’s Danny Morrison says the attack was intended not just to kill
her in revenge for her role in the death of the hunger strikers, but also
to wipe out a generation of Tory leadership and force a political crisis
in Britain. Thatcher narrowly escaped but five Conservatives were killed
in the blast. ‘Today we were unlucky,’ the IRA said in its statement claiming
responsibility for the bombing, ‘but remember, we have only to be lucky
once. You (Mrs. Thatcher) will have to be lucky always.’[45] The closest
parallel for a fully successful detonation was the destruction of the King
David Hotel in Jerusalem by Irgun, which started the process leading to
the end of the British Occupation of Palestine. As it was, the bomb pushed
Ireland up the British political agenda and made Thatcher more willing
to pay the price of the Anglo-Irish Agreement for Irish government and
SDLP support in stabilizing the province and isolating the IRA.
<p>Armed struggle would become armed propaganda, violence itself, when
possible, a backdrop to the manner in which it was represented. ‘The tactic
of armed struggle is of primary importance’ wrote an increasingly visible
Gerry Adams, ‘because it provides a vital cutting edge. Without it the
issue of Ireland would not even be an issue.’[46]
<p>Although the death fast had not accomplished all its objectives, it
probably did the republican movement much more good than harm. Recruitment
to the IRA increased markedly during those seven months, while Sinn Fein
emerged for the first time in the conflict as serious electoral force.
The nationalist people overcame a decade of war-weariness and rallied once
more to the Provos’ banner. The SDLP suffered important setbacks and was
at least partially discredited because of its combined unwillingness and
inability to influence the British, whose rules the party has observed
ever since its inception. There was also an intangible sense in the ghettoes,
not felt so strongly since 1972, that the IRA’s cause was truly just and
must one day prove victorious.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="reportage"></a><b><font size=+1>Reporting the Hunger Strike</font></b>
<p>During the five years of the blanket and dirty protests, the media had
not been particularly critical of the criminalization policy’s assumptions.
How would they respond in the face of a hunger strike to the death? I will
discuss some issues that have framed debates on the media and its treatment
of the political violence, particularly its coverage of the Northern Irish
conflict.
<p>There is a substantial literature on the subject of media coverage of
the Northern Ireland conflict. This includes studies of television, radio,
press, cinema and so on. It also includes studies based on interviews with
and observations of journalists.
<p>Kevin Kelley (1990, p.230) wrote that the 1981 ‘hunger strike has undoubtedly
been the major news story’ to emerge from the conflict in Northern Ireland.
The hunger strike certainly generated unprecedented media publicity. As
Sands’ death drew closer: ‘Some 23 nations sent camera crews, and the American
TV networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, sent 16 camera crews. There were at least 400
reporters in the North, and 300 photographers covered his funeral.’[47]
<p>The 1981 hunger strike lasted a total of 217 days, beginning on March
1 and ending on October 3. The coverage of 15 events (including the hunger
strikers’ deaths and funerals, elections in which they participated, and
the beginning and the end of the protest) amounting to 11 discrete time
periods during the hunger strike was analyzed. The study included the coverage
from 3 days before the hunger strike, 86 days during it, and 6 days after
it, yielding a total of 95 days, which were covered by the study.
<p>The <i>Irish Times</i> gave the hunger strike the most coverage in terms
of columns next came the Times, then the <i>New York Times</i>. The time
period covering the Sands’ death received the most overall coverage. The
<i>New
York Times </i>had the highest proportion of stories which discussed the
hunger striker’s demands, and this paper provided the most contextualization
of the hunger strike. The high proportion of the stories which dealt with
the personal aspects of the hunger strikers, such as the condition of their
health, and on violence gives a more accurate picture of the flavor of
the <i>New York Times </i>coverage. The emphasis of its reporting was consistently
on the human-interest aspects of the hunger strike, such as the hunger
strikers’worsening health. It is also worth mentioning that many of the
stories combined several themes and aspects of the hunger strike. For instance,
a story might contain details of a hunger striker’s health, a mention of
the demand for political status, an account of a march or demonstration
in support of the hunger strike, and an account of violence or law enforcement
which was related to the hunger strike. Because several themes were often
present in a particular <i>New York Times</i> story, the reports tended
to present factual accounts of incidents without placing them in a context
that would render them mean to an audience.
<p>Furthermore, even though about two thirds of the stories in each newspaper
contained some discussion or political aspects of the hunger strike, the
prominence of this theme should not be overestimated. During the course
of the protest, two hunger strikers (Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty ),
another Republican prisoner in the Maze prison, and, following Sand’s death,
his former election agent, were all elected to seats in the Irish and British
Parliaments. This, combined with the prisoners’ demands for political status,
should have ensured that the political dimension of the hunger strike would
be prominent theme in the coverage. Moreover, the stories often made just
a brief mention of the hunger striker’s electoral success, and these stories
were coded as having a political theme present even though their treatment
of the hunger strike’s political dimensions was minimal.
<p>A basic premise of the criminalization policy was that paramilitary
organizations such as the Provisional IRA lacked popular support in Northern
Ireland. By fielding candidates in parliamentary elections and winning
several seats, the Republican movement directly challenged this aspect
of criminalization. Hence, the coverage these elections received was analyzed
to see how this degree of popular support was explained.
<p>The <i>New York Times</i> called Sand’s election a ‘stunning blow to
the Protestant establishment of Northern Ireland.’[48]
<p>The <i>Irish Times</i> had the headline ‘Sands election a propaganda
win for hunger strike’:
<blockquote>the Long Kesh Republican hunger-strike- and by extension the
IRA- won a propaganda victory of enormous proportions yesterday with the
election of the hunger-striker Bobby Sands as the new West-minister MP
for Fermanagh-South Tyrone…His victory has become a serious embarrassment
to the British Government. It also represents a body blow for those…who
have maintained that the vast majority of anti-Unionists do not in any
way wish to be associated with violence or violent organizations.[49]</blockquote>

<p><br>The <i>Times</i> completely ignored the implications of Sand’s electoral
success for the criminalization policy, for public perceptions of the Provisional
IRA, and the entire Northern Ireland conflict. It concentrated instead
on political efforts to expel Sands from parliament. It carried the headline:”
Party leaders to discuss Maze man’s poll victory,” saying that : ‘even
if he is allowed to keep his seat, he is likely to be dead of starvation
soon.’[50]
<p>But while the coverage did suggest that Sands’ election indicated a
higher level of support for militant Republicanism that had previously
been thought to exist, the general tone of the coverage suggested that
the election was less important than reactions to it. There was a constant
focus on the possible implications of Sands’election. These were all considered
from the standpoint of others. It was a propaganda victory for the leadership
of the Republican movement, an embarrassment for the British government,
a blow to political moderates in Northern Ireland, and a procedural issue
for the British parliament in deciding whether or not he should be expelled.
Nowhere was suggestion that Sands’ electoral success constituted the legitimization
of his struggle. Then, following the election of Sands’ former election
agent to the British Parliament, the issue was not the political implications
of his electoral success, but that it gave the sagging Republican movement
a ‘much needed boost in the hunger strike campaign.’[51]
<p>In addition to asserting that paramilitary organizations lacked popular
support, the criminalization policy also promoted the view that members
of these organizations were motivated by selfish criminal gain rather than
by explicitly political goals. By fasting to death, the hunger strikers
challenged this strand of the criminalization policy. But here as with
the coverage of the elections, the focus of the reporting was either on
the security or political implications of the prisoner’s deaths, or reactions
to their deaths, or human-interest aspects of their deaths. The deaths
themselves seemed somewhat peripheral to what the media has identified
as the real issues.
<p>The <i>Times</i> occasionally seemed resentful at the extent of the
general media coverage given to the hunger strikers, and by contrasting
the media response toward Republican funerals to that of the funeral of
P.C. Ellis, the Times hoped to right the balance. Still, there was a continuous
sense that the hunger striker’s recognition was undeserved. In this sense,
the effort to focus attention on the sufferings of ‘innocent’ victims of
the conflict was a direct effort to channel coverage away from the hunger
strikers’funerals. The <i>Irish Times</i> did not appear to parallel with
the view of the Times, which consistently tried to undermine the hunger
strikers’ funerals, seeking to deny them coverage so that the funerals
of ‘real’ victims would not be slighted. The Irish Times repeatedly stressed
the high human costs of the conflict.
<p>The death of Sands received the most coverage during the hunger strike.
As for the deaths of the other nine hunger strikers that died, those who
closely followed Sands received large amount of coverage, but as the hunger
strike wore on, even the newsworthiness of a prisoner starving himself
to death in pursuit of political status began to decline. As the deaths
continued, the coverage in all papers became less personal. A death became
the ‘4<sup>th</sup> death,’ and ultimately no names were mentioned in the
headlines. Simultaneously, the coverage became increasingly concerned with
the violent implications of the hunger striker’s deaths. There was a decreasing
urgency in imparting the news of hunger striker’s death. There were also
stories which contained the news of a hunger striker’s death began to focus
less on the nature of the death and more on the implications it had for
the possibility of ending the strike or for more rioting.
<p>The <i>Irish Times</i> was the most willing to imply in its coverage
that the hunger strike could have been resolved sooner if the authorities
had directly negotiated with the prisoners.
<p>It also published several profiles of those on hunger strike, giving
a full account of their family background and paramilitary involvement.
While the <i>Times</i> also did this on occasion, the Irish Times’ s profiles
included such details as how the hunger strikers first became involved
in paramilitary organizations. Often these accounts gave details of harassment
by the security forces, intimidation at work, or other factors, which helped
place the hunger strikers in a sympathetic light. The general picture created
by the <i>Irish Times</i> was that the hunger strikers were a result of
the Northern Ireland conflict, not a cause of it as the <i>Times</i> suggested.
The <i>Irish Times </i>published in full most of the prisoner’s statements,
which were smuggled out of the Maze, as well as statements from other Republican
sources.
<p><i>New York Times</i> referred to the hunger strikers as ‘guerillas.’
The <i>Times</i> used the term of ‘terrorists’ to describe the prisoners,
and the <i>Irish Times </i>avoided using both terms, referred to them with
terms like ‘Provisional IRA prisoners.’
<p>Two broad themes emerged from the <i>Times’ coverage</i>. The first
one of these was reflected in all three newspapers: it was the concern
that the hunger strike would increase tension and lead to more violence.
This focus on the implications of the hunger strike rather than on the
hunger strike itself, meant that the nature of this protest and the support
it received were never discussed fully. The second theme to emerge was
that the hunger strike was a ‘propaganda’ exercise. The Times published
several stories with headlines such as ‘The Ulster Propaganda War,’ ‘The
H-Block Propaganda War.’
<p>By calling the hunger strike a ‘propaganda war’ and reporting it as
such, the <i>Times</i> had to explain the hunger strikers’ ultimate commitment
and as well as their electoral success. It did this by claiming on several
occasions that the IRA leaders had ordered the hunger strikers to fast
to death, and that the elections had been won due to the existence of a
sinister ‘propaganda machine.’
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="conclusion"></a><b><font size=+1>Conclusion</font></b>
<p>The criminalization process has been discussed in several major works,
but those studies have focused on the process of making previously legal
behavior illegal. In the Northern Irish context the criminalization policy
involved phasing out the ‘special status’ of political criminals and giving
them in its place the status of ‘ordinary’ criminals. Of course, political
violence is criminal in that it violates legal status, but the motivations
of the participants and the explicitly political goals of their actions
usually distinguish politically motivated crime from other forms of criminality.
<p>However, the policy of using the normal criminal justice system, albeit
one with special powers, to respond to social crises such as the Northern
Irish conflict has been costly. This expansion of the security forces’
powers has severely infringed on the civil liberties of the general population
(Boyle 1980, 1982). Furthermore, arming the police and courts with special
powers has undermined the public’ confidence in the criminal justice system.
<p>The existence of repressive legislation, aggressive policing styles,
and special courts have undoubtedly lent support to paramilitary organizations’
claims that the Northern Irish State is indeed based on coercion. Continuing
support for these organizations can partly be understood in this light.
<p>It is not my purpose to argue that convicted members of paramilitary
organizations should be accorded a status different from that of ordinary
prisoners, but the 1981 hunger strike clearly demonstrated the limits of
the criminalization policy. The labeling of political violence as ordinary
criminal behavior can achieve no more than minimal success as a response
to the Northern Irish conflict so long as those who are engaged in political
violence and the communities which support them reject their criminal label.
(Burton 1979, 1978).
<p>Given the consequences of the criminalization policy, it is possible
that other strategies may produce more desirable results. Colin Crawford
(1982, 1979), a former social worker in the Maze prison, suggested that
there were tangible benefits to reverting to the special category status
system. First, this system was much less costly than regular prison regimes.
Furthermore, it was also one of the few situations in which the different
paramilitary organizations cooperated in the pursuit of common goals. The
inmates also benefited from the increased autonomy they had under this
system. Finally, Crawford argued that emphasizing the prisoners’ special
status would make them less susceptible to criminal stigmatization and
as a result less likely to recidivate. Thus to offer politically motivated
criminals a non-criminal status might be a more fruitful approach to the
Northern Irish conflict.
<p>How do we account for the willingness of ten convicted men to starve
themselves to death in pursuit of political prisoner status? Did the 1981
hunger strike exemplify the alleged irrationality and pathology of terrorism
or was it one of the ‘struggles for legitimacy’ that Burton suggested characterized
the relationship between militant Republicanism and the Nationalist community?
In this work I have suggested that the hunger strike was an effort on the
part of Republican prisoners to establish the legitimacy of their use of
violence for the achievement of political goals. This hunger strike was
unique due to the number of prisoners who died on their fasts, but it was
just one further episode in the continuing history of politically motivated
prisoners’ struggles for recognition.[52]
<p>The British authorities, when confronted with the prospect of prisoners
fasting to death, had to account for such behavior. Why would ‘criminals’
willingly give up their lives when selfishness is held to be the epitome
of criminality? Perhaps because they had been ordered to do so? Perhaps
because they were terrorists who were not susceptible to rational argument
and who were seeking unrealistic if not impossible demands? Burton (1979,
1977) suggested that when the legitimacy of a state is challenged it engages
in a variety of defensive techniques which they termed ‘official discourse.’
These are primarily efforts on the part of the political establishments
to ‘save face.’ Burton noted that these strategies can take several forms,
but they have been especially visible in the official reports of committees
investigating controversial events in Northern Ireland. These techniques
to maintain governmental legitimacy in the face of official misconduct
include claiming that the opposition’s allegations are unfounded. Claiming
that, even if there is substance to the allegations, the behavior in question
did not reflect policy but an isolated incident; and claiming that those
making the allegations have no mandate from the community to make representations
on its behalf. In relation to the Northern Irish conflict, official sources
have used all of these techniques to explain a wide variety of Republican
activities.
<p>In the end the hunger strikes were about the actions of men who had
reached the breaking point, who chose the ultimate form of protest in order
to resolve the prison issue one way or the other. They had two choices:
either unending years on the dirty protest or surrender; one was impossible,
the other unthinkable.’ What the hunger strike became, ‘Gerry Adams said,
‘was a struggle of wills as personified by Thatcher’s public utterances:
‘ the IRA are playing their last card, we’re not going to give in inch.’[53]
And as personified by what Bobby Sands was writing about: ‘we are an Irish
Nation, we have the right to be free, I am a political soldier, I am a
political prisoner, I am not a criminal.’

<li>
<font size=-1>Adams’ and his party Sinn Fein’s opposition to the hunger
strike had to do partly with that difficulty, partly with the fact that
close personal relationships existed between the prisoners themselves and
between the prisoners and republicans on the outside. They all knew that
they were entering a period of intense anguish. But primarily they opposed
it because they did not believe that it would succeed in moving the British
government.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>From its beginnings in 1973, The RZ differentiated itself
by taking exception to the RAF theory, that only the ‘ revolutionary intelligentsia,’
or student elite should guide the revolution. Instead, they stressed the
need to keep each action in contact with the masses, a kind of Maoist ‘mass
line.’</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>The 1989-90 West Berlin government rested on a coalition
of the Social Democrats, and the Alternative List, which has long included
elements of the Berlin ‘ alternative scene’ sympathetic to urban protest.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>According to David T.Schiller ‘ Germany’s Other Terrorists,’
in Terrorism 9 (1987), p.57-65, only a small fraction of some 350 terrorist
acts and 500 acts of sabotage could be attributed to the RAF itself.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Their membership declined in 1984-85 from about 200 to 80.
The RAF at that time was believed to have a ‘commando’ of about 15 and
a ‘legitimate fringe’ of 200, not counting 36 members in custody.</font></li>
