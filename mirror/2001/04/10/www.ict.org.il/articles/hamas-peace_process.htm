<p>The prospect of progress in the political process, together with the
formation of a Palestinian state on only part of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, is unacceptable to the Hamas leadership. Since the formation of
the new Israeli government the movement’s leaders have expressed support
for the continuation of the armed struggle against Israel. They have expressed
fierce opposition to the PA’s policies, in the hopes that the “jihad” operations
will sabotage the peace process.
<p>Researchers, politicians and the Israeli public at large have questioned
the intentions and strategy of Hamas since the advent of the Netanyahu
government in 1996 and whether this has altered over the past year in the
wake of the signing of the Wye Plantation agreement.
<p>The suicide terrorist attacks in February/March 1996 by Hamas and the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) were held responsible for the change in
the Israeli public’s mind and the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud
party in the June 1996 elections.
<p>After the elections, it seemed that Hamas was satisfied with the result
of its terrorist strategy, with the difficulties in the negotiations and
with the stalemate of the political process. This was in keeping with its
conviction that any compromise with Israel is contrary to the interests
of the Palestinian people, and with the long-term objectives of the Islamic
movement: to liberate all of Palestine and convert it in an Islamic state.
<p>The low profile of Hamas terrorist activity during the last three years
was sometimes interpreted as a strategy intended to leave space for the
continuation of Netanyahu’s rule and, implicitly, for the continuation
of the crisis in relations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel.
<p><b>Operational difficulties for Hamas’s terrorist activity</b>
<p>In reality, the sharp decline in the terrorist attacks, particularly
the bloody suicide bombings, was due to the combined preventive counter-terrorist
policy of the PA and Israel.
<p>The PIJ, the smallest radical Islamist organization, was greatly weakened
after the killing of its leader, Fathi Shkaki, in Malta in October 1995,
allegedly by Israeli agents. Hamas for its part continued it’s attempts
to perpetrate suicide attacks during Netanyahu’s term. (see a partial list
of Hamas’s terrorist attacks in <a href="#annex I">Annex I</a>)
<p>In October 1998 ICT researcher Reuven Paz pointed out a change or rethinking
of Hamas’s terrorist tactics, as conveyed in several articles published
by prominent figures in Hamas. One of these articles was published in the
October 1998 issue of the monthly <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>, the principal
organ of Hamas, under the very unambiguous title: “A new method of military
resistance in Palestine.”
<p>The article hints at a new phase in Hamas: a “green light” to the various
Hamas groups in the West Bank, mainly in the Hebron area, to initiate independent
operations. In Paz’s estimation, one reason for this change may be the
difficult situation of Hamas activists there and the possible increase
in surveillance by Palestinian security forces, concomitant with the discovery
of some of its “laboratories” and the pressure on the Palestinian Authority
to increase its cooperation with Israel. Among the setbacks suffered by
the Movement were the killing of Muhi al-Din al-Sharif in March 1998; the
subsequent arrests of Hamas political and military leaders; and the killing
of the Awadallah brothers in September 1998. The article gives the impression
that the main concern of Hamas is to cover up its movements and leave them
vague, due to the pressure it is confronting from both Israel and the PA.
<p>In April 1999 <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i> published an annual report
of the terrorist operations of the `Iz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades for 1998.
Reuven Paz stresses again that in the commentary to the report the movement
emphasizes that its combatants had to contend with difficult conditions
during 1998, due to the fact that the security coordination between the
Palestinian and the Israeli security services has reached new heights,
under the supervision of the CIA. According to the report, the operations
in 1998 were characterized by the use of time bombs and commando attacks
with hand grenades and armed ambushes of shooting with light weapons. There
was only one suicide attack. This was due to an effort to preserve the
variety of methods of operations, and to conserve the lives of the fighters
for other types of missions. The report admits that in general there was
a decline in Hamas’s terrorist activity in 1998. There was also a decline
in Israeli human casualties, due to the fact that there was only one suicide
attack.
<p>The successful counter-terrorist policy of Israel and the PA as the
main reason for Hamas’s military weakness appears in numerous interviews
by leading members of the organization (see <a href="#annex II">Annex II
</a>for
a partial list of the main blows to Hamas’s operational infrastructure).
<p>The Jordanian newspaper <i>Al-Urdun</i> interviewed Hamas spokesman
Ibrahim Ghosheh on 24 Oct. 1998 and asked him why, following the attempt
on Khaled Mash’al’s life in Jordan and the assassination of the Awdallah
brothers in the West Bank, Hamas threatened to take revenge, but did nothing
to carry it out. Ghosheh cited Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in an interview:
“For two years now, almost since I took over in June 1996, the security
organs have not stopped tracking down al-Qassam operations and foiling
operations almost daily.” As to the Palestinian security organs, Ghosheh
said, “they, too, have not stopped hunting down our mujahidin….The fact
is, Palestinian security organs know every detail. They are the ones which
laid their hands on the explosives factory for the mujahidin in Nabulus
and before that the ones in Bayt Sahur and Hebron. It was the PA security
organs which seized the materials which the mujahidin use in their struggle.”
<p>Nevertheless, Ghosheh promised that Hamas “will resist through awareness,
popular move, and the forces that can go ahead with their jihad, as jihad
operations will be the best reply to this conspiracy. We know that many
jihad operations have produced significant political results…Our Palestinian
people are very close to Hamas’ program. Resistance should take place every
day at least with stabs or shooting from machine guns, and this is what
the Zionist planners have failed to curb.”
<p>Mussa Abu-Marzuq was asked by Hamas’s monthly <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>
on June, 1st 1999 what was the reason for the absence of the Hamas movement
from the military field during this time? He replied that the “absence
was not a decision but an expression of the realities of the balance of
forces on the ground. Struggle and jihad are in an ebb and tide. Those
who have rights will not allow their rights to be blown with the wind.
They strongly believe that jihad is the way to regain our rights and protect
our honor.”
<p>The same day, Khaled Mash’al, Head of the Hamas Political Bureau, was
interviewed by the Lebanese <i>al-Diyar</i> and asked why the operations
mounted by Hamas inside Israel have fallen in number. Mash’al replied:
<dir><font size=-1>“There is no change in Hamas’ view that resistance must
continue. Resistance in Palestine, however, is being subjected to immense
pressure and challenges. The situation in Palestine is the exact opposite
of that in Lebanon, which possesses an abundance of positive factors. Naturally,
this pleases us and we hail this embracing of the resistance by the people
and the government, the political cover provided by Syria, and the Islamic
support extended by Iran. As for Palestine, the resistance is subjected
to a trilateral security siege…the Zionists, the Palestinian Authority,
and the United States, represented by CIA intervention…”</font></dir>
The “internal” leadership gave more or less the same explanations for Hamas’
operational weakness. Mahmud Al-Zahhar from Gaza spoke to the London <i>Al-Majallah</i>
(15-21 Aug. 1999) on the difficulties facing Hamas:
<dir><font size=-1>“The modus operandi of resistance in Hamas depends upon
military targets, soldiers and settlers. But major restrictions, especially
after the signing of the Wye River agreement, prevented the implementation
of a large number of operations. The Palestinian jails are full of the
sons of Hamas who were arrested as they were trying to carry out operations
or as a result of confessions. Some of these operations were aborted the
last minute… Hence, the operations continue but the attempts to abort them
also continue. It is a real war in which we win one and lose one.”</font></dir>
Ramadan Abdallah Shalah, the secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad (PIJ) addressed the same issue in an interview with the Dubai <i>Al-Bayan</i>
(29 Jul. 1999)
<dir><font size=-1>“Carrying out military operations inside Palestine depends
on the circumstances and resources of the strugglers there. Any objective
observer can see the security cooperation that is taking place among the
Israeli occupation authorities, the Palestinian Authority and the CIA with
a view to encircling and aborting the Jihad action while it is still in
the phase of formation. They are arresting and liquidating our strugglers...We,
in the Islamic Jihad Movement, are facing enormous challenges and obstacles.
Even our military action is the target of distortion, fabrications and
a dirty psychological warfare being waged by the proponents of the Oslo
accords. Nevertheless, the will for Jihad and martyrdom still exists in
our people.”</font></dir>
In an interview to the <i>Al-Majallah</i>, Isma’il Abu-Shanab, a leading
figure of Hamas in Gaza, declared (October 3, 1999) that regarding the
paralysis of Hamas’s military wing there are objective circumstances and
reasons that should be kept in mind.
<dir><font size=-1>“The first is the change in the Palestinian reality
brought about by the presence of a Palestinian authority, and hence the
absence of the factor of direct friction with the occupation… [and] the
continuing pursuits, not only by the Israeli side but also by the PA. This
has limited the resistance activities. The political changes have another
dimension that affects the resistance’s ability and efficiency at the present
stage. But this does not mean at all that … that the military wing has
become paralyzed. There is ebb and flow in the action and this happens
in all revolutions and military operations in the world.”</font></dir>
<b>The attempts of September 1999 – a revival of Hamas’s bombing strategy?</b>
<p>It is not yet completely clear who organized the double car-bomb attacks
in Tiberias and Haifa on September 5. But the arrest of Israeli Arabs connected
with the event have proven connections between these militants of the Islamic
Movement in Israel and Hamas activists in Gaza, the West Bank and Jordan.
<p>Three terrorists died in the explosions, while a fourth, who had been
in the car in Haifa shortly before it exploded, was later arrested by the
security forces. All were known to be members of the Islamic Movement in
Israel, a legal organization. One of the dead men was believed to be involved
in a Hamas suicide attack in the city of Afula, in 1994, when his ID card
was found on the body of the suicide terrorist.
<p>The arrested activist told police that he and his partner, as well as
the team in Tiberias were to have loaded the bombs onto inter-city buses.
One of the terrorists would have loaded the bomb, ridden on the bus and
then disembarked before the bomb exploded, making his getaway in a car
driven by the second terrorist.
<p>It is clear that Hamas has both the motivation and the intention to
perpetrate terrorist attacks that could derail the new track taken by the
peace process between Israel and the PA after the signing of the Sharm
al-Sheikh agreement for the implementation of the Wye Protocol.
<p>According to the monthly <i>Palestinian Times</i> (September 1999),
which can be considered the mouthpiece of Hamas, the Islamic movement has
apparently decided to resume armed attacks on Israeli targets, particularly
Israeli soldiers and settlers “after a self-imposed moratorium lasting
nearly ten months.”
<p>According to this information, this decision has found expression in
a series of shootings and ambushes in the West Bank and in Israel. The
most serious of these occurred on 10 August when Akram Alkam, a 23-year-old
Palestinian youth from a Bethlehem refugee camp rammed his car into a group
of Israeli soldiers awaiting rides to their bases, injuring eight soldiers
before he was himself shot dead.
<p>The suicide-driver didn’t have any “formal” affiliation with Hamas.
However, says the newspaper, a strong hint of the movement’s influence
was sufficiently clear in his behavior. Hamas eventually did take credit
for the operation.
<p><i>Palestinian Times</i> stresses the fact that an ordinary, un-indoctrinated
Palestinian like Alkam was willing to carry out “martyrdom operations”
with his own meager means, which should be viewed as a striking success
for Hamas.
<p>“The movement, after all, can now boast of succeeding in transforming
‘martyrdom’ from a political faction’s monopoly into a popular practice,
which makes it all the more difficult for Israel and, for that matter,
its subservient puppet entity, Yasser Arafat’s PA, to control future attacks
against Zionist targets,” writes <i>PT</i>.
<p>The Hamas military wing, ‘Iz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, took credit
for at least one other attack: the shooting incident in the Old City of
Hebron in early August in which two Jewish settlers were wounded. Three
other incidents, including one near the northern West Bank town of Jenin,
in which an Israeli immigrant from the former Soviet Union was killed,
are also believed to have been carried out by Hamas.
<p>A fourth attack was probably aborted when an explosive device went off
inside a storehouse in Hebron on 15 August. PA police said two Islamist
brothers, who had been released from Israeli jails after serving a five-year
jail sentence for belonging to Hamas, were preparing a plastic toy-car
bomb attack for detonation at an Israeli settlement site in downtown Hebron.
<p><i>Palestinian Times</i> claims that so far the attacks have been “relatively
minor and generally un-qualitative in nature,” but that the message they
were intended to convey was sufficiently clear for all parties concerned,
particularly Israel and the PA.
<p><b>Hamas attempts to rebuild its military and political infrastructure</b>
<p>However, according to the September issue of <i>Palestinian Times</i>,
Hamas’ military wing has been undergoing an arduous process of rebuilding
and restructuring following the killing of a number of its top leaders
by Israeli soldiers and undercover agents in the last few years.
<p>The Hamas leadership is convinced that the terrorist campaign is in
the interests of the Palestinians in the long run. Moreover, a Hamas official
based in Jordan alleged that renewed attacks on Israel would actually strengthen
the Palestinian negotiating position. According to <i>PT</i>, a senior
Hamas official in Ramallah stated that “the resumption of armed struggle
against the Zionist entity carries with it the message that there can be
no real peace or stability in this region as long as the Palestinians don’t
receive their dues in full.”
<p>More important, claims <i>Palestinian Times</i>, is the fact that Hamas
has probably come to realize that it no longer has much to lose by renewing
attacks on Israeli targets. After all, the PA continues to intern hundreds
of Islamist activists without charge or trial, apparently to appease Israel
and the United States and to ward off their tendentious charges that the
PA isn’t combating terrorism effectively. Hamas doesn’t place all the blame
for these arrests, and, indeed, for the continued and seemingly open-ended
incarceration of its internees in PA custody, solely on the PA. Israel
remains the prime and ultimate culprit in forcing the PA to act virtually
at its beck and call. This, Hamas reasons, makes armed struggle against
Israel inevitable even if dangerous.
<p>Another reason for the enhanced activity of Hamas was presented on the
Movement’s Internet site on Sept. 5, 1999: the mounting pressure on the
organization to kidnap Israeli soldiers as a bargaining chip for its own
imprisoned militants. One Islamist activist said “the Islamic movement
will have to do something to give our prisoners hope…Arafat doesn’t represent
us, and he doesn’t give a damn if our brothers remained in Zionist jails
for thirty years to come…we have to do something.”
<p>The Hamas leadership has not contented itself with political declarations,
but has stepped up its military activity, mainly ambushes against Israeli
settlers and army vehicles, and possibly attempts to kidnap Israeli soldiers.
It is also possible that some of the terrorist attacks considered to be
“private initiatives” by Palestinians stem from the intensive indoctrination
and propaganda of Hamas leaders in support of the “popular” jihad against
the “oppressor.” The last in this series of “minor” terrorist attacks could
be the murder of two young Israeli students on the night of August 30 near
Megiddo, in Israel.
<p>Hamas is also attempting to extend its influence in the Palestinian
refugee camps in Lebanon, where Fatah’s influence is weak. In this framework
it has formed the “Association of Religious Palestinian Leaders in Lebanon,”
with the blessing of Hizballah’s mentor, Sheikh Fadlallah, and has intensified
its dialog with Hizballah leaders.
<p>At the same time the Hamas leadership has refused to accept a dialog
with the PA in the framework of a united Palestinian front in preparation
for negotiations on the final settlement. This unification has already
received the blessing, in principle, of the George Habbash’s Popular Front
(PFLP) and Nayef Hawatmeh’s Democratic Front (DPFLP).
<p>Hamas has instead proposed, according to the <i>Jordan Times</i> (August
26, 1999) the formation of a new umbrella organization, a “national body”
to replace the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which it describes
as obsolete. Hamas is involved in intensive deliberations with Palestinian
opposition factions to form the new organization before the end of this
year.
<p>Hamas leaders have stepped up contacts and visits with their allies
in Lebanon, Syria and Iran, with the intention of forming a united front
against the PA and Israel. Khaled Masha’al met with Syrian Vice President
Abd al-Halim and Foreign Minister Farouk a-Shara to discuss developments
in the peace process and the positions of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
<p><b>The Jordanian Move against Hamas</b>
<p>Following the signing of the Wye Plantation agreement in October 1998,
the Hamas leaders in Jordan made passionate statements calling for the
continuation of military operations against Israel.
<p>Ibrahim Ghosheh, spokesman for Hamas, declared in an interview to <i>Al-Urdun</i>
in Amman, on 15 October 1998, that the movement is eager to avoid “the
mutilation of the national fabric ... in the interest of the Palestinian
people.” But, he hinted, “this clear and strong Hamas position, which is
appreciated by foes even before friends, cannot be guarantee forever”—a
veiled threat against the PA if it goes ahead with the agreement’s implementation.
“The PA must not continue its present policy and think that Hamas and its
leadership will not respond to agents, who cooperate with Jews and hand
them mujahidin, weapons, and ammunitions,” he said.
<p>In an interview to the French <i>Liberation</i> on July 6, 1999, Sheikh
Yassin declared that there is no alternative to military action and promised
that the military wing would act in the near future to prove that it exists.
In another interview, to <i>Al-Sharq al-Awsat</i> on August 19, Yassin
stressed that his movement’s position on military action against Israel
was firm and has not changed, due to of the continuing Israeli occupation
of Palestine. Regarding claims by some Palestinian security sources about
recent military moves by Hamas, Sheikh Yassin stressed that “the sons of
the ‘Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, are the ones
who decide when, how, and where to operate according to the conditions
they face and their resources.”
<p>The Hamas leaders in Jordan have also amply reaffirmed such militant
statements to the Arab and international media. At a meeting in August
with Syrian officials, Hamas political bureau chief Khaled Masha’al said
that Hamas would continue its “jihad, struggle and uprising against the
occupation.” Musa Abu-Marzuq declared in an interview to <i>Filastin Al-Muslimah</i>
that Hamas’ role “lies in clinging to Palestinian rights, in fighting the
enemy, in activating jihad against the enemy in all spheres, and in mobilizing
the Palestinian people, the Arab nation, and the Muslim nation along this
course.”
<p>The arrest of Hamas militants in Amman at the end of August 1999, the
closure of the organization’s journal and offices in the Jordanian capital,
is intended to prevent the radical Islamic elements from sabotaging the
political process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. This is
true as well of the arrest in mid-September of two top Hamas leaders—Khaled
Masha’al and Ibrahim Ghosheh—on their return from a visit to Tehran, and
the expulsion of Musa Abu Marzouk from Jordan.
<p>The Hamas leaders were charged with “belonging to an illegal organization,”
storing weapons and conducting military training exercises in the Kingdom.
Hamas has denied all the charges. However, the Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Raouf al-Rawabdeh accused Hamas of using Jordan as a training base,
storing weapons in its offices and harming Jordan’s national security.
<p>In spite of the seemingly resolute Jordanian position concerning the
necessity to punish the Hamas leadership and neutralize its activity, intensive
negotiations for their release and the achievement of an agreement between
the two sides have begun, with the active mediation of the Muslim Brotherhood
leadership in Jordan.
<p>Musa Abu Marzouk, in an interview with the United Arab Emirates’s <i>Al-Khaleej</i>
said that a bid was being made to discuss and redefine the relationship
between Hamas and the Jordanian government. In a public address to King
Abdallah II on September22, Marzouk stated that Hamas had no intention
of carrying out any military operations against Jordan even if the Hamas
leaders were not released. “Hamas will never target anyone from the Ummah
and will never change its policy especially in dear Jordan… The Movement’s
pendulum will remain directed against the Zionist enemy,” he wrote.
<p>But at the same time veiled threats were directed towards the Jordanian
government. A Palestinian Islamist official has warned that the recent
Jordanian measures against Hamas could push the Islamist movement toward
extremism and radicalism. “The Jordanian authorities think that Hamas will
cower and lower its head as a result of these measures, the opposite is
true in reality. These measures could embolden Hamas and force it to cross
certain red lines,” said Sheikh Hussein Yousef Suleiman, a prominent Islamist
official in the Bethlehem area. Suleiman didn’t say what these red lines
were, but hinted “Hamas would not cave in to pressure under any circumstances”
(see Hamas’s website <i>http://www.palestine-info.net/index_e.htm</i>).
<p>According to Agence France Press (September 1), the armed wing of Hamas
even warned that it would hit Jewish targets “in the region and around
the world” following the closure of its offices in Amman.
<p>Jordan came under mounting pressure from the Muslim Brotherhood and
opposition groups to free the Hamas leaders, amid mass demonstrations in
the Palestinian refugee camps and a hunger strike by the jailed Hamas leaders.
<p>At the end of October it seemed that a formula for the end of the crisis
between the two parties had been reached. The official Jordanian news agency,
Petra
quoted King Abdallah on October 23 as saying that he was confident Jordan
would be able to resolve outstanding differences with Hamas “in the context
of rule of law, and maintaining Jordan’s sovereignty and security.”
<p>This formula could include the liberation of the jailed leaders without
trial and their stay in Jordan, as “Jordanian citizens,” without any link
to Hamas, according to Jordanian governmental sources, or under a symbolic
presence of Hamas in the kingdom, according to Hamas sources.
<p>It seems that the implementation of this agreement has been postponed
because of differences of opinion between the more extremist leaders jailed
in Jordan and the more moderate Musa Abu Marzouk. These differences led
to the resignation of several of the lawyers involved in the defense team.
<p>For the time being Jordanian authorities continue their pressure on
Hamas. On November 9 they arrested Izzat al Risheq, a member of the Hamas
politburo, for belonging to an illegal organization, along with two journalists,
who were charged with “hiding a fugitive.” The Jordanian government continues
to demand that Muhammad Nazal, a member of the Hamas political office and
its representative in Jordan, be handed over, in accordance with arrest
warrants issued against him since the crisis broke out.
<p>A reliable Hamas source, cited on November 12 by the organization’s
website, stated that “this sudden escalation of the crisis …threatens the
current good offices that seek to find a political solution to the crisis…and
puts to an end the hopes created by these good offices.”
<p>The Jordanian<i> Al-Dustur</i> observed on October 30 that all issues
between Hamas and the government remain an object of dispute, ranging from
the presence of Hamas offices in Amman—particularly its political bureau—to
other minor and formal details. At issue too is the future of Hamas leaders
who bear Jordanian nationality and whether they will be allowed to work
in Jordan and retain their titles.
<p>Hence, a Hamas source told <i>Al-Sharq al-Awsat</i> on November 4, “Hamas
is preparing itself to deal with any possibilities and unexpected results
from the mediation being conducted by the Muslim Brotherhood [with] the
Jordanian Government…Within the framework of the search for an alternative,
the movement has now reached the conclusion that it should not put all
its eggs in one basket; that is, members of its Political Bureau should
not live in one particular country.” Hamas could place its leaders in Damascus,
Sanaa, Tehran, Khartoum, and other capitals in which the movement has a
presence.
<p><b>Hamas strategy during the negotiations for the final agreement</b>
<p>Wafa Amr, a <i>Reuters </i>commentator (September 23, 1999) analyzed
the future options for Hamas’ activity in light of the recent events and
developments. He cited Palestinian political analyst Khalil Shikaki, director
of the Center for Palestine Research and Studies in Nablus, who thinks
that the internal Hamas leadership will be strengthened, at the expense
of Hamas’ ability to become a regional power. According to Shikaki, as
Hamas’ military leadership is mainly based in Syria and Iran, the group’s
ability to carry out attacks might not change in the immediate future.
<p>Hamas militants have been weakened by the killing of their most accomplished
bomb makers and by Yasser Arafat’s clamp-down, according to Amr. Many analysts,
he says, think that Hamas’s priorities will now shift to consolidating
a social and political network in the Palestinian-ruled West Bank and Gaza
even while continuing attacks on Israel.
<p>Ismail Abu Shanab, a senior Gaza-based Hamas official told <i>Reuters</i>
that Hamas was debating how to structure its leadership and whether it
should be based in Palestinian areas or in exile. He hinted that basing
the main activity abroad, like the PLO in its time, is not the best choice.
Concerning the terrorist activity, as long as Israel respects Palestinian
civilians, then the policy of not attacking Israeli civilians will not
change. Abu Shanab told <i>Reuters</i>, “The policy will be to attack the
Israeli military.”
<p>The same Abu-Shanab told <i>al-Majallah</i> on October 3 that the negotiations
process does not satisfy the Palestinian people’s ambitions. Hamas wants
“to be the vanguard that carries the banner of the Palestinian right until
the Palestinian people retrieve their legitimate national rights. Therefore
the resistance will continue under all conditions, even if there is a final
solution.”
<p>The same issue of <i>al-Majallah</i> carried an interview with Maj.
Gen. Nasr Yusuf, Director General of the Palestinian Security Department
and Member of the Fatah Movement’s Central Committee. In his opinion, the
fate of the military wing after the final settlement will be linked to
the fate of Hamas itself, which, he says, will turn into a political party.
<p>Yusuf estimated that there will be many local, regional, and international
arrangements that will hinder the military wing’s activities and hence
will make it very difficult for Hamas to continue terrorist actions. This
means that the final settlement will include arrangements that will spell
the end of the Hamas military wing. This in turn will give Hamas only one
choice, namely that of political action within the framework of the Palestinian
state.
<p>Yet, said Yusuf, Hamas’s military wing is still capable of influencing
the peace process, “regardless of the blows dealt to it either by the Israeli
or the Palestinian security measures. [The] movement is capable of building
itself despite the conditions around it and the difficulties it is now
facing.”
<p>According to analysts cited by Amr, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin’s release from
the Israeli prison strengthened the Palestinian-based leadership. But the
exiled leaders had maintained an upper hand because they held the key to
Hamas’ finances and had helped to mobilize regional backing for the group.
Khalil Shikaki maintains that the big attacks have to be personally approved
by Sheikh Yassin and all the other leaders. “But this does not mean that
smaller attacks would not be carried out because they don’t require a political
decision.”
<p><b>Pressure on Hamas bears fruit</b>
<p>Notwithstanding the very militant and aggressive statements of the last
year—both by the external leadership and Sheikh Yassin and other internal
leaders—Hamas has been forced to downplay its involvement in the latest
bombings in Israel. This, in spite of the manifest attempts to perpetrate
terrorist attacks even on a small scale and instill life into the declining
activity of its military wing
<p>A leading Hamas figure in the West Bank, Sheikh Hasan Yusuf, in an interview
to the Palestinian <i>Al-Ayyam</i> (October 7), denied the involvement
of Hamas or any of its leaders in recruiting or training the perpetrators
of the two operations in Tiberias and Haifa.
<p>Sheikh Ahmed Yassin himself, cited by <i>PT </i>(November 1999), denied
“rumors suggesting that Hamas was seeking to recruit Israeli Arabs,” saying
the Movement understood the “special situation of our brothers across the
Green Line.”
<p>According to the same source,<i> </i>Yassin went so far as to propose
an open-ended moratorium on attacking Israeli and Palestinian civilians
by both sides. “The Ezzul Deen al-Qassam (sic!) fighters are aware that
Islam is against targeting civilians who are non-combatants.” He suggested
that attacks by Hamas’s military wing on Israeli civilians were mostly
a reaction to Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians, including the murder
of 29 worshipers by an Israeli settler in February of 1994.
<p>Yassin’s proposals were reinforced by an ‘Iz al-Din al-Qassam statement,
cited on October 12 by AFP<i>, </i>that it was ready to stop attacks on
Israeli civilians if several conditions were met. “We are ready to exclude
Jewish civilians from our operations provided that Israel stops its settlement
activities, and land confiscation, and that the Israeli army as well as
the settlers stop attacking Palestinian civilians.”
<p>The Hamas reaction was even more ambiguous after three pipe bombs exploded
simultaneously in Netanya on November 7, injuring 27 people, two of them
seriously. The three bombs, plus a fourth found by police as they searched
the area of the explosions, appeared to police experts to be of the same
make as pipe bombs found near the Netanya police station last August.
<p>The day before, November 6, 1999, ‘Iz al-Din al-Qassam warned in a statement
that it was preparing to escalate its armed attacks against Israel despite
its pledge in October not to target civilians. “The Zionist regime, in
the coming weeks and months, should prepare itself for a wave of armed
attacks, which will take different forms,” reported AFP. “Because of its
stupidity and arrogance, the Zionist government has missed a historic opportunity
to keep Israeli civilians from being part of our operations and spare innocents
on both sides the horrors of bloodshed,” it said. On October 25 in Bethlehem
an Israeli soldier had killed a Palestinian who tried to stab him, although
Palestinian police and eyewitnesses denied there had been any such attempt.
<p>Although this statement was immediately published on the Hamas website,
Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the movement’s leaders in the Gaza Strip,
doubted its credibility because it was carried by AFP<i>, </i>a press agency
with which, he said, the al-Qassam battalions usually do not deal!
<p>On the same Hamas website, Sheikh Yassin reiterated earlier statements
that Hamas wouldn’t target civilians and didn’t seek to harm relations
with the Palestinian Authority. Ismai’il Abu Shanab, a senior Gaza-based
Hamas official said he was sure Hamas had nothing to do with the incident
and suggested that other groups might be responsible for the attack.
<p>According to the assessment of the Israeli defense establishment, as
reported by the Israeli <i>Haaretz</i> on November 12, 1999, Hamas has
ceased carrying out suicide bombings in Israel for tactical reasons. “The
organization now appears to prefer planting bombs, having reached the conclusion
that the use of suicide bombers enables Israel to find those behind the
attacks by means of DNA tests performed on the bodies of the suicides,”
reports
<i>Haaretz</i>.
<p>According to this report, in the terrorist attacks in Jerusalem in 1997,
Hamas tried to hide the identity of the perpetrators. The labels were removed
from their clothing and the terrorists scraped the skin off their fingertips
to prevent identification by means of fingerprints. Nevertheless, DNA testing
enabled the bodies to be identified, which afterward led to the uncovering
of the terrorist ring involved.
<p>The two attacks perpetrated by Israeli Arabs in Tiberias and Haifa in
September, both of which were organized by Hamas, were not planned as suicide
missions. Three of the four terrorists involved were killed when the bombs
they were transporting to the central bus station exploded prematurely.
<p>The pipe bombs in Netanya were also not suicide missions, though the
method employed demonstrated the low technical level of the perpetrators.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>The behavior of Hamas’s military wing and the numerous declarations
of its political leaders during the last year, show that the organization
is earnestly interested in perpetrating major terrorist attacks. The goal
of such attacks would be to interrupt the peace process and to show that
Hamas stands in the vanguard of the struggle for the liberation of all
of Palestine.
<p>Nevertheless, the blows its military apparatus—especially at the senior
and medium level—suffered during the last two years at the hands of the
Israeli and PA’s security forces have seriously hampered these efforts.
These setbacks have brought about not only a reduction in the number of
attacks but also a sharp decline in the operational capabilities of its
militants.
<p>These limitations in operational effectiveness have been obvious in
the (temporary?) abandonment of suicide attacks, the use of unprepared
and poorly trained Israeli Arabs and the call to “the Palestinian masses”
to return to the use of the knife and the stone, as in the old days of
the <i>intifadah</i>. The fact that Hamas has taken responsibility <i>post
factum</i> for small terrorist attacks or attempts perpetrated by locally
organized groups or individuals also illustrates the difficulties it encounters
in recruiting and training expert terrorists.
<p>Moreover, the Jordanian move against the external leadership, has certainly
produced a serious disruption in Hamas’s logistical, financial and operational
infrastructure, and neutralized, at least for the time being, the more
extremist elements in the leadership.
<p>The new situation strengthens the position of the internal leadership
vis-&agrave;-vis the external leadership, with which seemingly it has disputed
lately on the strategy and the timing of the terrorist attacks. The new
situation has to be taken into account by the [so far] free leaders, especially
those in Gaza and the West Bank, in their decision-making process concerning
the future of terrorist activity. At the same time this makes them more
vulnerable to the counter-measures of the Palestinian Authority. This does
not mean that Hamas cannot reorganize operationally and again become a
critical threat to the peace process.
<p>According to the evaluation of the Israeli military intelligence organs,
the PA is attempting to prevent “strategic” terrorist attacks—those which
result in heavy human casualties. However it does little to halt the more
diffuse violence, which leads to “tactical” attacks against Israeli settlers
and soldiers in the Territories. The Palestinians will try to gain most
of the territories and signs of independence and sovereignty through resistance
and struggle.
<p>General Amos Malka, the Head of the Intelligence Corps, recently told
the Knesset’s Committee for Security and Foreign Relations that as the
final settlement negotiations continue, Yasser Arafat may make use of “controlled
crisis” to gain his ends in the event of an impasse. The Palestinian Police
do take action following specific incidents, but he said there is no sign
of a strategic decision to uproot the terrorist infrastructure. In addition
the PA is not condemning attacks. According to General Malka the Palestinians
have not renounced the use of violence and terrorism. As for Hamas, Malka
said its military wing is in a “deep crisis” and is aiming to get out of
its situation by carrying out a terror attack (see <i>Haaretz</i>, November
2 and <i>Jerusalem Post</i> November 3, 1999).
<p>On this background, Hamas will probably lower the profile of its terrorist
activity, reorganize its weakened military apparatus, recruit and train
new militants and wait for the<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </font>right
moment to try and strike again at the difficult and complex process of
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
<p>Another option for Hamas would be to transfer part of its military infrastructure
and activity to Southern Lebanon and attack Israel from there. The Palestinian
Islamic Jihad has already adopted this solution. PIJ guerrillas recently
joined Hizballah in fighting against Israeli and South Lebanon Army troops
and two militants were killed in Israeli air strikes recently. Ramadan
Shallah, head of the PIJ, told <i>Al Hayat</i> on November 14, that his
militants were undertaking “a new strategy” to fight Israel from southern
Lebanon, to wage jihad “from any open front with the enemy.”
<p>Although Hamas has indeed stepped-up its presence in Lebanon and enjoys
good relations with Hizballah, the use of Lebanon as the main battleground
against Israel would be a sign of extreme weakness, as it is for the PIJ.
This solution would thus be taken <i>in extremis</i>, in the case that
both the area under Palestinian control and Jordan become forbidden territory
for any Hamas terrorist activity.
<p>It has been shown over the last three years that only an intense endeavor
by all the parties involved in this long and arduous process, plus close
and sincere cooperation between Israel, the PA and Jordan, can defuse the
radical Islamic organizations’ terrorist schemes.
<p>The question remains whether the PA leadership, and more specifically
Chairman Arafat, will understand that terrorism is a two-edge weapon. Its
“controlled” manipulation or the giving of the “green light” to Hamas and
other forces to use violence and terror could eventually backfire and damage
the achievements and hopes of the Palestinian people itself.

<p><b><font size=+1>Hamas Infrastructure Exposed: Jan. 1998 – Aug. 1999</font></b>
<p><b>January 14, 1998</b>: Members of the Hamas were arrested in the Nablus
area (by the Palestinian Authority), Ramallah (by Israel and the PA) and
Bait Lehem (by Israel). In Nablus, Palestinian security officials discovered
a bomb factory in an unoccupied building, which the PA had raided after
a tip from Israel, where they found 700 kilos of explosives. Dozens of
plastic containers full of an unidentified liquid, in addition to 10 plastic
containers containing gas mask kits, and bomb making chemicals such as
acetone, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide. Four Palestinians were arrested.
<p>The interrogation of the suspects arrested in the areas under Israeli
control revealed that they planned suicide bombings in Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem.
In addition, members of the Hamas intended to shoot at and kidnap Israelis
as well as plant car bombs in Jewish settlements. The arrests foiled plans
to stage attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and prevented serious
terrorist activities in the near future.
<p><b>March 30, 1998</b>: Palestinian police uncovered seven large explosive
factories in Gaza, the largest discovered so far. A Palestinian security
official denied initial reports that the factories were connected to Hamas.
More than 1,000 hand grenades, guns, anti-tank missiles and large quantities
of explosives, some of them smuggled from Israel, were discovered in the
factories.
<p><b>March 29, 1998</b>: A Palestinian was killed in a car bomb explosion
in Ramallah, apparently while preparing a bomb for a suicide attack in
Israel. The vehicle had Israeli license plates and had been previously
stolen in Israel. The dead man was Muhi a-din Sharif, the Hamas bomb maker
responsible for the death of a score of Israeli civilians and the wounding
of hundreds more in a series of suicide bombings. The explosion that killed
Sharif occurred in a garage, apparently used by Hamas as an explosives
factory.
<p>Israeli officials have denied any involvement in the death of Muhi a-din
Sharif, while later Hamas accused the PA of his assassination.
<p><b>April 6, 1998</b>: PA security forces have arrested the alleged killers
of Hamas bomb-maker, Muhi a-Din Sharif. The PA claims that the killing
of Muhi a-din Sharif was the result of a power struggle within the organization.
In response, Hamas has accused the Palestinian Authority of “collaboration
with the Zionists” in the murder of Sharif, and the attempt to put the
blame on members of Hamas.
<p><b>April 13, 1998</b>: In an unprecedented move, Palestinian security
forces have arrested a number of key Hamas leaders, among them: Amad Awadallah,
who is suspected of having shot the bomb-maker Sharif; Ibrahim Maqadmeh,
considered Hamas’s senior leader in the territories; Hamas spokesman Abdul
Aziz Rantisi, for violating a signed agreement with the PA not to carry
out any media campaigns following Sharif’s death; Abdallah al Shami, a
leader of the Islamic Jihad organization.
<p><b>June 29, 1998: </b>Israeli security forces arrested five Hamas members
in connection with two attacks on Israeli patrols in the Jenin and Nablus
areas. The attacks took place on May 9 and May 12, when two bombs were
detonated electronically near IDF patrols. The subsequent investigation
revealed that the cell was planning to set off a large bomb in the restaurant
area of the northern town of Afula. The members of the cell were all residents
of the Samarian village of Marka.
<p><b>September 11, 1998</b>: Two Hamas activists, the brothers Adel and
Imad Awadallah, were killed in a clash with Israeli security forces. The
shootout took place at an isolated house just outside the village of Taibeh
near Hebron. The house where the confrontation took place was found to
contain munitions and disguises, leading Israeli security officials to
believe that the two fugitives were on the verge of carrying out a terrorist
attack
<p>The brothers Awadallah were well known to Israeli security. Both were
leading members of ‘Iz al-Din al-Qassam, the military wing of the Hamas.
Adel Awadallah was among Israel’s most wanted men. He was thought to have
been behind a number of terrorist attacks on Israeli civilian targets,
including the suicide bombings in Jerusalem in which 21 Israelis were killed.
His brother Imad was accused by the Palestinian Authority of killing Hamas
bomb-maker Muhi a-din Sharif in an internal feud over use of Hamas funds.
Imad Awadallah escaped from a Palestinian jail on August 15, and was hunted
both by Israel and by the Palestinian Authority.
<p><b>November 30, 1998: T</b>he Palestinian Authority has arrested the
man suspected of planning the November 6 suicide bombing in Jerusalem’s
Mahane Yehuda market. Iyad Hardan, who was arrested at the request of Israel,
is thought to be the commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the
Jenin area. According to Israeli security sources, he sent out two suicide
bombers, Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar and Suleiman Musa Dahayneh to execute
the attack, which resulted in 27 injured and the deaths of the bombers.
Only a malfunction in the explosives charge kept the attack from ending
in more casualties.
<p><b>In January 1999</b>, a Palesmilitary court sentenced two Hamas members
to 15 years of hard labor for preparing explosives for the July and September
1998 suicide bombings that killed 21 Israelis.
<p><b>February 1, 1999: </b>A Palestinian policemen and an eight-year-old
girl were killed in a car chase after Hamas fugitives in Rafiah. The PA
had reportedly been tracking the fugitives since the arrest of several
members of an allied ‘Iz al-din al-Qassam cell. This incident marks the
first time a member of the Palestinian security services was killed in
a clash with Hamas.
<p><b>May 24, 1999</b>: In a crackdown on Hamas activists, Palestinian
police arrested Sa’ed al-Arabeed, a senior member of ‘Iz al-din al-Qassam,
the military wing of Hamas. Al-Arabeed, an aide to fugitive bomb-maker
Mohammed Dief was wanted by both Israeli and Palestinian security services.
He and his assistant Khalil Sakani were arrested in a dawn raid on a Hamas
hideout in Gaza.
<p>Al-Arabeed has been in hiding since 1995, following a series of suicide
bombings in Israel carried out under his direction. He allegedly assisted
Hamas bomb makers Imad Akel and Yihye Ayyash. Suicide bomb attacks planned
by Akel and Ayyash resulted in the deaths of scores of Israeli citizens.
<p><b>August 8, 1999: </b>The Palestinian Security services have detained
several Hamas activists, in what it called “preventative” measures, after
the release of renewed calls for terrorism against Israel by Hamas.
<p>Among the detained was Abdelaziz Rantisi and Ahmed Nimr Hamdan. Rantisi
was recently released after serving 15 months in jail. A third man, Ismail
Abu-hanab, was detained in Gaza City on Friday after he gave an interview
to a television station. Palestinian security sources said the arrests
were in reaction to the group’s recent calls for terrorist action against
Israelis.
