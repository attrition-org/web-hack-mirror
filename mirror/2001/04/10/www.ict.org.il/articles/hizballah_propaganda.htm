<p><b>Reuven Paz</b>
<br><b>ICT Academic Director</b>
<p>On March 9<sup>th</sup> the London-based Arabic newspaper <i>Al-Hayyat</i>
reported that Hizballah’s South Lebanese TV station Al-Manar has decided
to start broadcasting via satellite transmission. Muhammad Ra`d, a Shi`ite
member of the Lebanese Parliament and the largest shareholder in Al-Manar
made the announcement following a meeting with the Lebanese Minister of
Transmission.
<p>Al-Manar TV currently dedicates most of its broadcasting to Hizballah
military operations against Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon, broadcasting
from the field and displaying photos of dead Israeli soldiers. The station
also broadcasts the declarations and speeches of Hizballah leaders, primarily
secretary-general Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah.
<p>Naif Krayyim, the executive director of Al-Manar said negotiations were
in progress with several satellite stations, including the Saudi “Arabsat,”
the Egyptian “Nilesat” and “Eutel Sat,” which broadcasts to Europe. He
mentioned that there was a dispute over the religious content of the TV
station, which is regarded as quite extreme, but tended to downplay this
point as an obstacle. He promised that Al-Manar “will not broadcast material
that might raise delicate issues in the Arab World.” He made it clear that
the aim of the satellite transmission is “to present a different picture
of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon and its relationship with the Lebanese
authorities.” He added that Al-Manar was seeking the commercial and advertising
market of the Gulf States following a successful tour to the UAE and Qatar,
where he held talks with potential advertisers.
<p>Al-Manar recently announced that “the station has completed all the
technical preparations and the necessary studios and facilities to start
in transmitting the resistance.”
<p><b>Propaganda via satellite</b>
<br>It should be noted that following the coverage of its operations in
South Lebanon Al-Manar became an important source for foreign news agencies
and TV stations where Hizballah activity is concerned. The movement’s leaders
have often stressed the importance of the station for influencing Israeli
public opinion, as well as the place of propaganda as an offensive weapon.
<p>Hizballah is in fact extremely efficient in its use of propaganda, both
in its struggle against Israel and its internal goals on the Lebanese scene.
This is true not only with regard to its TV station but its websites as
well. This propaganda has a only a minimal affect on Israeli society and
public opinion, which is divided in the case of the Israeli presence in
Southern Lebanon. However, Al-Manar’s transmissions are frequently cited
by the Israeli Media, which often rebroadcasts photos from various Hizballah
operations, and this most likely does have some effect in Israel.
<p><b>The shape of things to come?</b>
<br>If Hizballah is permitted to broadcast by satellite, it will be the
first guerilla/terrorist movement to have such propaganda facilities. The
significance of this lies not only in the precedence set for other organizations,
but in the excellent opportunity thus given to the Iranian revolutionary
Islamic ideologues to distribute their ideas to the Sunni Arab world, primarily
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. Even if in the face of the decline of
the influence of extremist religious trends in Iran itself, the regime
could still continue to distribute its ideas through Hizballah, whose religious
leadership has is as orthodox today as it was in the days of Khomeini.
<p>This should also be a point of concern for the Syrian government. For
if Israel goes ahead with the withdrawal from Lebanon in July 2000, the
result will be among other things the refocusing of Hizballah’s attentions
on the Lebanese internal scene, a situation which will provide an outlet
for the organization’s considerable propaganda talents.
<p>The possibility of Hizballah’s use of satellite broadcast should also
focus the attention of counter-terrorism experts on the connection between
terrorism and the media on one hand, and cyber-terrorism via propaganda,
on the other. Above all, the issue highlights yet another area in which
international counter-terrorist cooperation is long overdue.
