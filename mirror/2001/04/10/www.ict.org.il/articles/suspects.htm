<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Three Organizations Claim Responsibility - Real
or Spurious?</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Reuven Paz - ICT Academic Director</B>

<P>Three Islamic Extremist organizations have so far taken responsibility
for the two bombings on Friday August 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 1998, in Nairobi
and Dar al-Salaam. All three are previously unknown names in the Islamic
extremist arena. These names may well be cover names whose purpose is to
mislead investigators. Alternately, they may be aliases used as a consequence
of rivalry between various groups. The three names are “Al-Aqsa Group”
(<I>Jama`at al-Aqsa</I>), The Meccan Group” (<I>Jama`at Makkah</I>), and
“The liberation Army of the Islamic sanctuaries”<I> (Jaysh Tahrir al-Muqaddasat
al-Islamiyyah</I>).

<P>All these claims of responsibility were made via anonymous phone calls
to Arab journalists, characterized by scant detail, so that it is difficult
to identify the exact nature of the organizations or of the callers, beside
the Islamic militant nature.

<P>The phenomenon of taking responsibility under unknown and newly invented
names is a common one. This tactic has been used by various Islamic militant
organizations for some years. It is usually done in order to hide the identity
of the organization responsible for the attack, or due to rivalries between
various groups. Some groups take advantage of the initial confusion right
after an attack in order to provide themselves with publicity or to try
to augment the confusion.

<P>At present, the most probable group or groups to have carried out the
two bombings would seem to be a collaboration of Afghan activists and the
Egyptian <A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18">Islamic Jihad</A>. These
groups have recently united under an umbrella organization called “The
Islamic World Front for the struggle against the Jews and the Crusaders”
<I>(Al-Jabhah al-Islamiyyah al-`Alamiyyah li-Qital al-Yahud wal-Salibiyyin</I>).
The Front was declared in an announcement on February 1998 at a press conference
in Pakistan. The announcement was made jointly by Saudi exiled millionaire
<A HREF="../articles/bin-ladin.htm">Osama bin Ladin</A>, Dr. Ayman Zawahiri, one of
the leaders of the Egyptian Jihad in exile, Rifa`I Ahmad Taha, the leader
of the Egyptian “<A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=12">Al-Gama`ah al-Islamiyyah</A>”,
Munir Hamzah the secretary of the Association of Pakistani Clerics, Fadl
al-Rahman Khalil the leader of “Al-Ansar Movement” in Pakistan, and Sheikh
Abd al-Salam Muhammad Khan the leader of the Jihad Movement of Bangladesh.

<P>The declaration of the establishment of the Islamic Front was accompanied
by two Islamic Decrees (<I>Fatwah</I>) by Bin Ladin and “The Association
of Islamic Clerics in Afghanistan” (<I>Ittihad al-Ulama’ fi Afghanistan</I>),
declaring a religious war against the USA. The war was proclaimed a personal
religious duty upon every Muslim “to kill Americans and their allies, civilians
as well as army men, and steal their money wherever they are.”

<P>The connection between the Liberation Army and the Islamic Front was
also mentioned by Egyptian militant Islamic activists in exile in London,
in an interview with the London-based Saudi newspaper “Al-Hayat”, in August
9<SUP>th</SUP>, 1998.

<P>The possible Egyptian connection to the two bombings may be seen from
another bit of information from “Al-Hayat”. On Wednesday August 5th, 1998,
the Cairo-based reporter Muhammad Salah published the content of a pamphlet
sent to him a day earlier by the Egyptian Jihad, in which the group threatened
to hit American targets. The attacks were meant to avenge the extradition
of four Egyptian Islamists arrested in Albania. The men were arrested on
an American tip, and turned over to the Egyptian authorities, under American
pressure.

<P>It should be noted that Iranian officials have condemned the two bombings,
as has the spokesman of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Other important
Islamist groups like Hamas or Hizballah have so far not reacted to the
bombing.
