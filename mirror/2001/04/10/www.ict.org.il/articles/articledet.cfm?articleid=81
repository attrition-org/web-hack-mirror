<p>
<p>Recently the United States and Britain closed a number of diplomatic
missions in Africa due to “concrete information” that Osama bin Ladin’s
network is planning another attack. The evidence that an attack may be
in the works is said to include intercepted phone conversations in which
bin Ladin’s operatives discussed the transferal of explosives and personnel.
In addition, several embassies have also reportedly been under observation
by unknown elements.
<p>Bin Ladin’s televised interview on Qatar’s al-Jazeera satellite would
also seem to fit the pattern. In the past bin Ladin has been particularly
outspoken just before attempting a terrorist operation.
<p>The timing of these events is interesting, in that bin Ladin’s network
has recently suffered a series of severe setbacks. With his back to the
wall, bin Ladin may be more motivated than ever to perpetrate an attack.
<p><b>The “Returnees from Albania”</b>
<br>On 18 April 1999, one of the largest anti-terrorism trials in recent
memory wound to a close in Egypt. The trial involved 107 Islamic fundamentalists,
63 of whom were tried <i>in absentia</i>. Most of the accused belonged
to the Egyptian al-Jihad group, while the most notorious had ties to Osama
bin Ladin’s al-Qaidah organization. Among the suspects was one of the leaders
of the Gama’a al-Islamiyah. The court sentenced several senior members
of the Jihad group—including the organization’s leader, Ayman Al-Zawahiri—to
death or to life imprisonment. Al-Zawahiri, who was convicted <i>in absentia,
</i>is a close associate of bin Ladin and one of the founders of the “Islamic
Front for Jihad against the Crusaders and the Jews.”
<p>The proceedings came to be called the “trial of the Albanian returnees,”
due to the fact that twenty of the accused were extradited from Albania
in July of ‘98 in the wake of a foiled attack on an American installation
in Tirana. A number of the others were arrested in various countries during
1998.
<p>The trial, which lasted from February to April ‘99, revealed a wealth
of details about the Egyptian Jihad—the group’s structure, membership,
policies and operational capabilities, as well as its connections with
Osama bin Ladin. The trial was a milestone in the worldwide fight against
fundamentalist terrorism in general, over and above its importance to the
Egyptian campaign against the al Jihad group.
<p><b>A change in policy</b>
<br>In the past the Egyptian Jihad Group carried out attacks against Egyptian
officials. Among the group’s targets: the Chairman of Parliament (1990);
the Ministry of Interior (1993). In 1995 the Jihad orchestrated attacks
outside of Egypt against the Egyptian attach&eacute; in Switzerland and
the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of 15 people.
<p>The past two years there have seen a change in the declared policy of
the al-Jihad group. In addition to its bitter ideological conflict with
the “heretical” Egyptian government, the organization began calling for
attacks against American and Israeli targets. In the eyes of the Jihad
group, these countries are the vanguard of a worldwide campaign to destroy
Islam and its believers, with the help of the current Egyptian government.
<p>This change was the result of, among other things, the Egyptian al-Jihad’s
joining the coalition of Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organizations
led by the Afghan Veterans. The collaboration between the Egyptian organizations
and al-Qaidah played a key role in the formation of Osama bin Ladin’s “Islamic
Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders.”
<p><b>Al-Jihad - One step too far</b>
<br>The first hints of the Jihad’s change in policy vis-a-vis attacks outside
of Egypt were seen in a foiled attack against an American installation
in Albania in June 1998. Members of al-Jihad were also involved in the
bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, which killed
224 people and wounded nearly 2,000.
<p>The interrogation of several of the perpetrators of that attack led
to the arrest of other members of bin Ladin’s network in Germany and in
England. The details revealed by the investigation—together with the lessons
learned from the Egyptian group’s involvement in the terrorist attacks
in New York in ‘93—led to an increased cooperation between the United States
and Egypt in the fight against the “International Islamic Front.”
<p>Egypt, through the good offices of the Americans, gained the cooperation
of a number of other countries, among them: Albania, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,
South Africa, Equador, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
This cooperation resulted in the extradition of members of the Jihad Group
and bin Ladin’s network to Egypt.
<p>Thus, the Egyptian groups’ involvement in terror outside of Egypt brought
about a severe backlash—a worldwide cooperative effort that dealt a significant
blow to bin Ladin’s coalition.
<p>Yet another setback to bin Ladin was the public declaration of a unilateral
cessation of terrorism against the Egyptian government by the exiled leaders
of the Gama’a al-Islamiya, Egypt’s largest terrorist group. This declaration
resulted in a massive release of Gama'a operatives from Egyptian prisons.
From the time of the founding of the International Islamic Front in February
‘98, bin Ladin had assigned the Gama'a al Islamiyya a central operational
position in the religious-military heirarchy of the organization.
<p><b>Summary</b>
<br>Despite the considerable achievements of the Egyptian and American
counter-terrorism efforts, it must be remembered that the fight against
Islamic fundamentalist terror is long and involved, replete with attacks
and counter-attacks. Although the fundamentalists have suffered some serious
setbacks, it’s safe to assume that the last shot has not been fired. The
militant declarations of al-Zawahiri in the wake of his conviction <i>in
absentia</i> in Cairo, as well as Osama bin Ladin’s ceaseless threats only
strengthen this conviction.
<p>The American precautions are an indication of the seriousness with which
they view the threat. This, together with the recent threats made by bin
Ladin and his Egyptian colleagues, and the loss of prestige suffered by
the Islamic Front, would seem to portend a concentrated effort on the part
of bin Ladin's network to execute another round of attacks in the near
future.
