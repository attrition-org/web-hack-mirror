<p>Terrorism in the United States undertaken by fundamentalist Muslims
reveals that an active <i>jihad</i> [sacred war] organization, modeled
after counterparts overseas, has become a dangerous domestic threat. To
combat this threat successfully, Americans need to face it not just with
strength and resolve but also with a proper understanding of their constitutional
liberties: that beliefs may be freely held or articulated does not mean
they are beyond public scrutiny or that they can immunize criminal behavior
undertaken in their name.
<p><b>The Explosion</b>
<br>Tens of thousands of Americans at the World Trade Center complex in
downtown New York City, the site of the heaviest concentration of human
and business capital in the world’s largest financial center, were going
about their usual activities on February 26, 1993, at 12:18 p.m. At that
moment, a crudely manufactured, high-explosive bomb ripped through the
underground parking garage of the complex, resulting in nearly $1 billion
in damage, a thousand people injured, and, most tragically, six Americans—including
a young woman in the last stages of pregnancy—dead.
<p>Despite these losses, Americans were lucky this time. The explosion
was intended to cause much greater damage by bringing down the twin towers.
Had the physics of the explosive force reacted differently with the structure
of the skyscraper, it could have done so. The bombers had hoped to strike
a crippling blow against the economy of the United States. This was not,
it should be noted, a request for further consultations, nor the beginning
of a negotiating process. Rather, it amounted to a declaration of a war
to be waged by the most violent means available—the willing slaughter of
innocent civilians.
<p>Nor was the World Trade Center episode the sole planned act of violence.
Shortly after the bombing, the conspirators sent a letter to <i>The New
York Times</i> in which they proclaimed themselves an army and promised
more bloodshed if the United States did not disengage from the Middle East
and promptly cease all economic, military, and political support of Israel.[1]
Consistent with this threat, other members of the same U.S.-based <i>jihad</i>
organization planned to assault Americans again in June 1993—only this
time, on a far greater scale. The goal of their planned “day of terror”
was the indiscriminate murder of thousands of mostly civilian Americans
by simultaneously bombing the United Nations complex and the Lincoln and
Holland Tunnels (through which hundreds of thousands of commuters travel
each day between New Jersey and New York City). Future plans by the group
included attacks on the FBI’s headquarters in New York City, various U.S.
military installations, political and judicial officials, and foreign heads
of state. Thanks to vigilant law enforcement, and especially its infiltration
of the terrorist organization by an undercover operative, all these plans
were foiled.
<p><b>Fundamentalist Islam and<font size=+1> <i>Jihad</i></font></b>
<br>The bombing of the World Trade Center and the “day of terror” plot
snapped Americans to attention through their unambiguous message: the United
States has real enemies, and they live in our midst. Further, those enemies
include Islamic extremists.
<p>Here I must clarify what I mean. Obviously, I do not equate the religion
of Islam and its billion or so adherents worldwide with acts of terrorism
executed by some radicals acting in the name of what they call Islam. Islam,
an honorable religion with many admirable qualities, fully deserves all
the religious liberty America affords. In contrast, fundamentalist Islam
is not a religion but, as Daniel Pipes puts it, “a radical utopian movement.”[2]
It rejects the secularist wall Americans interpose between church and state,
and it unabashedly repudiates the democratic premise of American political
life—that authority to rule comes from the governed—holding instead that
government must follow divine pronouncements. Most of all, fundamentalist
Islam hates: it hates Jews, Christians, the nonfundamentalist governments
of Muslim countries, and the United States—just about everyone who is not
a fellow fundamentalist.
<p>Fundamentalist Muslims have sent their message to Americans already
for some years. The revolutionary Iranian government held Americans hostage
in 1979-1981, violating every convention of sanctity traditionally accorded
a foreign state’s emissaries. The 1980s saw the slaughter of over two hundred
American Marines at their barracks in Beirut, the bombing of the American
embassy in Kuwait, the killing of American passengers on several airliners,
and the seizure of American hostages in Lebanon.[3]
<p>Those episodes have been driven in no small measure by the fundamentalists’
construction of <i>jihad</i>—a positive obligation Islam imposes on all
Muslims.<i> </i>As Bernard Lewis explains:
<blockquote>Conventionally translated “holy war,” <i>[jihad]</i> has the
literal meaning of striving, more specifically, in the Qur’anic phrase
“striving in the path of God” <i>(fi sabil Allah).</i> Some Muslim theologians,
particularly in more modern times, have interpreted the duty of “striving
in the path of God” in a spiritual and moral sense. The overwhelming majority
of early authorities, however, citing relevant passages in the Qur’an and
in the tradition, discuss <i>jihad</i> in military terms.[4]</blockquote>
Unable completely to bleach out its militaristic component, some apologists
endeavor to render <i>jihad</i> more congenial to contemporary sensibilities
by limning it as a purely defensive mission. Such revisionism is burdened
by two problems. First, what proponents rationalize as justifications for
“defensive” war (for example, any opposition or resistance to the mission
of Islam) do not square with common sense or international law.[5] Secondly,
the defensive interpretation is at odds with both history and core aspirations
of Islam. In truth, <i>jihad</i>—a bedrock tenet of Islamic doctrine and
the animating principle of fundamentalism—is the instantiation of Islam’s
universalistic demand for political hegemony: all the world must adopt
the Muslim religion or submit to the authority of Muslim rule. While Islam
forbids forcible conversion, it aims, through <i>jihad,</i> to remove all
barriers to conversion, including those governments that do not subscribe
to the <i>Shari`a</i> (Islamic sacred law).[6] Thus is <i>jihad</i> the
fillip for a radical, fundamentalist Islam<font color="#FF0000">.</font>
<p><b>The Sheikh</b>
<p><b><i>Ideas</i></b>
<br>For about a quarter century, a blind Egyptian sheikh, `Umar `Abd ar-Rahman
(also known as Omar Abdel Rahman), has been a leader of an international
radical Islamic movement. <i>Jihad</i> is his passion; he calls on his
followers to accept it as every Muslim’s obligation to engage in armed,
violent struggle against the enemies of Islam. “<i>Jihad</i> means do <i>jihad</i>
with the sword, with the cannon, with the grenades, and with the missile.
This is <i>jihad</i>. <i>Jihad</i> against God’s enemies for God’s cause
and His word.”[7] The author of an indignant and often logorrheic tome
on <i>jihad</i> titled <i>A Word of Truth</i>,[8] `Abd ar-Rahman deems
a perversion the modern revisionist efforts to cast that Islamic obligation
as a peaceful striving for spiritual betterment.
<p>Nor does `Abd ar-Rahman shy from the label “terrorist”:
<blockquote>Why do we fear the word terrorist? If the terrorist is the
person who defends his right, so we are terrorists. And if the terrorist
is the one who struggles for the sake of Allah, then we are terrorists.
We . . . have been ordered with terrorism because we must prepare what
power we can to terrorize the enemy of Allah. The Qur’an [calls on us]
“to strike terror,” therefore we don’t fear to be described as “terrorists.”
. . . Let them say what they wish to say. They may say, “he is a terrorist,”
“he uses violence,” “he uses force.” Let them say that. We are ordered
to prepare whatever we can of power to terrorize the enemies of Islam.[9]</blockquote>
`Abd ar-Rahman schooled his followers that the United Stis the primary
enemy of Islam, the one responsible for the unhappy condition of the Muslim
world: “Every conspiracy against Islam, every scheming against Islaand
the Muslims—its source is America.”[10] America is the power behind Israel,
behind Egypt’s President Husni Mubarak, and behind Muslims’ having to live
in (as he portrays it) a state of humiliation and surrender.
<p>Of course, `Abd ar-Rahman’s views are seen as abhorrent by the vast
majority of Muslims. Yet, as Lewis notes, divergences among Muslims in
the interpretation of Islam are not easily labelled “heterodox” or “heretical,”
for such notions are Christian ones that have “little or no relevance to
the history of Islam, which has no synods, churches, or councils to define
orthodoxy, and therefore none to define and condemn departures from orthodoxy.”[11]
The absence of such intermediate institutions, which in other religions
perform the valuable function of authoritatively condemning radical interpretations
and behavior—such as `Abd ar-Rahman’s construction of <i>jihad</i>—makesit
difficult to rein in behavior sprung from a tenet run amok.
<p><b><i>Strategy</i></b>
<br>Paradoxically, Sheikh `Abd ar-Rahman also sees America as lacking in
character and will, and therefore as weak. Thus, he assured his acolytes
that five or six small operations against the American military, such as
the bombing of the Marine barracks in 1983, would drive the United States
from the Middle East.[12] The few and ill-equipped fundamentalists have
no hope of overwhelming the American forces; rather, `Abd ar-Rahman believes
they will defeat the Americans through superior will. He urges a battle
of attrition. By fomenting enough fear over time, fundamentalist Muslims
ensure that Americans will find a policy of appeasement irresistibly more
seductive than one of constant vigilance. `Abd ar-Rahman expects that a
combination of Muslim conviction and Western weakness will bring Islam
its ultimate triumph. He counsels patience; operatives should lie in wait
for opportune moments.
<p><b><i>Jihad</i> in America</b>
<br>Before coming to the United States in 1990, `Abd ar-Rahman led Egypt’s
most militant opposition organization, the “Islamic Group” <i>(al-Jama`a
al-Islamiya).</i> Its members helped forge the conspiracy to murder Egypt’s
President Anwar as-Sadat in October 1981. Although an Egyptian court cleared
`Abd ar-Rahman personally of participation in that murder, he later claimed
credit for it; in tape-recorded statements to his followers (presented
to the jury during his 1995 Federal trial). He boasted that the Islamic
Group “carried out many <i>jihad</i> operations against those tyrants.
The most famous and the most successful operation was fighting the atheist,
the oppressor and the profligate by killing him—Anwar as-Sadat, that is;
and now, it is hoping for another operation, God willing.”[13] Thus, `Abd
ar-Rahman asserted his hope for a repeat by planning to assassinate Sadat’s
successor, Mubarak.[14] He also described his authority to issue <i>fatwa</i>s
(Islamic edicts) against the likes of Sadat and Rabbi Meir Kahane as an
“honor and something to be proud of. We ask God to make us worthy of it,
that we be worthy to issue a <i>fatwa</i> to kill tyrants, oppressors and
infidels.”[15]
<p>`Abd ar-Rahman clearly has a great capacity to inspire young and impoverished
Muslim men, who thrill to his panegyrics of <i>mujahid</i> martyrs and
to his portrait of an afterlife promising riches denied them by the “enemies
of Islam.” Throughout the late 1980s (even before he arrived in this country)
and early 1990s, militants reporting directly to `Abd ar-Rahman (by telephone
or in person) conducted paramilitary training exercises in rural areas
outlying New York City and Philadelphia.
<p>Among these early paladins was El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian national
who lived in New Jersey and worked as an electrician for the State of New
York. Nosair recorded some of his telephone conversations with `Abd ar-Rahman,
including a May 1990 discussion in which the two commiserated about the
growing influx of Jews emigrating to Israel and the difficulties that portended
for destroying the Jewish state.[16] On November 5, 1990, at a Marriott
Hotel in New York City, Nosair attended a speech by Rabbi Meir Kahane,
a staunch promoter of emigration to Israel and founder of the extremist
Jewish Defense League. Nosair shot Kahane at the conclusion of the speech,
killing him, then wounded two others (a seventy-year-old man and a U.S.
postal police officer) who impeded his attempted flight. Investigators
uncovered a wealth of evidence in Nosair’s home and work locker that indicated
the existence of a nascent <i>jihad</i> army. Notes kept by Nosair called
for attacks on the “enemies of Islam” by “destroying the structure of their
civilized pillars such as the touristic infrastructure . . . and their
high world buildings which they are proud of and their statues . . . and
the buildings in which their leaders gather.”[17]
<p>Nosair was incarcerated in Attica State Prison in January 1992 and even
there continued <i>jihad</i> activities, planning a bombing spree that,
as he told a government informant, required `Abd ar-Rahman’s approval.
He also met with Mahmud Abu Halima, an intimate of his and `Abd ar-Rahman’s
and a leader of the paramilitary training who (testimony at the later Federal
trial showed) was complicit in the Kahane plot. Abu Halima helped construct
the World Trade Center bomb, aided by, among others, Muhammad Salama and
Nidal `Ayyad, two other Nosair cronies whom the FBI had photographed at
the 1989 paramilitary training. In the weeks leading up to the explosion,
Salama (then living with Ramzi Yusuf, one of the technical brains behind
the bombing plot) and Abu Halima made trips of sixteen to twenty hours
to call on Nosair in prison. Also at that same critical time, telephone
records link Salama, Yusuf, Abu Halima, and Nosair’s cousin and lieutenant
Ibrahim El-Gabrowny to `Abd ar-Rahman, as well as to each other.
<p>On January 16, 1993, `Abd ar-Rahman gave a speech in Brooklyn forecasting
the carnage that was soon to follow. America, he railed, is the foremost
enemy of Islam, and “we must be terrorists and we must terrorize the enemies
of Islam and frighten them and disturb them and shake the earth under their
feet.”[18] Just over a month later, `Abd ar-Rahman’s <i>jihad</i> organization
bombed the World Trade Center.
<p>In early March 1993, a few weeks after the bombing, Abu Halima was arrested
in Egypt, arousing suspicions among `Abd ar-Rahman and his followers: clearly,
their group had been penetrated by a government informant. In the days
and weeks after the explosion, `Abd ar-Rahman busied himself, sometimes
on tape, with trying to determine the identity of the informant. Yet, at
that same critical time, `Abd ar-Rahman made a number of media appearances,
including some broadcast on national television, in which he staunchly
denied knowing both Nosair (whom he had known for years and with whom he
had discussed paramilitary training on tape in 1990) and Abu Halima—the
confidant who had helped him settle in America in 1990, had been his chauffeur,
had shared a bank account with him, and for whose traitor he was covertly
searching.[19]
<p>`Abd ar-Rahman speculated that the informant who had betrayed Abu Halima
was Siddiq Ibrahim Siddiq `Ali, a Sudanese national on whom Abu Halima
had relied on for assistance in reckoning explosives prior to the Trade
Center bombing. In fact, Abu Halima had been compromised by another `Abd
ar-Rahman associate, `Abdu Muhammad Hajjaj, who had informed Egyptian authorities
that Abu Halima was in Cairo (having fled there after the bombing). Indeed,
in the weeks after Abu Halima’s arrest, Siddiq `Ali, acting on `Abd ar-Rahman’s
standing orders, had plotted to murder President Mubarak during a scheduled
visit to New York in late March 1993—a plot that was foiled precisely because
Siddiq `Ali recruited his ersatz friend Hajjaj, who promptly passed along
that information too to the Egyptian government.
<p>Ultimately, `Aar-Rahman was satisfied with Siddiq `Ali’s credentials
and sanctioned his plans for a “day of terror.”[20] Flanked by Siddiq `Ali
as his translator, `Abd ar-Rahman in June 1993 publicly warned Americans
that they would be made to pay a terrible price for supporting Mubarak.[21]
Days later, Siddiq `and his mostly Sudanese recruits were arrested <i>in
flagrante delicto</i> manufacturing bombs to be deployed at New York City
landmarks. `Abd ar-Rahman was arrested on immigration charges in late June
and, in late August, was indicted with Nosair, El-Gabrowny, Siddiq `Ali,
and several others for, <i>inter alia</i>, conspiring to conduct a war
of urban terrorism against the United States, in violation of the seditious
conspiracy law.[22]
<p>Three trials then took place. The first took seven months and ended
with the convictions of four men—Abu Halima, Salama, Nidal `Ayyad and Ahmad
Ajjaj—in March 1994 of bombing the World Trade Center and related charges,
for which each received a 240-year sentence. The second took most of 1995
and ended with `Abd ar-Rahman and others convicted for the planned “day
of terror.” The third lasted several months in 1996; Ramzi Yusuf, the fugitive
who was arrested in Pakistan in February 1995, was convicted (with two
others) on charges arising out of a plot to bomb U.S. commercial airliners.
As of this writing, Yusuf awaits sentencing on that conviction, as well
as trial for his role in the World Trade Center bombing.
<p><b>Prosecuting the Sheikh</b>
<br>My prosecution team handled the trial against `Abd ar-Rahman and his
eleven codefendants. We brought familiar Federal charges against them (under
the general conspiracy, bombing, and anti-racketeering statutes)[23] to
meet specific acts of brutality: the planned bombing spree against New
York City landmarks, the World Trade Center bombing, the murder of Meir
Kahane, the conspiracy to murder Husni Mubarak, and the rest of this breathtakingly
ambitious blueprint of terror. What made the prosecution unique, however,
was our stratagem to focus on the <i>jihad</i> organization behind the
individuals carrying out this program: all the defendants were charged
under the seditious conspiracy statute, which criminalizes agreements to
wage war against the United States and to oppose government authority by
force.[24]
<p>Though firmly established in the law, this statute is a product of the
post-Civil War era and is rarely used. Its use here generated near hysteria
from some academics, who pilloried the case as an ominous anachronism brought
by reactionaries bent on imperilling the freedom to express political dissent.[25]
Such fears, however, were ill-conceived. Seditious conspiracy prosecutions
are unusual, and no doubt will continue to be so, for the simple reason
that it remains fortunately rare that a group conspires to make war on
the United States. Nevertheless, when strong evidence of such a conspiracy
exists, the mere happenstance that such cases are rare must not prevent
them from being brought.
<p>The concern over the prosecution’s portents for religious and political
freedoms also betrayed arrant misapprehension about the facts of the case.
`Abd ar-Rahman, although a religious leader, conducted himself in many
ways like a common criminal. Much like an everyday drug kingpin, he tried
to ferret out informants and engaged in John Gotti-esque braggadocio about
his authority to issue death warrants for the likes of Sadat and Kahane.[26]
He issued precisely the types of naked criminal commands (to murder Mubarak)
and tactical advice (that it would be better to bomb the U.S. army than
the United Nations) that are common fodder for prosecuting organized crime
leaders.
<p>So why all the fuss in his case? Because the sheikh cleverly employed
two of the strait-jacketing taboos of our day, religion and politics, often
(but by no means always) swaddling his directives in allusions to the Qur`an
and polemics against the American and Egyptian governments. Thus, although
his rhetoric and behavior were plainly criminal, and often racist and crass,
he derived cover from our modern obsession with political correctness,
which causes the mere utterance of things religious and political to supplant
rationality with catalepsy.
<p>Neither our veneration of robust political dissent nor the nimbus of
religion need dull the edge of reason. Those who violate the law are nearly
always motivated by something, whether religious principle, greed, the
lust for power, or some other drive. Although those forces naturally become
part of the trial evidence (since it is the government’s burden to prove
that the defendant <i>intended</i> to commit the crimes charged), our prosecutions
target the crimes, not their impetus. Obviously, government cannot refrain
from its mission to secure the governed merely because some will say its
enforcement machinery is moved by animus against the criminal’s motivation
(for example, that he happens to be a fundamentalist Muslim) rather than
his violations of law (the bombings he committed).
<p>Moreover, in the public debate about religious liberty, reverence does
not preclude realism. It is no disrespect to Islam to express forthright
concern about principles such as <i>jihad</i> (which certainly causes plenty
of discord among Muslims themselves) or the lack of church-state demarcation
and how they will assimilate in modern America. Healthy debate does not
condemn or demonize a religious tradition; it fosters accommodations based
on reason rather than demagoguery. Realism is an even more paramount requirement
when we move from public debate to matters of public security. Government
cannot abdicate its responsibility to prevent crimes whenever brutality
is camouflaged in the argot of religious tenets. Fair and effective law
enforcement requires clarity about what is and is not licit behavior: what
merits sanctity from government intrusion (a believer’s acceptance of doctrine)
and what does not (brutality committed under the cloak of doctrine).
<p>As is the case with all faiths, our constitutional principles pay due
deference to Islam, but they neither inoculate its elements from scrutiny
nor shield those who commit terrorism while waiving its banner. America’s
commitment to religious and intellectual freedom ensures that government
may not impede a believer from accepting <i>jihad</i> (or, for that matter,
any other idea), but it provides no seal of approval. Nor can it sensibly
deter the commonsense observation that ideas, while free, are often pernicious—and
the wider the berth given a pernicious notion, the more easily it evolves
into dangerous, often criminal behavior.
<p>Moreover, all speech does not have equivalent constitutional value,
and there simply is no constitutional right to champion violence. Whether
pregnant with religious overtones or not, neither words intended to incite
violence nor speech that is the “very vehicle of crime itself” have ever
warranted First Amendment protection.[27] Further, the core ideal of the
First Amendment is the content of thought; the mode by which thought is
expressed has never been beyond regulation. Beliefs, worthy or despicable,
may not be conveyed through brutality.
<p><b>U.S. Policy</b>
<br>Until now, notwithstanding the atrocities at the World Trade Center
and the Federal building in Oklahoma City, terrorists in the United States
for the most part have been stopped before committing their crimes. Law
enforcement has demonstrated strength and constancy of purpose in identifying
and prosecuting radicals committed to violence. But these preventive measures
will be inadequate to ensure domestic tranquility unless the rest of the
country comes to grips with the threats and their remedies. The operation
on these shores of an active terrorist organization presents a stern test
for the American people and their government. It calls on their icapacity
to recognize what is happening in their midst and makes grave demands on
their character. In this context, five points bear noting.
<p><b><i>Investigators must have the tools to combat terrorism</i>.</b>
That means not only adopting untested measures like tagents in explosive
materials (a recent Justice Department initiative) but also relying on
conventional techniques, such as infiltrating suspected organizations with
undercover operatives. Unfortunately, this investigative tool is the target
of frequent attack. The informant who was used to great advantage against
Sheikh `Abd ar-Rahman’s <i>jihad</i> organization, `Imad Salim, was vilified
by a relentless publicity campaign choreographed under the banner of civil
liberties (abetted by an often breathtakingly uncritical media). To authentic
civil libertarians, terrorism’s penchant to undermine societal order is
the true threat. As Edmund Burke long ago observed, liberty is that which
“not only exists along with order and virtue, but which cannot exist at
all without them.”[28]
<p><b><i>All ideas are legal, but not all actions</i>.</b> The government
has no business invading the sanctum of a believer’s private thoughts;
a person is always free to hate America, and to criticize its record in
the harshest terms. But Americans cannot retreat into tongue-tied appeasement
as soon as a terrorist throws the cloak of religion over his naked aggression.
A proud tradition of religious and intellectual freedom cannot be turned
against the United States and used as a weapon to destroy its resolve in
the face of unambiguous acts of war—acts undertaken by enemies who, had
they the opportunity, would remove those very same freedoms.
<p><b><i>Appeasement does not work</i>. </b>Fundamentalist Muslims hate
the United States and deem themselves at war with it. Worse, theirs is
a permanent hostility, one that cannot be altered by clever diplomacy or
rhetorical flourishes. They despise Americans for who they are and what
they believe. They reject basic American principles—that the authority
to rule comes from the people, who freely may choose their ideals and beliefs.
This being the case, the terrorists’ enmity cannot be reversed without
changing the basic character of what the United States is, without destroying
all that is worth preserving.
<p><b><i>Words may not deter but actions do</i>. </b>Terrorists need to
feel American determination to pursue, punish, and contain them, so that
their efforts never bear fruit and their brutality brings with it a cost
they cannot pay. I believe their resolve will bend in the face of strength.
<p><b><i>Americans need to be consistent in the international arena</i>.
</b>A
law-enforcement agency that would allow a criminal to improve his plea
offer through the threat of extortion would sow chaos and likely forfeit
its future ability to enforce the law. No less, a state that rewards rogue
regimes with a place at the negotiating table guarantees that the law of
the jungle, not the law of civilized society, will prevail. The government
that negotiates with terrorist states encourages every terrorist that his
methods work. International peace, like domestic tranquility, is a product
of strength and the common knowledge that force will be met with superior
force. This real peace is much to be preferred to “peace processes” that
indulge the fantasy of slowly reasoning with terrorists while the toll
of civilian death grows ever larger.
<p>No one is free to send out a call to arms against the United States
without consequence. When the caller demonstrates the wherewithal to make
good on his threats, a great country need not wait to be ambushed before
acting. The terrorist knows only two responses: strength and constancy;
or weakness and appeasement. Americans must make the correct choice.
