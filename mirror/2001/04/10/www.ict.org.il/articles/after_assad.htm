<p><b><font size=+1>Middle Eastern Terrorism After Assad – Hope for a Change</font></b></center>

<p><b>Ely Karmon</b>
<br><b>ICT Senior Researcher</b>
<p>For three decades Hafez el-Assad was a fierce enemy of not only Israel
but of all who stood in his way towards the creation of Greater Syria and
the role he envisioned for himself in the Arab world. Terror inside and
terrorism abroad were justifiable tools in his quest for dominance.
<p>Assad was the architect of the war of attrition on the water issue and
the main supporter of the Palestinian terrorism that led to the Six-Day
War and the Arab defeat. He was responsible for the death of thousands
of Christians in Lebanon; the assassination of the Druze leader Kamal Jumbalatt
and the Christian leader Bashar Gemayel, which wiped out any meaningful
resistance of the Lebanese leadership to Syrian control; the massacre and
expulsion of thousands of Palestinians and their leader Arafat from northern
Lebanon; and even the killing of scores of Hizballah fighters who tried
to limit Syrian control of their neighborhood in Beirut. The fact that
over 20,000 thousand Syrian Muslim Brothers were killed by his artillery
in the city of Hammah can well testify as to Assad’s ruthlessness.
<p>All, without exception, of the Palestinian groups and organizations
opposed to Arafat and the peace process have headquarters in Syria and
bases in areas under Syrian control in Lebanon.
<p>Assad has for years used terrorism too in his strategy to pressure Turkey
to accede to his claims for more water from his neighbor country. The Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK) has been the tool for obtaining this goal, turning
southeast Turkey into one of the deadliest arenas for terrorist and guerrilla
attacks.
<p><b>Assad’s Legacy</b>
<p>Although Iran is commonly considered the main sponsor of Middle Eastern
terrorism in the 80s and 90s and the staunchest enemy of the peace process
between Arabs and Israel, it could not play such a role without the active
and passive support of Assad. The grooming of the Hizballah as a terrorist
organization, the establishment of the Revolutionary Guards’ training camps
in the Beqa'a’ Valley, the murderous attacks on the US embassy, US Marines
and French peace-keeping forces in Beirut, and more recently the massive
weapons supply to the Hizballah through Syrian territory testify to the
pivotal role Syria has played in Iranian sponsorship of international terrorism.
Not long ago Mustafa Tlass, the Syrian defense minister — who recently
assured Bashar el-Assad of the army’s allegiance to his rule — admitted
that he personally gave the green light to “The Resistance” to bomb the
American and French troops in Beirut in 1983.
<p>Hizballah considers itself — and is seen in the Arab world, as well
as in Israel — as the big winner in the fight against the Israeli presence
in southern Lebanon, an example for the future behavior of the Palestinians
vis-a-vis Israel. But any objective observer could assess that Israel was
compelled to withdraw, not by 400 – 500 Hizballah guerrillas — no real
match for the IDF. Rather the withdrawal came about because of the trepidation
of Israeli political leaders to tackle the real culprit: the Assad regime
and its army, which granted Hizballah practical immunity and vital strategic
depth.
<p>Before Assad’s death most observers and intelligence specialists estimated
that he and Iran would goad Hizballah to continue the guerrilla and terrorist
war of attrition against Israel’s northern border, most probably with the
support of, or under the cover of, disenchanted Palestinian refugees.
<p>After Assad’s death the Hizballah leaders can dream of a more independent
status and a predominant role in the Lebanese and Middle Eastern arena.
It is perhaps significant that Hizballah’s secretary-general Nassrallah
was among the first leaders to be received by the mourning Bashar. His
delegation was received with honors at the funeral and his troops were
the only foreign ones permitted to mourn Assad’s death by marching in the
city of Latakye.
<p><b>What now?</b>
<p>Will Bashar el-Assad and the military pillars of his regime continue
the strategy indicated by the father, as they solemnly promised during
the first days of mourning? Will Bashar continue to use terrorism as a
strategic weapon in order to show that he is not betraying his father’s
legacy, that he is as ruthless and as formidable to his enemies as his
father?
<p>The real legacy left by President Assad should not be forgotten. The
real stake is not the stability of Bashar’s regime but the eradication
of terrorism as a legitimate weapon in Middle Eastern politics. To contribute
to the stability of a regime “a la Hafez el-Assad” means to continue the
oppression of the Syrian people and to perpetuate the instability of the
Middle East. Would it be acceptable today to strive for the stability of
the Khamene’i regime in Iran rather than Khatami’s reforms and the liberalization
of the Iranian people?
<p>The absence from the funeral of most of the world’s political leaders,
including president Putin of Russia, should be a sign to the young Assad
that a new era is dawning, and that what was tolerated for years by the
international community cannot continue. There are steps that Bashar el-Assad
can take to adjust to this new era.
<p>First, Hizballah’s prevalence and radicalism in the Lebanese internal
power balance, with all its negative influence on the other communities
and on the peace process, should be curtailed, by disarming without delay
the only active militia left in the country. Otherwise we will see the
territory now under Hizballah control in Southern Lebanon — what Israeli
commentator Ehud Ya’ari calls “Hizballahstan” — become a new base for Jihad,
both in Palestine and perhaps elsewhere in the Middle East.
<p>Second, Lebanon and Syria should be influenced to put an end to the
Iranian military presence in the Beqa'a’ Valley. The Revolutionary Guards
are not only the supporters of the Hizballah. They are also the agents
of the hard-line circles of the Iranian regime, who may use their the Hizballah
to sabotage president Khatemi’s cautious steps of rapprochement to the
U.S., the West and the peace process through terrorist provocation.
<p>Finally, the new leadership in Syria should be made to understand, through
the statements and actions of Israeli and world leaders that its full acceptance
in the new Middle East is not without price. If Syria aspires to stabilize
the regime, to improve its economy, to enhance its relations with the outside
world — and if it genuinely intends to resume the peace talks — it must
abandon once and for all the use of terrorism in advancing its strategic
and political goals.
