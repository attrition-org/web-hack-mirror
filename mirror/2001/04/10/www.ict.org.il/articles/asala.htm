<p>In January 1975, ASALA (Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia),
hitherto an unknown organization, bombed the World Council of Churches
(WCC) office in Beirut and since then had placed itself within both the
Middle Eastern terrorist complex and the International terrorist system.
During the period of time between 1975 and 1982 dozens of Turkish diplomats
and a lot of installations of Turkish and Western interests had been the
target of Asala’s militant activities.
<p>Asala’s activities were actually carried out by a small group of people,
but due to their spectacular nature they were very successful in bringing
the issue of the Armenian genocide to the forefront of international awareness.The
public opinion Asala appealed to was often that of the world at large rather
than that of the worldwide Armenian Community.
<p>The roots of Asala can be traced in the accumulation of frustration
resulted from the international community’s lack of interest in the Armenian
genocide committed by the Turks in the course of World war I, and a tendency
among western pro-Turkish scholars to deny the genocide as a historical
fact. Furthermore, during the mid-1970’s the militant milieu surrounding
the civil war in Lebanon inspired and stimulated young Armenians to resort
to political terrorism.
<p>The pro-Asala Popular Movements started producing their own publications
with an increasingly revolutionary and political content. These supporter
groups, like the Lebanon-based army itself, included a wide spectrum of
political views from nationalists to marxists. Within Asala itself, the
nationalists tended to be preoccupied with military actions more or less
for their own sake. Others in the Asala leadership, however, felt the need
for a coherent political program, which would provide an overall strategy
to guide their actions. These found common cause with Popular Movements
and also drew strength from their links with other militant groups including
PLO.
<p>At the end of 1981 Asala published an eight-point political program
which it described as “the political line that the Popular Movement for
Asala will support.” This was the result of long discussions with leaders
of the Popular Movements, with a view to eventually forming a united organization,
and was clearly a compromise between the views of the marxists and the
nationalists.
<p>In this Asala identified its enemies as “Turkish Imperialism” backed
by “local reaction” and “international imperialism.” “Revolutionary violence”
was the “principal means” to achieve the liberation of Armenian territories.
Asala supported those who “reject the authority of the oppressing classes”
and will work to “strengthen and expand” coalitions within the “international
revolutionary system.” Asala called for transformation of Soviet Armenia
into a revolutionary base for “the long people’s war.”
<p>In addition to focusing world attention on the Armenian genocide, Asala
had given hope to the younger Armenian generation, galvanisingthem into
activity either directly or as political supporters of the Armyworking
for the defence and release of activists arrested in Europe and the US.
The traditional Armenian parties in diaspora like the well known Tashnak
were forced to set up guerilla groups of their own, like the Justice Commandos
for Armenian Genocide and the Armenian Revolutionary Army, in order to
stop their youth from flocking to Asala.
<p>The fundamental difference between the Justice Commandos and Asala lies
in their political aims, with the former stopping at international recognition
of the Armenian genocide. Asala, on the other hand, came to be seen as
the basis for a widespread Armenian liberation movement.
<p>Everything changed with Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the
subsequent expulsion of the PLO and most of Asala from Beirut. Asala’s
isolation from its supporter groups and its political allies, who were
preoccupied with other matters during this period, had a devastating effect
on its activities.
<p>After the expulsion from Beirut Asala transfered many of its activities
in Syria. With the military wing in control, it formed a working relationship
with the anti-PLO Palestinian radical Abu Nidal. This would explain the
dramatic cooling in PLO-Asala relations at the end of 1982. Indeed, the
PLO was said to have begun working against Asala, and when Fatah leader
Abu-Iyad (Salah Khalaf) visited France in December 1982 he gave the French
security servises details of Asala activists, including photographs.
<p>Discovery of the Abu-Nidal connection was another factor in the total
disillusion of the Armenian organizations with Asala in the wake of Beirut.
In April, 1983 the Armenian National Movement (France) joined the Popular
Movements in the UK and the USA to form a new organization, the Democratic
Front.
<p>Asala’s terrorism had arguably had a greater ideological content and
had been oriented towards discrediting the official Turkish thesis about
the Armenian Genocide and persuading the international public opinion that
the Turkish State has no right to rule over Turkish Armenia.
<p>The establishment of Asala was a belated reaction to the Genocide the
Armenian people underwent by the Turks, and an indirect result of the tranformation of Beirut into the terrorist capital during the 1970’s.
<p>Asala’s activities never had the possibility to bring about a new state
of affairs which Armenians would like more. Undeniably, in short perspective,
Asala’s activities revived the Armenian question, and here lies the main
of its achievements, but in long perspective, it deeply divided the Armenian
Diaspora and offered an opportunity to the Turkish state to divert the
international attention by victimizing herself.
