<p>On October 1,1997, Mrs.Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State,
notified to the US Congress a list of 30 international terrorist organisations
which the US Government had decided to bring under the purview of the Anti-Terrorism
and Effective Death Penalty Act, 1996, which makes it an offence for any
citizen or resident of the US to provide funds or other assistance to such
organisations.&nbsp; The Act also empowers the US Administration to deny
visas to members of such organisations and prohibits their representatives
from operating from US territory.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Harkat-ul-Ansar (HUA) of Pakistan, one of the organisations so
notified, was started in central Punjab in Pakistan in the early 1980s
by certain religious elements under the name the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM)
with headquarters at Raiwind in Punjab, where it holds its annual conferences.&nbsp;
After the US notification, the HUA has reverted back to its original name
of HUM and, hence, it will hereafter be referred to as HUM.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Initially, its objective was stated to be to organise humanitarian
relief for the Afghan refugees in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP)
of Pakistan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It is a Sunni organisation, closer to the Deoband school of thought
and to Wahabism.&nbsp; Like the Markaz Dawa Al Irshad, it holds the sufi
tradition of tolerance of other religions and the importance of the teacher
(guru)-taught (sishya) relationship as the corrupting influence of Hinduism
on Islam.&nbsp; Like the Markaz and the Taliban, it also holds that the
woman’s position is at home and denounces pluralist, parliamentary democracy
and equal rights for women as the corrupting influence of the West on Islamic
societies.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It draws its volunteers from the Tabligi Jamaat (TJ), which ostensibly
carries on missionary and charitable work amongst Muslims, not only in
Pakistan, but also in other countries.&nbsp; Amongst prominent personalities
of Pakistan who had been closely associated with the TJ are Mohammad Rafique
Tarar, presently President of Pakistan, and Lt.Gen. (retd) Javed Nasir,
who was the Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during
Nawaz Sharif’s first tenure as Prime Minister and who is presently intelligence
adviser to Sharif.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Even while in service, Lt.Gen.Nasir was closely associated with the
TJ and he had to be removed by the Government as DG, ISI, in 1993 when
the Clinton Administration placed Pakistan on the so-called watch-list
of suspected state sponsors of international terrorism.&nbsp; As a condition
for removing Pakistan’s name from the list, the US demanded the removal
from the ISI of Lt.Gen.Nasir and a number of other officers&nbsp; who had
reportedly been identified by the Central Intelligence Agency&nbsp; (CIA)
as assisting terrorist groups in India, Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>A few months after its formation, the HUM decided to send volunteers
into Afghanistan for assisting the Afghan Mujahideen groups.&nbsp; Initially,
the recruitment was done in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK).&nbsp;
The HUM was estimated to have recruited about 5,000 volunteers and sent
them into Afghanistan. The money came from Pakistan, Egypt and&nbsp; Saudi
Arabia (Osama bin Laden was an important contributor), the arms and ammunition
from the CIA through the ISI and the training was given by the Pakistan
army.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Subsequently, the HUM recruited volunteers from the Muslim communities
in other countries too. About 6,000 volunteers were thus recruited from
Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Jammu &amp; Kashmir of India,
Bangladesh, Myanmar and the Philippines.&nbsp; The CIA, which was aware
of this recruitment, closed its eyes to it since the HUM’s activities served
the US purpose of bringing about the defeat of Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The initial batch of HUM volunteers was trained in the use of arms
and ammunition and explosives in training camps in the Paktia province
of Afghanistan run by Jalaluddin Haqqani, the leader of the Hezb Islami
(Khalis) Afghan Mujahideen group. Haqqani has since joined the Taliban.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Subsequently, the HUM set up its own training camps in Afghan territory
just across Miran Shah in the NWFP.&nbsp; Some of the best fighters of
the Afghan war came from the HUM training camps.&nbsp; Impressed by their
motivation and prowess, the CIA issued Stinger missiles to them and trained
them in their use for bringing down Soviet planes and helicopters.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>After the collapse of the Najibullah Government in April 1992, the
CIA wanted the HUM and other Mujahideen groups to return the unused Stinger
missiles for which it offered handsome payments. It also asked the ISI
to pressurise these groups to return the unused missiles. They refused
and Lt.Gen.Nasir allegedly did not co-operate with the CIA in getting them
back.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This was one of the reasons for the CIA’s anger against him and against
the HUM.
<br>It demanded and obtained&nbsp; in 1993 the removal of Lt.Gen.Nasir
and in August, 1998, when the Cruise missiles attacked the suspected infrastructure
of bin Laden in Afghanistan, the HUM training camps came in for focussed
attack, apparently to teach the HUM leaders a lesson for double-crossing
the CIA by not returning the unused Stinger missiles.&nbsp; The HUM was
the largest recipient of these missiles before 1992.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>After the Afghan Mujahideen captured power in Kabul in April 1992,
the HUM converted itself into an international network of fighters for
defending the rights of the Muslims all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
name of the organisation was changed as HUA in 1993 and the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami,
another organisation of Afghan vintage, merged with it.&nbsp; As already
mentioned above, after the US notification of October 1,1997, the HUA has
reverted to its original name of HUM.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>From 1992, the HUM spread its activities to Jammu &amp; Kashmir of
India, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Bosnia, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Myanmar and
the Philippines.&nbsp; In an interview to the “News”, a daily newspaper
of Islamabad, on February 13,1995, an unidentified HUM activist, who had
claimed to have fought against the Indian army in Kashmir, said: “ We try
to go wherever our Muslim brothers are terrorised, without any monetary
consideration.&nbsp; Our colleagues went and fought against the oppressors
in Bosnia, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Burma, the Philippines and, of course,
India.&nbsp; Although Pakistani members of the Harkat are not participating
directly in anti-government armed resistance in Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia
and Jordan, many of the fighters in those countries had remained our colleagues
during the Afghan war and we know one another very well.&nbsp; We are doing
whatever we can to help them install Islamic governments in those states.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The daily further quoted the HUM office-bearer as stating as follows:
“ Separate cells look after the training, operations and funds within the
organisation.&nbsp; A typical Harkat sympathiser first contacts one of
its offices and offers his services for jehad anywhere in the world.&nbsp;
The sympathiser, after the necessary in-house security clearance, is then
sent for a ten-day training programme.&nbsp; Later, he is sent to the relevant
Harkat commander, who arranges weapons and selects routes to transport
the Mujahid to the area of operation to work under a field commander.&nbsp;
Each worker volunteers his services for 40 to 120 days.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>“The Mujahid is told in advance that in case of martyrdom, his body
would not be brought back to Pakistan and he would be buried at the place
of the operation. The Harkat takes full care of the families of the martyrs.
Our brave warriors are buried in Kashmir, Tajikistan, Bosnia, Burma and
the Philippines.&nbsp; Muslims in those countries would never forget these
courageous boys from Pakistan.&nbsp; We always tell those intending to
join us that we are devoted to Islamic jehad and, by joining us, you have
chosen a path that may take you to death.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>HUM&nbsp; office-bearers also claimed that amongst the foreign volunteers
trained by them were 16 Afro-American Muslims from the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They also claimed that since the demolition of the Babri Masjid in India
in December 1992, the HUM had been receiving funds from some members of
the Indian Muslim community in the UK.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The “News” identified Fazlur Rahman Khalil as the head of the HUM.&nbsp;
However, the US State Department’s Counter-Terrorism Division identifies
the leader of the HUM as Maulana Sadaatullah Khan.&nbsp; It is believed
that while Rahman Khalil heads the HUM for the whole of Pakistan, Sadaatullah
Khan heads its POK unit.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The “News” further reported on March 27,1995, as follows: “ Official
investigation has revealed that dozens of Saudis committed to jehad all
over the world have been visiting the military training camps inside Afghanistan.&nbsp;
Sources estimated that at least 2,000 persons, mostly Pakistanis and Arabs
of different nationalities, are currently engaged in military training
in those camps for jehad in Kashmir and elsewhere in the world.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It&nbsp; added: “These sources estimated that since the expulsion of
the Soviet troops from Afghanistan, at least 10,000 Pakistanis belonging
to Islamic parties such as the Jamaat Islami, the HUA, the Markaz Dawa
Al Irshad and the Jamiat Ulema Islam have acquired training in making bombs,
hurling grenades, firing from light and heavy weapons and in laying mines…&nbsp;
The Harkat and all other militant organisations committed to Islamic jehad
all over the world have acknowledged sending their guerillas to Tajikistan,
Bosnia, Chechnya, the Philippines, Burma and Kashmir.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The paper concluded: “The Jamaat Islami, the Harkat and other organisations
have never been challenged by the Government in their campaign to recruit
committed Muslims to commit jehad anywhere in the world. These organisations
are also permitted to collect jehad funds anywhere in the country.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In an investigative report on the activities of the Abu Sayaff&nbsp;
(meaning Sword-bearer) group, which has been fighting for the independence
of the Muslim-inhabited areas of the southern Philippines, the “Far Eastern
Economic Review” of Hong Kong stated as follows on March 9,1995: “The Tabligi
Jamaat movement in the Philippines has registered a phenomenal growth.
Philippine military intelligence sources claim it has as many as 300,000
members in the Muslim areas of Mindanao. A military intelligence document
on Islamic fundamentalism further claims that Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was helped
by Abu Sayaff’s network to move in and out of the Philippines.&nbsp; Military
intelligence sources say that the Abu Sayaff group has bought high-powered
arms&nbsp; and that Pakistani veterans of the war in Afghanistan are helping
to train its fighters.&nbsp; Sayaff’s lieutenants are composed mainly of
Filipino Muslim volunteers, who joined the international Islamic brigade
which fought the Soviets in Afghanistan, the military intelligence document
asserts.”&nbsp; (Note: Ramzi Yousef&nbsp; was extradited from Pakistan
to the US in March 1995 on charges of complicity in the World Trade Centre
bombing and has since been convicted)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Earlier (February 23,1995), the same journal had reported as follows:
“ Since 1985, groups of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), the
armed wing of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), have gained combat
experience in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The MILF has tried to shun publicity as
it quietly built up its forces, but some national media attention came
its way last year with reports that it had smuggled in a large shipment
of high-powered weapons.&nbsp; The Government’s National Intelligence Co-ordinating
Agency reported that the weapons included hundreds of Russian-made rocket-propelled
RPG-2 grenades.&nbsp; Also brought in were six 75mm anti-aircraft guns,
American-made B-40 anti-tank rockets&nbsp; and 81mm mortars."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The report of the US State Department on “Patterns of Global Terrorism”
during 1994, submitted to the US Congress in April,1995, for the first
time took note of&nbsp; the activities of the HUM (HUA) in the following
words: “The HUA raised its visibility (during 1994) by kidnapping two British
citizens (in India) in June. This group has recently carried out a number
of operations against Indian groups and civilian targets in Kashmir.&nbsp;
The HUA captured Lt.Col. Bhupinder Singh in January and demanded that Indian
forces turn over an HUA commander in return for Singh’s release.&nbsp;
When the Indian authorities refused, the militants killed Singh.&nbsp;
In mid-May, HUA militants conducted two attacks in Doda district in which
they stopped buses, forced the passengers off , then singled out individuals
for execution—the last victim was a 14-year-old Muslim boy.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The report added: “The HUA has several thousand armed members located
in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and in the southern Kashmir valley and Doda
regions of India. The HUA uses light and heavy machine guns, assault rifles,
mortars, explosives and rockets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Membership is open to all
who support&nbsp; the HUA’s objectives and are willing to take the group’s
40-day training course.&nbsp; It has a core militant group of about 300,
mostly Pakistanis and Kashmiris, but includes Afghans and Arab veterans&nbsp;
of the Afghan war.&nbsp; The HUA is based in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, but
its members have participated in insurgent and terrorist operations in
Kashmir, Burma, Tajikistan and Bosnia.&nbsp; The HUA’s Burma branch, located
in the Arakans, trains local Muslims in weapons handling and guerilla warfare.&nbsp;
In Tajikistan, HUA members have served with and trained Tajik resistance
elements.&nbsp; The first group of HUA militants entered Bosnia in 1992.&nbsp;
The source and amount of&nbsp; HUA’s military funding are unknown, but
are believed to come from sympathetic Arab countries and wealthy Pakistanis
and Kashmiris.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The State Department’s reports for 1995 and 1996 continued to bring
on record the terrorist activities of the HUA.&nbsp; In addition, they
also took note of the HUA’s links with the so-called Al Faran,&nbsp; which
captured some Western tourists in July,1995, beheaded one of them and has
been silent on the fate of the others since then.&nbsp; One of them managed
to escape.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The report of the State Department for 1995 released in May,1996, said:
“ The HUA has been linked to the Kashmir militant group Al Faran that has
held four Western hostages in Kashmir since July,1995.&nbsp; There is no
evidence that the HUA ordered the kidnapping.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The State Department’s report for 1997 released in April,1998, said
that there continued to be credible reports of official Pakistani support
for the Kashmiri extremist groups such as the HUM.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It added: “ Muslims from around the world, including a large number
of Egyptians, Algerians, Palestinians and Saudis continued to use Afghanistan
as a training ground.&nbsp; The Taliban as well as many other combatants
in the Afghan civil war facilitated the training and the indoctrination
facilities for the non-Afghans in the territories they controlled.&nbsp;
Several Afghan factions also provided logistic support, free passage and
sometimes passports to the members of the various terrorist organisations.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It further said: “These individuals, in turn, were involved in fighting
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Kashmir, the Philippines and
parts of the Middle East.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It is necessary to digress a little here and draw attention to the
difficulties faced by Indian counter-terrorism agencies in the past in
dealing with terrorism in the Punjab, Kashmir, Nagaland and the rest of
India due to the attitude of the Western countries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Some Sikh groups, funded by some members of the Sikh diaspora, took
to terrorism in 1981, with the training and arms assistance given by the
ISI.&nbsp; Till, 1985, no Western Government would take notice of their
acts of terrorism and treat them as terrorist organisations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>But, after some Sikh extremist elements in Canada blew up the Kanishka
aircraft of Air India off the Irish coast in June,1985, killing a large
number of Canadian nationals, the Governments of the UK and Canada started
treating them as terrorist groups. In the same month, the US authorities
uncovered evidence of plans by some Sikh extremists to indulge in acts
of terrorism against Indian visitors in US territory.&nbsp; This induced
a change in the US attitude too towards accepting India’s contention that
these were terrorist groups.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Even thereafter, the continental European countries were disinclined
to treat them as terrorist groups, but their attitude too changed only
after some Sikh extremists kidnapped a Romanian diplomat, Liviu Radu, in
New Delhi in October,1991.&nbsp; One of the arrested suspects stated during
the interrogation that their initial target was a French diplomat, but
since the security outside the French chancery was tight, they kidnapped
a Romanian.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>When the world press did not take much notice of the kidnapping, a
Sikh extremist in the US told his counterpart in Pakistan, who was co-ordinating
the operation, over phone that the world was indifferent because nobody
was bothered about the life of a Romanian.&nbsp; He added that they should
have instead kidnapped an American or a West European.&nbsp; Thereafter,
the&nbsp; continental European countries too started taking action against
these terrorist elements in their territory.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Similarly, Kashmiri terrorist groups, the Markaz and the HUM had been
killing hundreds of innocent Kashmiris and other Indians since 1989, but
the US and other Western governments would not treat them as terrorist
groups till one of the Kashmiri extremist groups attacked some Israeli
tourists in the Valley in 1992 and the HUM kidnapped two British nationals
in 1994.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In the perception of the US and other Western governments, these were
not terrorists so long as they kept killing only Indian nationals, mainly
Hindus, but they became terrorist groups the moment they started killing
Western nationals and Jewish persons.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Terrorism has continued to thrive partly because of this lack of objective
standards in assessing and dealing with it.&nbsp; This lack of objectivity
came to the fore once again last year when President Clinton ordered the
bombing of terrorist camps in Afghanistan in reprisal for the explosions
outside the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, but&nbsp; he cautioned
India against emulating the US example in dealing with the anti-India training
camps in Pakistani territory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>In the US perception, if the US did it, it&nbsp; was in exercise of
its right of&nbsp; active defence against terrorism, but if India did it,
it would be a threat to regional peace and stability.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If Clinton discharged his responsibility to protect American lives
through proactive measures, it was legitimate and in accordance with the
UN Charter, but if L.K.Advani, India’s Home Minister, spoke of his responsibility
to protect Indian lives from terrorism through proactive measures, it was
jingoistic and contrary to the UN Charter. That is American logic.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Reverting to the HUM, on September 8,1995, the Pakistani Customs stopped
a car carrying a consignment of heavy arms and ammunition near Kohat in
the NWFP and arrested its driver and Saifullah Akhtar , an office-bearer
of the POK branch of the HUM.&nbsp; On interrogation, they reportedly told
the Customs authorities that the weapons had been procured by Brig. Mustansar
Billa of the Pakistan army at Darra Adamkhel for supply to the Kashmiri
extremist groups.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Pakistan army then took over the investigation and arrested a group
of 40 army officers and 10 civilians headed by Maj.Gen.Zaheer-ul-Islam
Abbasi, who was previously posted as Military Attache in the Pakistani
High Commission in New Delhi.&nbsp; He was expelled by the Government of
India in 1989 for indulging in espionage.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Pakistani authorities alleged that this group had planned to kill
senior military officers and Mrs.Benazir Bhutto, the then Prime Minister,
seize power and proclaim an Islamic state.&nbsp; They were secretly tried
by a military court and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>M.H.Askari, a well-known columnist, wrote in the “Dawn” of Karachi
of October 18,1995, as follows: “ It is said that the plotters had close
links with the Hizbul Mujahideen and the HUA, which are known for their
involvement in international terrorism.&nbsp; It is also said that the
arrested officers wanted Pakistan to become militarily involved in the
Kashmir freedom struggle.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The “Nation” of October 20,1995, reported that Maj.Gen.Abbasi had close
contacts with the HUM.&nbsp; The “Khabrain” alleged that two of the arrested
officers belonged to a secret agency (implying the ISI) and that one of
them was the staff officer of Lt.Gen.Nasir when he was the DG,ISI.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The “Nation” of November 15,1995, reported as follows: “ Almost all
the arrested officers are followers of the Tabligi Jamaat based in Raiwind.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The “Herald”, the monthly journal of the “Dawn” group of publications,
in its January 1996 issue, identified Saifullah Akhtar, who was travelling
in the vehicle with the arms and ammunition, as the patron of the HUM.&nbsp;
It added that, mysteriously, the Pakistani army authorities decided not
to prosecute him.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Fortunately, the interception of the vehicle by the Customs alerted
the authorities to the plot to seize power and they were able to pre-empt
it.&nbsp; But, one cannot be certain that the authorities had identified
all the sympathisers of the HUM in the military.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Markaz and its Lashkar-e-Toiba, the HUM and the TJ are the non-mainstream
extremist organisations which do not believe in elections and a parliamentary
democracy. They advocate a caliphate and the transfer of nuclear and missile
technologies by Pakistan to other Muslim countries and&nbsp; their eventual
use against India to “liberate” the Muslims of India.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>These irrational organisations were pampered by the late Gen.Zia-ul-Haq
and they still have many sympathisers at various levels of the Pakistan
military.&nbsp; To realise this, one has to only note the number of Pakistani
military officers who, after retirement, gravitate towards these organisations
instead of to the traditional democracy-advocating political parties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If these organisations succeed one day in seizing power, the world
would be faced with the spectre of international terrorist organisations,
with links to the likes of bin Laden, having their finger on Pakistan’s
nuclear trigger.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>On February 17,1998, Abdul Aziz Kamilov, the Foreign Minister of Uzbekistan,
for the first time accused the Markaz, the HUM and the TJ of fomenting
Islamic extremism and violence in Uzbekistan.&nbsp; He revealed that 400
persons from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were undergoing training in arms
and ammunition in the training centres of these organisations located in
the Karachi, Islamabad, Mardan and Peshawar areas.&nbsp; He added that
the matter had been taken up with the Pakistani authorities, who, however,
subsequently denied the presence of any such training camps in Pakistani
territory.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Uzbek authorities have so far refrained from blaming the Pakistani
authorities for the activities of these organisations.&nbsp; They have
been saying that either the Pakistani authorities are not aware of these
activities, or, if they are aware, they are unable to control them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Markaz and its Lashkar and the HUM have become members of the International
Islamic Front for Jihad against the US And Israel whose formation was announced
by bin Laden in May last year.&nbsp; The meeting at which the decision
to form this Front was taken was attended, amongst others, by the following:
<blockquote>&nbsp;(a).Sheikh Taseer Abdullah also known as Abu Hafs Al-Misri
also suspected to be identical with Mohammed Atef, whom the FBI describes
as the military commander of bin Laden and for whose capture it has reportedly
announced a reward of&nbsp; US $ 5 million.&nbsp; He acts as the chief
body guard cum personal secretary cum chief adviser of bin Laden. It is
reported that he came to&nbsp;&nbsp; Afghanistan in 1983 from Egypt where
he was a police officer.&nbsp; He joined the Afghan jehad much before Sheikh
Abdullah Azzam, bin Laden andSheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric presently undergoing imprisonment in the US for his role in the
World Trade Centre bombing of 1993. He accompanied bin Laden to Saudi Arabia
and then Sudan, where he assisted him in running the training camps.&nbsp;
When the Sudanese authorities asked bin Laden to leave in 1996, Sheikh
Taseer accompanied him to Afghanistan.
<p>(b).Dr.Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the Jamatul Jihad of Egypt, who
acts as the interpreter and press spokesman of bin Laden.&nbsp; His grand
father, AbdulWahab, used to be the Egyptian Ambassador to Pakistan.
<p>(c).Mohammad and Abu Asim, sons of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman. They are
both associated with the Al-Gama Al-Islamiyyah of Egypt.
<p>(d). Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the Amir of the Markaz and its Lashkar.
<p>(e). Fazlur Rahman Khalil, the Amir of the HUM.</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<br>Addressing a press conference at Islamabad on August 22,1998, after
the US bombing of the HUM training camps in Afghanistan, Fazlur Rahman
Khalil denied that bin Laden was indulging in terrorism and accused the
US of killing 50 innocent civilians, including 15 Arabs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He said that the camps bombed by the US in Afghan territory had actually
been set up by the CIA during the Afghan war and claimed that these were
being used by the HUM for giving education to the Afghans.&nbsp; He denied
that any training in terrorism was going on in these camps.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He alleged that the Nawaz Sharif Government was privy to the bombing
and said that 40 Cruise missiles had struck three HUM camps in Afghan territory.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He then warned: “ The USA has proved itself to be the world’s biggest
terrorist by carrying out the attacks on Afghanistan and the Sudan and
I want to convey to the US leadership that we will take revenge for the
attack.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The US attacked the following HUM camps:
<blockquote>(a). The Salman Fasi camp situated in Jawah, two kms&nbsp;&nbsp;
inside Afghan territory from the Pakistani border post of Saidgai.&nbsp;
This camp was initially started in the 1980s by the Hizbul Mujahideen of
Kashmir with the help of the&nbsp; Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) of Pakistan.&nbsp;
Angered over the JI’s support to GulbuddinHeckmatyar, the Taliban expelled
the Hizbul Mujahideen from the Afghan territory and handed over the camp
to the HUM, which re-named it as the Hazrat Amir Mawia camp.&nbsp; When
the HUA changed its name as HUM
<br>after the US notification branding the HUA as an international terrorist
organisation, some members of the HUA, having differences with the HUM
Amir, set up a splinter group called the Jamaitul Mujahideen under Mufti
Bashir. They have their own training camp in the same area.
<p>(b).The Khalid bin Waleed camp in the Zhavar area near the Pakistan
border:Seven HUM members, including Abu Huraira, an instructor, were killed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>(c).The Liza camp at Tanai in the Khost area, 40 kms to the West of
the Mawia camp.&nbsp; This was run by another HUM splinter group called
the Harkat Jehad Islami under one Qari Saiful Islam Akhtar.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>(d). Another camp close to the Darwanta hydel power station near Jalalabad.
This camp originally belonged to Heckmatyar’s Hizbe Islami. The Taliban
captured it in September 1996, and handed it over to the HUM.</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<br>Addressing the Karachi Press Club on August 23,1998, Azizur Rahman
Danish, the head of the Sindh branch of the HUM, warned: “The US air strikes
have drawn a clear dividing line between the Muslim Ummah and non-believers
and this is the beginning of a crusade. The USA will be paid back in the
same coin.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Addressing a press conference at Peshawar on August 25, 1998, Fazlur
Rahman Khalil said that nine HUM members died in the US attack on its camps
in the Khost area, of whom five were killed on the spot and the remaining
succumbed to their injuries in Pakistani hospitals.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,
two Tajiks and four Arabs, two of them physically handicapped, were also
killed.&nbsp; According to him, the Cruise missiles destroyed four mosques,
partially damaged another and burnt 200 copies of the Holy Quran kept in
the camps.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He added: “The USA calls Osama a terrorist and President Clinton is
claiming that all terrorist training camps had been destroyed in the air
strikes.&nbsp; Let me tell the Americans that not even one per cent of
the so-called terrorist camps run by Osama have been destroyed.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In another warning to the US on September 1,1998, Fazlur Rahman Khalil
said: “The USA has struck us with Tomahawk Cruise missiles at only two
places, but we will hit back at them everywhere in the world, wherever
we find them.&nbsp; We have started a holy war against the US and they
will hardly find a tree to take shelter beneath it.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Khalid Ahmed, a well-known Pakistani analyst, wrote as follows in the
issue of the “Friday Times”, a Pakistani weekly, for the week from August
28 to September 3,1998: “The national consensus on Kashmir often blinds
Pakistan to the isolationist compulsions that arise from it.&nbsp; Internal
politics has compelled the removal of Heckmatyar’s Hizbe Islami from the
Afghan jehad and his ally Qazi Hussain Ahamad’s&nbsp; Hizbul Mujahideen
from the Kashmir jehad.&nbsp; The vacuum created by their ouster has been
filled exclusively with Deobandi&nbsp; and Wahabi Mujahideen.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>“The Deobandi HUA and the Wahabi Lashkar-e-Toiba are the main outfits
fighting in Kashmir, but their guerilla training is acquired in Afghanistan.
..That the jehad in Kashmir is dependent on the Afghan jehad&nbsp; is hidden
from no one.&nbsp; That it gives a locus standi to India in Afghanistan
is not clear to most Pakistanis.&nbsp; The Pakistani compulsion to wage
the Kashmiri jehad&nbsp; with the help of Deobandi-Wahabi warriors has
allowed anew religious stringency to prevail in Pakistani society.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He added: “In 1996, the Lahore High Court openly favoured the Wahabi
jurisprudence as some of the judges were found to be of&nbsp; Ahle Hadith
persuasion.&nbsp; Prime Ministers and Presidents have been attending Deobandi
congregations to demonstrate their new faith.&nbsp; Violent sectarianism
is the offshoot of this social change.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In an editorial in the issue for the week from August 14 to 20, 1998,
the same journal warned: “ Pakistan is gradually falling under the puritanical
faith of Deobandi-Wahabi forces that are allied to the Taliban.&nbsp; In
the past two years, for example, Pakistani judges are increasingly falling
prey to Islamic extremism….The Pakistani state will become hostage to the
Taliban Deobandi brand of Islam by continuing to give succour to the Jamiat
Ulema Islam, the Sipah-e-Sahaba and the HUM.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In an article in the same issue, Ejaz Haider, another Pakistani analyst,
said: “A recent report brought out the linkage between Deobandi sectarian
organisations in Pakistan&nbsp; and the HUA which has links both with the
Taliban and the JUI.”&nbsp; It said that Imams belonging to these organisations
have been saying in their addresses to their congregations that after consolidating
its hold in Afghanistan, the Taliban would not only “liberate” Kashmir,
but also rid Pakistan of&nbsp; Shias and Brelvi Sunnis.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The HUM has strongly opposed the process for the normalisation of Indo-Pakistani
relations. In a statement before the recent visit of the Indian Prime Minister,
Atal Behari Vajpayee, to Lahore for talks with Nawaz Sharif, Fazlur Rahman
Khalil warned: “More bodies of Indian officials would be sent in coffins
from Kashmir on the days Vajpayee visits Lahore.” He also said that Islam’s
enemity with India was ideological and not just&nbsp;&nbsp; territorial.&nbsp;
He alleged that it was the US which had pressurised the two Prime Ministers
to meet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Markaz and its Lashkar and the HUM are determined to wreck the
normalisation process by stepping up their terrorist activities against
India.
