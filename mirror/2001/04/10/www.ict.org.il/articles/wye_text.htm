RIVER MEMORANDUM</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>The following are
steps to facilitate implementation of the Interim Agreement on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip of September 28, 1995 (the "Interim Agreement") and
other related agreements including the Note for the Record of January 17,
1997 (hereinafter referred to as "the prior agreements") so that the Israeli
and Palestinian sides can more effectively carry out their reciprocal responsibilities,
including those relating to further redeployments and security respectively.
These steps are to be carried out in a parallel phased approach in accordance
with this Memorandum and the attached time line. They are subject to the
relevant terms and conditions of the prior agreements and do not supersede
their other requirements.</FONT></FONT>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana">I. FURTHER
REDEPLOYMENTS</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana">A. Phase One and Two Further
Redeployments</FONT></B>
<UL><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Pursuant to
the Interim Agreement and subsequent agreements, the Israeli side's implementation
of the first and second F.R.D. will consist of the transfer to the Palestinian
side of 13% from Area C as follows:</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>1% to Area (A)</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>12% to Area (B)</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Palestinian
side has informed that it will allocate an area/areas amounting to 3% from
the above Area (B) to be designated as Green Areas and/or Nature Reserves.
The Palestinian side has further informed that they will act according
to the established scientific standards, and that therefore there will
be no changes in the status of these areas, without prejudice to the rights
of the existing inhabitants in these areas including Bedouins; while these
standards do not allow new construction in these areas, existing roads
and buildings may be maintained.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Israeli side
will retain in these Green Areas/Nature Reserves the overriding security
responsibility for the purpose of protecting Israelis and confronting the
threat of terrorism. Activities and movements of the Palestinian Police
forces may be carried out after coordination and confirmation; the Israeli
side will respond to such requests expeditiously.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. As part of the
foregoing implementation of the first and second F.R.D., 14.2% from Area
(B) will become Area (A).</FONT></FONT></UL>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana">B. Third Phase of Further
Redeployments</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to
the terms of the Interim Agreement and of Secretary Christopher's letters
to the two sides of January 17, 1997 relating to the further redeployment
process, there will be a committee to address this question. The United
States will be briefed regularly.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the provisions
on security arrangements of the Interim Agreement, the Palestinian side
agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism,
crime and hostilities directed against the Israeli side, against individuals
falling under the Israeli side's authority and against their property,
just as the Israeli side agreed to take all measures necessary in order
to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the
Palestinian side, against individuals falling under the Palestinian side's
authority and against their property. The two sides also agreed to take
legal measures against offenders within their jurisdiction and to prevent
incitement against each other by any organizations, groups or individuals
within their jurisdiction.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>Both sides recognize
that it is in their vital interests to combat terrorism and fight violence
in accordance with Annex I of the Interim Agreement and the Note for the
Record. They also recognize that the struggle against terror and violence
must be comprehensive in that it deals with terrorists, the terror support
structure, and the environment conducive to the support of terror. It must
be continuous and constant over a long-term, in that there can be no pauses
in the work against terrorists and their structure. It must be cooperative
in that no effort can be fully effective without Israeli-Palestinian cooperation
and the continuous exchange of information, concepts, and actions.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>Pursuant to the
prior agreements, the Palestinian side's implementation of its responsibilities
for security, security cooperation, and other issues will be as detailed

to the bilateral Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, a U.S.-Palestinian
committee will meet biweekly to review the steps being taken to eliminate
terrorists calls and the support structure that plans, finances, supplies
and abets terror. In these meetings, the Palestinian side will inform the
U.S. fully of the actions it has taken to outlaw all organizations (or
wings of organizations, as appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent
character and their support structure and to prevent them from operating
in area under its jurisdiction.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) The Palestinian

committee will meet to review and evaluate information pertinent to the

relevant international practice and pursuant to Article XXII (1) of the
Interim Agreement and the Note for the Record, the Palestinian side will
issue a decree prohibiting all forms of incitement to violence or terror,
and establishing mechanisms for acting systematically against all expressions
or threats of violence or terror. This decree will be comparable to the
existing Israeli legislation which deals with the same subject.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) A U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli
committee will meet on a regular basis to monitor cases of possible incitement
to violence or terror and to make recommendations and reports on how to
prevent such incitement. The Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. sides will each

Committee</FONT></FONT></B>

U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli committee will meet as required and not less than
biweekly to assess current threats, deal with any impediments to effective
security cooperation and coordination and address the steps being taken
to combat terror and terrorist organizations. The committee will also serve
as a forum to address the issue of external support for terror. In these
meetings, the Palestinian side will fully inform the members of the committee
of the results of its investigations concerning terrorist suspects already
in custody and the participants will exchange additional relevant information.
The committee will report regularly to the leaders of the two sides on
the status of cooperation, the results of the meetings and its recommendations.</FONT></FONT></UL>

COMMITTEES AND ECONOMIC ISSUES</FONT></B></FONT></CENTER>

Cooperation Committee.</FONT></FONT>

renew negotiations on Safe Passage immediately. As regards the southern
route, the sides will make best efforts to conclude the agreement within

route, negotiations will continue with the goal of reaching agreement as
soon as possible. Implementation will take place expeditiously thereafter.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana"><FONT SIZE=-1>4. The Israeli
and Palestinian sides acknowledge the great importance of the Port of Gaza
for the development of the Palestinian economy, and the expansion of Palestinian
trade. They commit themselves to proceeding without delay to conclude an
agreement to allow the construction and operation of the port in accordance

and Palestinian sides also will launch a strategic economic dialogue to
enhance their economic relationship. They will establish within the framework
