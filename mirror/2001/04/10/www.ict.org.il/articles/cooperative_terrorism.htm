<br><b><i>A New “Cooperative” Phase</i></b></center>

since Fatah’s first operation against Israel, one of the traditional characteristics
of Palestinian terrorism has been the independence of the various groups,
and the lack of cooperation between them. This independence was part and
parcel of the armed struggle under the umbrella of the PLO. The tradition
was strictly adhered to later on by the Islamist groups: Hamas and the
different factions of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). This pattern
was continued even during the popular uprising (<i>Intifadah</i>) in the
years 1987 to 1993 and afterward—subsequent to the establishment of the
Palestinian Authority (PA)—among the Islamist groups that continued the
armed struggle.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Shift of Center of Gravity to the Territories</b>
<p>There was only one exception to this rule of “non-cooperaton.” This
was a “coalition” of locally organized groups of Palestinians, who carried
out operations using improvised explosives in the 1980’s, prior to the
<i>Intifadah</i>.
During the years 1983 to 1987 such small-scale operations comprised some
40 to 50 percent of all Palestinian terrorist activity in what was then
the occupied territories. Although these attacks caused relatively little
damage, these local groups were a harbinger of things to come.
<p>Encouraged by Fatah headquarters in Jordan and by Khalil al-Wazir Abu
Jihad, who at that time coordinated terrorist operations against Israel
for the PLO and Fatah, the local groups were the precursors of the current
popular uprising. Furthermore, they were accompanied by the building of
what the Palestinians call <i>Shabibah </i>(youth): a civilian infrastructure
that stood at the forefront of the events of the uprising and became an
important element in the building of the Palestinian Authority. Together,
the Shabibah and the Palestinian Authority reflected two of the most important
processes in Palestinian post-1967 history:
<ul>
<li>
The shift of the center of gravity from the “trauma of 1948” to the “trauma
of 1967”—from “the Nakbah humiliation” to the “resistance to the occupation.”
This was accompanied by a consolidation of relatively independent Palestinian
thinking in the Territories, in contrast to the previous dependence on
Arab promises to fight Israel and liberate Palestine. This process was
further reinforced when, in the later half of the 1980’s the Palestinian
Islamic groups, Hamas and the PIJ, joined the armed struggle. (The Palestinian
Islamic Jihad took up arms in October 1986, followed, in January 1988,
by Hamas.) These groups were solely a product of the people of the Territories,
unlike the PLO and the groups comprising it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The gradual decline in the importance of the PLO factions and the Palestinian
refugees in Arab countries, mainly in Lebanon. This decline began to be
felt after the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah’s renunciation
of the armed struggle, followed at a later date, by the other, and later
on other nationalist groups in 1993 and ’94.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>The New Uprising</b>
<p>The new uprising, <i>Intifadat al-Aqsa</i>, can be interpreted as, among
other things, the continuation of the popular Palestinian determination
to do away with the Israeli occupation, with or without, the Arab World.
It can also be seen as part of the Palestinian Authority’s bilateral negotiations
with Israel. There is, at the moment, an unresolved question mark on the
matter of much control Yasir Arafat actually has over his security forces,
or over the largest popular militia in the Palestinian Authority—the Fatah
<i>Tanzim</i>.
Since Arafat’s traditional policy is ambiguity, he will probably prefer
to leave this question open, in order to take advantage of both possible
answers to it, according to the circumstances and developments of the American
and Israeli positions. But, at least according to the assessments of senior
Israeli security officials published in the Israeli press over the last
few weeks, if Arafat were to order a halt to the violence today, it could
take as long as six months for it to actually stop. Six months, in the
Middle East—especially on the Israeli-Palestinian front—is such a long
period, that any small spark can radically change the circumstances. Added
to this, are the upcoming Israeli elections, the growing unrest and frustration
of Israeli right-wing groups—both within Israel proper and in the Israeli
settlements—local reactions of Israeli soldiers, and the changes in the
American Presidency.
<p>It is against this background that we are now seeing a change in the
nature of Palestinian terrorism against Israel—from independent operations
initiated by different groups to cooperative ventures involving members
of the Palestinian security forces, the Fatah <i>Tanzim</i>, and, according
to Israeli officials, even Hamas and PIJ members. According to recent reports,
members of Fatah and the PA security forces carried out about 70% of the
operations of the past four months. But even more interesting, is the growing
cooperation between the old Palestinian groups and Hamas.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hamas in the al-Aqsa events</b>
<p>Hamas has taken an interesting role in the violence between Israel and
the Palestinians. Some observers were surprised by the relatively lower
profile of its participation in the events. The movement has so far launched
fewer terrorist operations against Israeli civilians than expected. Hamas
has encouraged its cadres, at least in the first two months of the uprising,
to take part in the violent events as individuals, rather than as an organized
body. It seems that Hamas preferred to grant the Palestinian Authority
and the Fatah <i>Tanzim</i> the leading role, either deliberately or in
response to pressure from the PA. As long as the PA did not return to the
negotiating table, Hamas could feel a sort of alliance with Fatah. This
allowed them to play a significant role in the joint field command of the
events—what Palestinians call the National-Islamic Committee. Such a phenomenon
did not exist in the first uprising.
<p>The relatively minor role of Hamas in the events so far can be explained
by the fact that the PA—particularly Fatah—has actually been acting according
to some of Hamas’ traditional policies—especially in the use of weapons
and the armed struggle against Israeli forces and settlers. In several
cases, members of the Palestinian security forces even took part in terrorist
operations against Israeli civilians in Israel. Hamas could show both its
own supporters and the wider Palestinian public that the movement’s religious
and political messages have been absorbed by the Palestinian public. As
far as they’re concerned, it was this that pushed the Palestinian Authority
to start the uprising, defending Al-Aqsa, while at the same time gaining
more concessions from Israel. Hamas’ low profile may also be influenced
by Arafat’s wish for the Palestinian Authority and Fatah commanders to
take the leading role in confronting Israel, without the opposition groups
that could endanger them in the future.
<p>But, it would also appear that the role taken by Hamas in the present
uprising is a continuation of the change of its policy in the past two
years. Close observation of the movement’s activity, primarily of Sheikh
Ahmad Yasin’s statements and interviews, reveals that Hamas has gradually
changed its policies, with the Palestinian national interests carrying
increasing weight in the movement’s considerations. It seems that this
change was a result both of it’s own decision and the pressures of the
Palestinian Authority, particularly its security forces.
<p>The result was that the movement changed its terrorist policy with regard
to attacks on Israeli civilians inside the “Green Line,” and gradually
moderated its tone toward Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, as well
as the political solution. From total denial of establishing a small Palestinian
State alongside Israel, they began expressing occasional support for the
idea of a Palestinian State despite the existence of Israel—at least as
a transitional stage, until Israel could be eliminated. In an interview
with the Danish daily <i>Politiken</i> on September 6<sup>th</sup>, Ahmad
Yasin stated: “Arafat may achieve something for the Ppeople. We will never
recognize Israel but we will welcome a Palestinian State on a piece of
liberated land, as a step along the way.” Concerning the cessation of terrorist
attacks inside Israel he said, “conditions for military operations have
become much more difficult due to the cooperation between Israel and the
Palestinian security forces.” In some of his statements and those of other
senior members of Hamas, the central element was the liquidation of the
Israeli occupation rather than the creation of an Islamic state on all
of Palestine.
<p>Hamas’s low profile during recent events may be typical of the movements
affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. They tend to prefer the support
for popular socio-political and religious revolutions, to being seen to
take the leading political role by force. The fact that the Palestinian
Authority—encouraged by popular anger and demands from the local Fatah
leadership of the <i>Tanzim</i>—changed course and took a militant stand
against Israel was very convenient for Hamas’ leadership in the Territories.
This position was assisted also by the weak position of the “external”
and more extremist leadership of the movement, which was expelled last
year from Jordan and lost much of its influence on Hamas ranks in the Territories.
The firm position of the Jordanian authorities, who acted to prevent any
possibility of the shift of Palestinian riots from the territories to their
soil, was also a barrier to militant support for Hamas on the part of the
Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood.
<p>Another element to note here is the PA’s apparent level of self-confidence
in its relationship with Hamas. So far, it seems that the Palestinian Authority
enjoys a great deal of popular support in its fight against Israel, on
the background of what the Palestinians view as growing weakness of the
Israeli society to confront their violence. Cooperation between Hamas and
the <i>Tanzim</i> at this point cannot endanger this support and might
even serve to increase popular support for Fatah.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Forces of Omar al-Mukhtar</b>
<p>An example of the growing cooperation between the Palestinian groups
can be found in the “Forces of Omar al-Mukhtar.” The group appeared for
the first time in April 1998, when, according to the Jordanian <i>Al-Dustur,</i>
it claimed responsibility for an attack on Israeli settlers at Maon, in
the Hebron area on 19 April. The announcements came from Damascus, and
their language was pan-Arabic—the terminology closer to Fatah than to the
Islamists. Later on, the group was regarded by observers as belonging to
the Fatah-Intifadah, under Col. Abu Musa, which split from Fatah in 1983
and joined the pro-Syrian rejectionist Palestinian groups. On 17 January
2000, in a communiqu&eacute; sent to the French news agency in Beirut,
they claimed responsibility for a car bomb explosion in the market of Hadera.
The operation was actually carried out jointly by Hamas and the Palestinian
Islamic Jihad.
<p>During the past four months, since September 28<sup>th</sup>, 2000,
the group has claimed responsibility for dozens of operations in 23 communiqu&eacute;s
published on the website of “The Free Arab Voice,” (<a href="http://www.fav.net/">www.fav.net</a>).
Most of these operations were shootings carried out by members of the Fatah
<i>Tanzim</i>.
On November 20<sup>th</sup>, they claimed responsibility, together with
two other minor groups, for an attack on a school bus near Kfar Darom in
the Gaza Strip. According to <i>Ma’ariv</i> of November 29<sup>th</sup>,
the group issued a pamphlet in East Jerusalem in which it threatened to
kill Palestinians in Jerusalem accused of being Israeli collaborators.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Hamas connection</b>
<p>On its website, Hamas recently published an article from the December
6<sup>th</sup> issue of the daily <i>Al-Khalij</i>, in which the author
claimed that the Forces of Omar al-Mukhtar belonged to Hamas, and not to
Fatah-Intifadah. He explained how and why the movement’s military wing
started to use this name for its operations, rather than the more familiar
name, “Al-Qassam Brigades.”
<p>According to <i>Al-Khalij</i>, well-informed sources confirmed that
these forces have a certain relationship with Hamas, but that they have
no connection of any kind to Fatah-Intifadah. According to the author’s
sources, Iz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, decided
to take precocious security steps in order to mislead the Israeli and the
Palestinian security forces, in the wake of painful strikes by these forces.
The Israeli security forces succeeded in killing several senior Iz al-Din
al-Qassam activists, and the Palestinian security forces managed to arrest
others. These sources reported that in negotiations between the commanders
of Al-Qassam Brigades and the political leadership of Hamas, the Brigades
suggested that the Movement use a different name in its military announcements.
They claimed that by taking<b> </b>responsibility for every operation,
Hamas makes it easier for Israel and the PA to investigate Hamas members,
and to locate those belonging to the Brigades. This results in the arrest
of members of the movement and the discovery of their clandestine activities,
and hence to the discovery of those who carried out operations, who must
go underground or face arrest.
<p>Thus, the Brigades requested that they be allowed to take responsibility
for Hamas military operations under another name, such as the “Forces of
Omar al-Mukhtar.” The political leadership of Hamas did not respond to
this request at the time, but promised to consider it. After a while, the
headquarters of the Brigades announced that it would take what it considered
proper and necessary steps to secure its activity. It began publishing
its announcements under the title, the “Forces of Omar al-Mukhtar.” Neither
the Israeli nor the Palestinian security services managed to uncover any
of those who carried out military operations under this name, which justified
the use of such tactics. The political leadership of Hamas then ratified
this step.
<p>It is unlikely that Hamas would put such an article on its website if
the information were false. On November 27<sup>th</sup>, Hamas published
an Al-Qassam Brigades communiqu&eacute;, hailing the Forces of Omar al-Mukhtar
and praising their role in the events. On January 4<sup>th</sup>, 2001,
the Israeli security forces announced the discovery of PIJ cells in Nablus
and East Jerusalem, led by Sa`d Kharouf, a former member of the Abu Musa
group, and aided by Israeli Arabs. Sa`d Kharouf was killed by Israeli soldiers
a few weeks ago. Since December 2000, Hamas once more returned to the use
of the name, “Qassam Brigades” to take responsibility for its operations.
<p>If all this is true, we can see that the political leadership of Hamas
was in no hurry to respond to the idea of using a different name, which
may be explained by its increased assurance with regard to its relations
with the PA. Hamas may feel confident that it will be given a free hand
for its operations, on the background of its cooperation with the Tanzim.
<p>This example would seem to represent a pattern of cooperation between
the Islamists and the secular nationalists—a pattern that is increasingly
common in what appears to be a new phase in Palestinian terrorism. The
initiative taken by the Fatah <i>Tanzim—</i>with the blessing of the Palestinian
Authority—and the continual violent attacks by <i>Tanzim</i> and members
of the Palestinian security forces serve to encourage such cooperation.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>The nature of the present uprising, led by the Palestinian security
forces and Fatah <i>Tanzim</i>, is a result of the centricity of the PA
and the Palestinians in the territories in the Palestinian struggle. These
circumstances contrast sharply with those of the previous uprising, in
which the power of the PLO and the various Palestinian groups was much
greater. The present situation imposes greater cooperation and a gradual
lessening of the differences between the various groups and movements.
Cooperation on the political level, in the form of the joint National-Islamic
Committee, which directs the popular events, may also push the armed struggle
in the direction of greater cooperation. The mixture of PA security forces,
Fatah militia members, Islamists, and rejectionist groups, together with
inflamed populpassions, has created not only new phase of cooperation,
but also operations of a higher quality. This transition is reminiscent
of the same process in the Lebanese arena. In addition, the Palestinians
have retained the sympathy of international public opinion for their present
struggle, which encourages them to continue with a sense of much greater
unity than they’ve ever achieved.
<p>In such circumstances, there is a possibility that the dynamics of terrorism,
shaped in the present uprising, will last for some time, becoming an obstacle
for any settlement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It may
proof an extremely difficult task to uproot the developing discipline of
“cooperative” operations in the terrorist field.
<p>To the all of the above, we should add several factors that also mark
the growing cooperation:
<ul>
<li>
The liquidation of Palestinians accused of collaboration with Israel, either
by terrorist operations and assassinations by members of the <i>Tanzim</i>,
Hamas, or popular gangs, or by formal executions by the PA. This process
enjoys the support of the vast majority of the Palestinians in the Territories.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The killing of Palestinians suspected of corruption. The most prominent
of these was Hisham al-Makki, the manager of the Palestinian Television
and Radio station in Gaza, and a close ally of Yasir Arafat. In the past
few days the PA showed signs of support for the killing and confiscated
his property, which included several fancy cars and houses in the Territories
and abroad and large bank accounts. The Palestinian public silently supported
the killing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The continuing support of the Palestinian public for Hizballah and articles
in the Palestinian press in favor of the “Lebanonization” of the Palestinian
territories.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The almost total silence of some of the Palestinian groups, such as the
Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Democratic Front
for Liberation of Palestine, the Palestinian Democratic Union (<i>FIDA</i>),
the People Party (the ex-communists), etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The absence of participation of Palestinian groups in Lebanon in attacks
on Israel, which increases the importance of the shift of the center of
gravity to the territories on one hand, and the decline of various Palestinian
groups that were powerful there in the past.</li>
</ul>
The result of all these factors seems to be the further development of
this “cooperative” Palestinian terrorism against Israel in the Palestinian
Territories. The cooperation,&nbsp; supported by the general hatred of
Israel during 33 years of occupation, has only been further brought to
the surface during the past four months of violence. The issue of Jerusalem
adds to these factors an element of unity between the national and Islamic
forces, supported by the vast majority of the Palestinian public. Taken
all together, these factors are the probable basis for recent warnings
by Israeli security officials that the emerging Palestinian state is in
danger of becoming a terrorist state, and a far from pleasant neighbor.
