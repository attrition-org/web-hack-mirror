<CENTER>Survey of Sudan's involvement in Terrorism</CENTER>
</TD>

</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<BR>This survey examines Iranian-Sudanese ties and their implications on
Sudan’s assistance to the terror organizations and the Fundamentalist -
Islamic groups.

<P>The survey has been updated to June 1994, based on open sources only,
and is a continuation of the surveys published by the office of the Adviser
to the Prime Minister on Counter-Terrorism.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Main Points</H3>
The Fundamentalist-Moslem ideology which guides the Sudanese regime, as
well as Iranian assistance and training, have made Sudan a natural base
for the activities of&nbsp; many terror organizations.

<P>There are apparently hundreds of activists in Sudan from the Middle
East and Africa, who receive military training in order to return to their
countries, carry out attacks, and create anarchy with the intention of
taking over their country’s institutions and instituting an Islamic regime.

<P>The Sudanese involvement in terror manifested itself, inter alia, by
involving Iranian activists in the attempted terror attacks in crowded
New York centers in the beginning of 1993.&nbsp; Within this framework,
we must point out that:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
The head of the terror squad which planned the showcase attack in New York,
Sidik Ibrahim Ali, as well as other members of the squad, were Sudanese.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
&nbsp;Several arrested terrorists confessed to their interrogators that
they were trained at Sudanese terrorist camps by Iranian revolutionaries
and Hizballah activists from Lebanon.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
It is also possible that the activists who were arrested were supposed
to receive operational assistance from Sudanese diplomats at the U.N. Building
in New York.</LI>
</UL>
Sudan, as a country bordering Egypt, serves as a convenient base for training
Egyptian terrorists and as an exit base for attacks in Egypt. Interrogation
of Egyptian terrorists returning from Afghanistan revealed that Khartoum
is the main link in the planning stage of terror attacks against Egypt.

<P>Sudan is an important factor in Iran’s strategy and serves as a bridgehead
for the penetration of Iranian Fundamentalism into Africa. Co-operation
between Iran and the regime of Omar el Bashir in Sudan commenced several
years ago.

<P>The military-political involvement of Teheran in Sudan became deeply
entrenched during 1992.&nbsp; This involvement was noticeable in the signing
of military and economic agreements between the two countries and included,
inter alia, military and economic assistance within the framework of rehabilitating
the Sudanese armed forces.

<P>During 1993, Iran transferred arms to Fundamentalist groups in Sudan
via the General Secretary of the Iranian-Sudanese Friendship Association
- Amin Benani.&nbsp; With Benani’s blessing, the Sudanese army was armed
and equipped with the sole purpose of strengthening it to deal with the
rebels in Southern Sudan under the command of John Gering.

<P>The assistance which Sudan gives to the various terror organizations,
as well as its possible involvement in the attempted attacks in the U.S.
in 1993, have caused the U.S. to include Sudan in the list of “countries
supporting terrorism” and, as a result, to impose commercial and economic
sanctions on it. This U.S. decision has encouraged a Sudanese effort to
improve its international image and, at the same time, to bridge its impaired
relations with Egypt and to deny all involvement in terror activity.

<P>It is possible that the assistance given by Sudan to France in the extradition
of Carlos, was intended to score points for the Sudanese in the West and
to help them in removing their name from the list of “countries supporting
terrorism”. A number of publications connect the release of two Iranians
from a French prison at the beginning of 1994 to this affair&nbsp; Yhe
two were jailed for murdering a member of the Iranian Opposition residing
in Switzerland. It is claimed that their release ensured Iran’s tacit assistance
in capturing Carlos in Sudan..

Background</H3>
Sudan borders Egypt and Libya to the north, Ethiopia to the east, Kenya,
Uganda and Zaire to the south and the Central African Republic and Chad
to the west.&nbsp; It has an area of approximately 2.5 million sq.kms.
and a population of 25 million, two thirds of which are Moslems and the
remainder are Christians and Animists who dwell mostly in the south.

<P>Strategically, Sudan controls the shipping routes leading from the Red
Sea to the Gulf&nbsp; of Eilat and the Suez Canal.

<P>Sudan became an independent state in 1956 and considers itself part
of the Arab world, whereas the Christian and Animistic minority population
sees itself as belonging to the black African states bordering Sudan.

<P>Even before Sudan attained its independence, there was very little contact
between the various stratum of its population.&nbsp; The alienation between
the inhabitants of the south and those in the north&nbsp; was due to differences
in religion and economic-social levels. Moreover, the geographical barrier
(the enormous swamps between the south and the north), as well as the differences
in dialect, exaggerated the estrangement.

<P>When Sudan declared its independence, the southerners feared that they
would suffer politically and economically by the Arab Moslem majority taking
over the reins of government. (Against this background, the rebellion of
the soldiers in the south against the government in Khartoum broke out
in the summer of 1955.&nbsp; This bloody rebellion developed into a civil
war which continued for 17 years).

<P>Only in 1972, when autonomy was granted to the south, was a peace agreement
signed between Khartoum and representatives of the southern population.

<P>During the second half of the 1970s, it seemed that all the dissension
had been settled between the south and the north, but later on, signs of
dissatisfaction began to appear (particularly on the part of the southerners
towards Khartoum), against the background of their political-economical-socio
standing in the country.

<P>In the summer of 1977, when President Namiri tried to reconcile with
the exiled Moslem Opposition by means of the Amnesty Law, the exiled Moslems
from the extreme right were enabled to return home (headed by Zadek el-Mahdi).
