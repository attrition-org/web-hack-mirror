<p><center><h2>Will Operation <i>Desert Fox</i> Generate a Wave
of Terrorism against the U.S. and Britain?</h2></center>
<P><b>Ely Karmon</b>
<BR><b>ICT</b>

<p><p><b>Background</b>
<br>The United States government&nbsp; has decided on a series of measures
in order to curtail the possibility that a wave of terrorist attacks could
harm its citizens, embassies and interests around the world, mainly in
the Middle East and Africa, in the wake of the Operation <i>Desert Fox</i>.
<p>According to official American sources, the US embassies and military
installations in the Middle East have received threats, while US intelligence
agencies have received warnings of possible attacks during and in the aftermath
of the strikes against the Iraqi military and industrial infrastructure.
<p>Taking into account the natural desire for revenge on the part of the
Iraqi regime, the anti-American sentiments expressed in many hostile pronouncements
throughout the Arab and Muslim world and the continuous threat represented
by Osama Bin Laden’s Front (<i>al-Qaeda</i>), the cautious American approach
is understandable.
<p>Yet, a closer look at the history of the Iraqi terrorist threat against
the U.S. and the coalition countries during the 1991 Gulf War shows that
the international infrastructure and the operational capabilities at the
disposal of the Iraqi regime are not significant.
<p><b>Threats and terrorist attacks during Operation <i>Desert Storm</i>
(1991)</b>
<br>According to the State Department’s&nbsp; <i>Patterns of Global Terrorism:
1991</i> “the number of international terrorist incidents rose in 1991
as a result of the Persian Gulf war, when terrorists in many regions of
the world attacked targets belonging to the international coalition opposed
to Saddam Hussein. Most of these were minor incidents, resulting only in
property damage. War-related attacks brought the total number of international
terrorist incidents in 1991 to 557, up from 456 in 1990. Fully half of
the incidents in 1991 occurred during January and February, while Operation
<i>Desert
Storm</i> was under way. After the war, however, the number of terrorist
incidents dropped sharply and actually fell below 1990 levels.”
<p>After the invasion of Kuwait Iraq issued repeated exhortations to terrorist
organizations to strike at coalition targets worldwide. Many terrorists
supported Iraq and publicly vowed to launch attacks in the event of war.
However, most of the recorded attacks were sporadic, uncoordinated and
low-level incidents and only a small percentage resulted in deaths or significant
injuries. The threatened massive wave of Middle Eastern terrorism that
Saddam promised did not materialize.
<p>According to the same report, “although many of the Palestinian groups
threatened to conduct terrorist operations against the international coalition
opposing Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait, few such attacks actually occurred.”
Most incidents recorded during the Persian Gulf war were bombing attacks
against commercial property belonging to coalition countries’ firms, mostly
outside the Middle East region. There were no terrorist attacks against
Americans or U.S. interests in Egypt in 1991, despite concerns of such
attacks in support of Operation <i>Desert Shield/Desert Storm</i>.
<p>1991 marked a resurgence of European left-wing terrorist groups, after
several years of inactivity, especially through attacks during the Persian
Gulf war. Four Americans were killed in terrorist attacks in Europe this
year--three were victims of indigenous leftist groups--as compared with
none in 1990.
<p>A considerable number of attacks in Latin America were inspired by the
U.S. role in the Persian Gulf war. Latin American terrorist groups conducted
224 attacks on foreign interests, continuing the upward trend of the past
four years. It should be noted, however, that this figure represents only
a small percentage of the total number of terrorist incidents in the region.
While the Persian Gulf war clearly was a factor in the large number of
attacks in early 1991, 116 international incidents occurred after the end
of Operation <i>Desert Storm</i>.
<p><b>What were the reasons of this surprising situation?</b>
<br>Indeed, the United States, in concert with the international community
responded swiftly and firmly to Iraq and the groups pledging to carry out
terrorist attacks on behalf Iraq. As the U.S. report summed up:
<ul START=1991>
<li>
Iraq and the terrorist groups were warned of the consequences of a resort
to terrorism.</li>

<li>
Coalition countries preemptively expelled more than 200 Iraqi diplomats
and intelligence operatives to reduce the threat posed by Iraq's network
of support.</li>

<li>
Many countries alerted their citizens to the threat posed by Iraqi-sponsored
terrorism and upgraded security at facilities likely to be terrorist targets
such as airports and the airlines of coalition countries.</li>

<li>
Cooperation among law enforcement and intelligence services in many different
nations increased the effectiveness of national counter-terrorist measures
against Iraq.</li>

<li>
The rapidity of the coalition advance into Iraq sealed Iraq's defeat before
operations could be coordinated.</li>
</ul>
<b>What is the threat today?</b>
<br>The United States and Britain have not succeeded in convincing other
powers, such as France and Russia, to join them in the move to clamp down
on Saddam Hussein’s attempts to get rid of the UNSCOM control teams and
go back to the production of weapons of mass destruction. Russia in fact
returned to the “old good days” of the Cold War in order to recover, even
partially, its lost super-power status.
<p>Moreover, most of the Arab countries that participated in the Gulf War
coalition against Iraq remained neutral or condemned the Anglo-American
operation, mainly out of fear of public opinion in their own countries.
<p>From this point of view, Iraq could feel itself stronger and more confident
in its obstinate attitude vis-a-vis the American and British pressure and
military attacks.
<p>But on the terrorist front the picture is much more complex:
<ul START=1991>
<li>
Iraq is today isolated from most of the terrorist organizations active
on the international arena. Even the Islamist terrorist organizations that
support the Iraqi people and territories against what they consider the
foreign infidel and imperialist aggression cannot forget or accept the
oppression of the Shi’ite community and the brutal treatment or assassination
of its religious leaders by Saddam Hussein’s regime.</li>

<li>
The active Palestinian terrorist organizations, including the Islamic ones,
have decided not to use the international arena. Most of them have their
headquarters in Damascus and must take into consideration the Syrian regime’s
interest to keep proper relations with the United States.</li>

<li>
The left-wing terrorist organizations in Europe have practically disappeared
subsequent to their neutralization by security forces and the fall of the
Soviet Empire.</li>

<li>
The same can be said of Latin and Central America, after the setbacks suffered
by the guerrilla and terror organizations in Peru, El Salvador, and Chile.
Only Colombia remains the theater of fierce anti-American guerillas.</li>

<li>
Libya is isolated and ready to negotiate a compromise on the Lockerbie
trial with the United Nations. Even Iran, the main sponsor of international
terrorism during recent years, is today stricken by internal political
turmoil and more cautious in its terrorist policy. Moreover, Iran has no
incentive to help its neighbor and enemy.</li>
</ul>
The only remaining significant threat is presented therefore by the organizations
coalesced around <a href="#note">Osama bin Ladin’s</a> “World Islamic Front
for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,” which proved themselves in the murderous
bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salam in August 1998.
<p>But the Front has also suffered heavy setbacks with the arrest of some
of its operatives and senior militants and their extradition to the U.S.
Some of its Egyptian components seem ready to give up the armed struggle
and to arrive to an understanding with the Egyptian government in order
to obtain the release of their imprisoned comrades. Osama bin Laden himself,
although still under the protection of the Taliban regime, is tracked by
the American intelligence agencies with the assistance of the Pakistani
services.
<p><b>Summary</b>
<br>It seems therefore that the terrorist threat to American and British
targets has not significantly increased.
<p>Osama bin Ladin’s Front will probably try to strike at American targets
worldwide. The other extremist Islamic organizations will have one more
reason to try to strike at these targets, but neither their motivation
nor their capabilities are greatly enhanced by the recent events in Iraq.
<p>What can be expected, as in 1991, is a number of small, uncoordinated
local incidents, carried out by indigenous organizations that have on their
agenda the struggle against “imperialism,” “Zionism” or “The New World
Order.”

<br><a NAME="note"></a><b>Note:</b>
<br>On December 25, Osama bin Ladin declared in an interview with the London-based
Arabic newspaper <i>Asharq Al-Awsat </i>that U.S.-British airstrikes on
Iraq make it “a duty of Muslims to confront, fight and kill” Americans
and Britons. This because “the British and the American people loudly declared
their support for their leaders’ decision to attack Iraq.”&nbsp; This pronouncement
does not differ from the older accusations and threats proffered by bin
Ladin in his interviews and <i>fatwas</i> concerning the U.S. intervention
in Iraq.
<p>It is interesting to note that the next day, according to the independent
Pakistani newspaper <i>The News,</i> bin Ladin also accused the governor
of the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz, of plotting
his assassination. The accusation was officially denied by the Saudis.
<p>It is not clear which bothers bin Ladin more--the fate of the Iraqi
people or his own security, and the feeling that he is now continuously
pursued by American/Saudi agents.
