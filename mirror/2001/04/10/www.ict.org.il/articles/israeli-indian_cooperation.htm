<center><b><font size=+1>Israeli-Indian-Russian Cooperation on Counter-Terrorism</font></b></center>

<p><b>Reuven Paz</b>
<br><b>ICT Academic Director</b>
<p>The past weeks have witnessed two important visits to Israel of Indian
Ministers—Home Minister L.K. Advani in June and Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh in early July. Both visitors were the most senior Indian officials
to ever visit Israel. Mr. Advani was accompanied by the heads of the Indian
intelligence and investigative agencies. Among them the director general
of the border security force, the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation,
the Intelligence Bureau director, and the joint secretary for security
in the Home Ministry.
<p><b>“Shuttle Counter-Terrorism”</b>
<br>These visits were dedicated primarily to discussing future cooperation
in the field of counter-terrorism. The Indian senior Ministers came to
Israel a few days after the visit of the Russian Interior Minister Vladimir
Rushailo in Israel for the same purpose. Singh himself paid a visit to
Moscow at the end of June 2000, just a few days before he came to Israel.
In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to visit India in
October 2000.
<p>The timing of all this raises the question whether there is some connection
between these visits, all of which had the same purpose. The Indian Foreign
Minister Mr. Singh stressed that the threat of terrorism to India stretches
“all the way from the southern Caucasus to Western China.”
<p>All three senior visitors met with senior officials of the Israeli security
and law- enforcement establishments, beside their talks with Prime Minister
Barak, Foreign Minister Levy, and Interior Minister Sharansky. Israeli
Prime Minister was invited for the first time to visit India. Israel and
India also decided to establish an official body for counter-terrorism.
The Indian Foreign Minister declared that “while the types of terrorism
faced in India and Israel are different, there is enough similarity to
merit joint counter-action.”
<p>Meanwhile, Russian Interior Minister Rushailo told a press conference
on June 6<sup>th</sup> that he had signed two protocols of cooperation
between the Russian Interior Ministry and the Israeli law-enforcement bodies,
namely the General Security Service and the Israel Police. According to
the official Russian news agency ITAR-Tass, Rushailo stated also that “it
was common knowledge that foreign mercenaries, including those from Arab
countries, were fighting on the side of the Chechen terrorists. That is
why the problem of Chechen terrorism cannot be viewed as purely Russian,
and has got international aspects to it.”
<p>Israel has much experience in the field of counter-terrorism. On June
20<sup>th</sup> an editorial entitled, “Seeking Israel's help” appeared
in the Indian English daily, <i>The Hindu</i> wrote. The author noted that
“Obviously, Israel has a lot to offer and has acquired considerable expertise
and experience in dealing with similar problems, with quite some success.
Its very survival despite frequent violence and explosions, depends on
its ability to counter terrorist threats.” It is thus natural that states
facing heavy terrorism would approach Israel for cooperation on counter-terrorism.
What is interesting though, is that the field of counter-terrorism has
turned out to be a major factor in the improvement of relations with Israel,
especially in regard to India, which established official relations with
Israel only in 1992.
<p>Against the background of increasing Islamist terrorism in Xinjiang
in western China, it would be reasonable to see a Chinese-Israeli cooperation
in this field in the near future as well.
<p><b>Counter-Terrorism as a Strategic Issue</b>
<br>It seems that in all these cases of cooperation with Israel, primarily
in the case of India and China, counter-terrorism has become the second
strategic basis for cooperation after military ties. Military cooperation
has centered primarily on the aviation industry. In both cases Israel is
facing heavy pressures from the United States to reduce its military and
industrial cooperation.
<p>The main basis for strategic cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism
is not only the Israeli experience. Islamist radical terrorism has come
to be viewed in the West as a strategic threat, while at the same time
there has been a clear geographical shift of the focus of terrorist activity
from the Arab World to Central Asia. In the eyes of some decision-makers,
not to mention Western societies as a whole, Islam is becoming a synonym
for terrorism and violence. The Indian Foreign Minister stated in his visit
to Israel, that “it would be an error to treat all of Islam as terrorist,
but there are manifestations and tendencies in this direction… and elements
of Islam are being polluted by it.” Such a statement is not commonly made
by decision-makers—particularly during a visit to Israel—after decades
of warm relations with the Arab World and very cold relations with Israel.
<p><b>When “Freedom Fighters” Become “Terrorists”</b>
<br>It would seem that in recent years the Israeli experience in counter
terrorism has become a bridge to Asia. This is ironic in view of the decades
during which Israel was facing, in almost total isolation, heavy terrorist
activity against Israeli and Jewish targets—terrorist activity that was
never condemned by India and that was often indirectly sponsored by the
Soviet Union. India has suddenly found itself in an “Israeli” situation,
which was acutely felt after a British court ruling recently described
a Kashmiri terrorist as a “freedom fighter.”
<p>Israel was criticized for many years by both India and the Soviet Union
for fighting the Palestinian “freedom fighters,” even when these carried
out terrorist operations—operations which deliberately targeted civilians.
But, when terrorism reached their own back yards they hurried to learn
from the Israeli experience in fighting those “freedom fighters.”
<p>Moreover, according to the Indian press, the delegation of the Home
Ministry emphasized the need to learn from the Israeli experience in coping
with terrorism from South Lebanon and in the “security zone.” This underscores
the fact that India's major problem in the field of terrorism is cross-border
terrorism. In the past year, India has joined with Russia in the attempt
to present the situation in Afghanistan as a major security threat for
both countries. Both countries are doing their best to obtain international
support in attacking Afghanistan.
<p><b>Conclusions</b>
<br>The lesson for the international community in all this should be that
the phrase “freedom fighters” has outworn its usefulness. Those who use
terrorism to attack civilians cannot be defined as “freedom fighters”
by any objective individual, anywhere on earth. The second lesson is of
course that there is no substitute for international cooperation in fighting
terrorism; just as terrorism is an international issue, so must counter-terrorism
be an international issue.
