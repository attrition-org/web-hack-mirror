<P><B>Resolutions of the Palestine National Council</B>
<DIV ALIGN=right><I>July 1-17, 1968</I></DIV>


<P><B>Text of the Charter:</B>

<P><B>Article 1: </B>Palestine is the homeland of the Arab Palestinian
people; it is an indivisible part of the Arab homeland, and the Palestinian
people are an integral part of the Arab nation.

<P><B>Article 2: </B>Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the British
Mandate, is an indivisible territorial unit.

<P><B>Article 3:</B> The Palestinian Arab people possess the legal right
to their homeland and have the right to determine their destiny after achieving
the liberation of their country in accordance with their wishes and entirely
of their own accord and will.

<P><B>Article 4:</B> The Palestinian identity is a genuine, essential,
and inherent characteristic; it is transmitted from parents to children.
The Zionist occupation and the dispersal of the Palestinian Arab people,
through the disasters which befell them, do not make them lose their Palestinian
identity and their membership in the Palestinian community, nor do they
negate them.

<P><B>Article 5: </B>The Palestinians are those Arab nationals who, until
1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were evicted
from it or have stayed there. Anyone born, after that date, of a Palestinian
father - whether inside Palestine or outside it - is also a Palestinian.

<P><B>Article 6: </B>The Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until
the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians.

<P><B>Article 7: </B>That there is a Palestinian community and that it
has material, spiritual, and historical connection with Palestine are indisputable
facts. It is a national duty to bring up individual Palestinians in an
Arab revolutionary manner. All means of information and education must
be adopted in order to acquaint the Palestinian with his country in the
most profound manner, both spiritual and material, that is possible. He
must be prepared for the armed struggle and ready to sacrifice his wealth
and his life in order to win back his homeland and bring about its liberation.

<P><B>Article 8:</B> The phase in their history, through which the Palestinian
people are now living, is that of national (watani) struggle for the liberation
of Palestine. Thus the conflicts among the Palestinian national forces
are secondary, and should be ended for the sake of the basic conflict that
exists between the forces of Zionism and of imperialism on the one hand,
and the Palestinian Arab people on the other. On this basis the Palestinian
masses, regardless of whether they are residing in the national homeland
or in diaspora (mahajir) constitute - both their organizations and the
individuals - one national front working for the retrieval of Palestine
and its liberation through armed struggle.

<P><B>Article 9: </B>Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine.
This it is the overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase. The Palestinian
Arab people assert their absolute determination and firm resolution to
continue their armed struggle and to work for an armed popular revolution
for the liberation of their country and their return to it . They also
assert their right to normal life in Palestine and to exercise their right
to self-determination and sovereignty over it.

<P><B>Article 10: </B>Commando action constitutes the nucleus of the Palestinian
popular liberation war. This requires its escalation, comprehensiveness,
and the mobilization of all the Palestinian popular and educational efforts
and their organization and involvement in the armed Palestinian revolution.
It also requires the achieving of unity for the national (watani) struggle
among the different groupings of the Palestinian people, and between the
Palestinian people and the Arab masses, so as to secure the continuation
of the revolution, its escalation, and victory.

<P><B>Article 11: </B>The Palestinians will have three mottoes: national
(wataniyya) unity, national (qawmiyya) mobilization, and liberation.

<P><B>Article 12: </B>The Palestinian people believe in Arab unity. In
order to contribute their share toward the attainment of that objective,
however, they must, at the present stage of their struggle, safeguard their
Palestinian identity and develop their consciousness of that identity,
and oppose any plan that may dissolve or impair it.

<P><B>Article 13: </B>Arab unity and the liberation of Palestine are two
complementary objectives, the attainment of either of which facilitates
the attainment of the other. Thus, Arab unity leads to the liberation of
Palestine, the liberation of Palestine leads to Arab unity; and work toward
the realization of one objective proceeds side by side with work toward
the realization of the other.

<P><B>Article 14: </B>The destiny of the Arab nation, and indeed Arab existence
itself, depend upon the destiny of the Palestine cause. From this interdependence
springs the Arab nation's pursuit of, and striving for, the liberation
of Palestine. The people of Palestine play the role of the vanguard in
the realization of this sacred (qawmi) goal.

<P><B>Article 15:</B> The liberation of Palestine, from an Arab viewpoint,
is a national (qawmi) duty and it attempts to repel the Zionist and imperialist
aggression against the Arab homeland, and aims at the elimination of Zionism
in Palestine. Absolute responsibility for this falls upon the Arab nation
- peoples and governments - with the Arab people of Palestine in the vanguard.
Accordingly, the Arab nation must mobilize all its military, human, moral,
and spiritual capabilities to participate actively with the Palestinian
people in the liberation of Palestine. It must, particularly in the phase
of the armed Palestinian revolution, offer and furnish the Palestinian
people with all possible help, and material and human support, and make
available to them the means and opportunities that will enable them to
continue to carry out their leading role in the armed revolution, until
they liberate their homeland.

<P><B>Article 16: </B>The liberation of Palestine, from a spiritual point
of view, will provide the Holy Land with an atmosphere of safety and tranquility,
which in turn will safeguard the country's religious sanctuaries and guarantee
freedom of worship and of visit to all, without discrimination of race,
color, language, or religion. Accordingly, the people of Palestine look
to all spiritual forces in the world for support.

<P><B>Article 17: </B>The liberation of Palestine, from a human point of
view, will restore to the Palestinian individual his dignity, pride, and
freedom. Accordingly the Palestinian Arab people look forward to the support
of all those who believe in the dignity of man and his freedom in the world.

<P><B>Article 18: </B>The liberation of Palestine, from an international
point of view, is a defensive action necessitated by the demands of self-defense.
Accordingly the Palestinian people, desirous as they are of the friendship
of all people, look to freedom-loving, and peace-loving states for support
in order to restore their legitimate rights in Palestine, to re-establish
peace and security in the country, and to enable its people to exercise
national sovereignty and freedom.

<P><B>Article 19: </B>The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the establishment
of the state of Israel are entirely illegal, regardless of the passage
of time, because they were contrary to the will of the Palestinian people
and to their natural right in their homeland, and inconsistent with the
principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, particularly
the right to self-determination.

<P><B>Article 20: </B>The Balfour Declaration, the Mandate for Palestine,
and everything that has been based upon them, are deemed null and void.
Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with Palestine are incompatible
with the facts of history and the true conception of what constitutes statehood.
Judaism, being a religion, is not an independent nationality. Nor do Jews
constitute a single nation with an identity of its own; they are citizens
of the states to which they belong.

<P><B>Article 21: </B>The Arab Palestinian people, expressing themselves
by the armed Palestinian revolution, reject all solutions which are substitutes
for the total liberation of Palestine and all proposals aiming at the liquidation
of the Palestinian problem, or its internationalization.

<P><B>Article 22: </B>Zionism is a political movement organically associated
with international imperialism and antagonistic to all action for liberation
and to progressive movements in the world. It is racist and fanatic in
its nature, aggressive, expansionist, and colonial in its aims, and fascist
in its methods. Israel is the instrument of the Zionist movement, and geographical
base for world imperialism placed strategically in the midst of the Arab
homeland to combat the hopes of the Arab nation for liberation, unity,
and progress. Israel is a constant source of threat vis-a-vis peace in
the Middle East and the whole world. Since the liberation of Palestine
will destroy the Zionist and imperialist presence and will contribute to
the establishment of peace in the Middle East, the Palestinian people look
for the support of all the progressive and peaceful forces and urge them
all, irrespective of their affiliations and beliefs, to offer the Palestinian
people all aid and support in their just struggle for the liberation of
their homeland.

<P><B>Article 23: </B>The demand of security and peace, as well as the
demand of right and justice, require all states to consider Zionism an
illegitimate movement, to outlaw its existence, and to ban its operations,
in order that friendly relations among peoples may be preserved, and the
loyalty of citizens to their respective homelands safeguarded.

<P><B>Article 24: </B>The Palestinian people believe in the principles
of justice, freedom, sovereignty, self-determination, human dignity, and
in the right of all peoples to exercise them.

<P><B>Article 25: </B>For the realization of the goals of this Charter
and its principles, the Palestine Liberation Organization will perform
its role in the liberation of Palestine in accordance with the Constitution
of this Organization.

<P><B>Article 26: </B>The Palestine Liberation Organization, representative
of the Palestinian revolutionary forces, is responsible for the Palestinian
Arab people's movement in its struggle - to retrieve its homeland, liberate
and return to it and exercise the right to self-determination in it - in
all military, political, and financial fields and also for whatever may
be required by the Palestine case on the inter-Arab and international levels.

<P><B>Article 27: </B>The Palestine Liberation Organization shall cooperate
with all Arab states, each according to its potentialities; and will adopt
a neutral policy among them in the light of the requirements of the war
of liberation; and on this basis it shall not interfere in the internal
affairs of any Arab state.

<P><B>Article 28: </B>The Palestinian Arab people assert the genuineness
and independence of their national (wataniyya) revolution and reject all
forms of intervention, trusteeship, and subordination.

<P><B>Article 29: </B>The Palestinian people possess the fundamental and
genuine legal right to liberate and retrieve their homeland. The Palestinian
people determine their attitude toward all states and forces on the basis
of the stands they adopt vis-a-vis to the Palestinian revolution to fulfill
the aims of the Palestinian people.

<P><B>Article 30: </B>Fighters and carriers of arms in the war of liberation
are the nucleus of the popular army which will be the protective force
for the gains of the Palestinian Arab people.

<P><B>Article 31:</B> The Organization shall have a flag, an oath of allegiance,
and an anthem. All this shall be decided upon in accordance with a special
regulation.

<P><B>Article 32:</B> Regulations, which shall be known as the Constitution
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, shall be annexed to this Charter.
It will lay down the manner in which the Organization, and its organs and
institutions, shall be constituted; the respective competence of each;
and the requirements of its obligation under the Charter.

<P><B>Article 33: </B>This Charter shall not be amended save by [vote of]
a majority of two-thirds of the total membership of the National Congress
of the Palestine Liberation Organization [taken] at a special session convened
for that purpose.
