<p><img SRC="../graphics/november_17_w.gif" height=183 width=200 align=RIGHT>Two
months after the murder of British military attach&eacute; Brigadier Stephen
Saunders by the Revolutionary Organization November 17, Greece is still
trying to recover and learn from the incident, in order to insure safety
in the future.
<p>The Revolutionary Organization November 17, named after a 1973 students'
uprising in Athens against the military regime, is an extreme left-wing
organization, opposed to imperialism and capitalism, and virulently anti-United
States and NATO. Most of the group’s actions have been aimed at American
and European Union officials and interests, though Turkish and local governmental
interests have been targeted as well.
<p>Over 20 assassinations were conducted by the organization since its
first action in 1975. However, Greek security officials say that almost
nothing is known about the organization and its activists. The group continues
to evade the authorities, probably due to its small size. It’s members
were even bold enough to tease the police in 1999, sending a message via
the press, to “come and get” them.
<p>The murder of Brigadier Saunders was well planned and indicates that
the group possessed accurate information about Saunders’ life style. He
was singled out, according to November 17’s claim of responsibility, due
to his role in NATO’s “barbaric air-strikes” against the former Yugoslavia
last year. The British Ministry of Defense denied Saunders’ role in the
matter.
<p>It should be noted that there are several other violent yet less-familiar
groups operating in Greece, including the Anarchist Street Patrol, Revolutionary
Organization Red Line, The Children of November, The Conscientious Arsonists
and Satanist groups. It is not known which of these groups are front groups
or alias for November 17.
<p>Facing the risk of being branded as an unsafe country, Greece has attempted
to develop and demonstrate an ability to prevent such attacks from re-occurring.
This approach is mainly meant to reflect an image of a state that is active
in the field of counter terrorism. The need to rebuild Greece’s image abroad
was especially felt in the face of a report by the U.S. Congress’ National
Commission on Terrorism. The report, issued on June 5<sup>th</sup> 2000
(prior to the murder of Brigadier Saunders) defined Greece as a “state
not cooperating fully” in counter terrorism.
<p>Athens is also keen to improve Greece’s chances of profiting—both financially
and politically—from the upcoming 2004 Athens Olympic Games, and to prevent
criticism and damage to the country’s status within the EU. This is important
with regard to accusations regarding the Greek support of PKK leader Ocalan.
The Greek government has been at pains to demonstrate a willingness to
join the West’s united front against terrorism, while bolstering the perception
of security for foreigners visiting Greece.

<p><b><font size=+1>Affirmative steps in counter-terrorism</font></b>
<p>Despite the fact that Greece has been facing terrorist incidents for
decades, the assassination of Brigadier Saunders seems to be a turning
point in the way the Greek government, security forces and public, view
the problem of terrorism.
<p>The Greek authorities have been singularly unsuccessful in their efforts
to track down the members of November 17 and its rival organizations. The
international outcry created by the killing of Saunders led both the public
and members of the government to call for more drastic and dramatic steps
in countering the terrorists.
<p><b>Tactical steps</b>
<p>Immediately after Saunder’s assassination, the Greek government offered
a reward for information on the assassins. At the same time, the security
forces launched a manhunt, setting up roadblocks throughout Athens, and
planting plainclothes policemen to gather information and track down members
of the elusive terrorist group. A reconstruction of the murder was held,
and the local police forces gave the investigation top priority. Although
these measures were standard responses to such an attack they seem to have
been applied on wider scale than is usual.
<p>So far, the police efforts seem in vain. Initial reports in <i>the London
Times</i> claiming that a list of 20 suspects had been compiled were denied
by both British and Greek sources.
<p><b>Cooperation in the counter-terrorism</b>
<p>At the strategic and operational levels, the government chose the route
of cooperation with parties whose experience in combating terrorism could
prove beneficial. Intense cooperation was rapidly established with the
UK. Immediately after the attack Britain sent counter-terrorism experts
to Greece for consultations with their Greek counterparts.
<p>On July 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> a counter-terrorism seminar
was held with the participation of high-level British security personnel.
Several Greek ministers attended the seminar, including Minister of Public
Order Chrysohoidis, and Foreign Minister Papandreou, as well as British
Ambassador Madden. Following this seminar, recommendations were made to
reorganize the security forces and to construct a single anti-terrorism
body, similar to the British CTPD. British officials also proposed sophisticated
surveillance techniques, and the use of the media in the battle against
terrorism. In addition, the two countries agreed to hold joint anti-terrorist
exercises and to exchange technological knowledge in the field.
<p>In July, British Foreign Ministry personnel met with their Greek counterparts,
including a meeting between Foreign Ministry Undersecretary, Baroness Scotland
on July 14<sup>th</sup> and Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou, Public Order
Minister Chrysohoidis, New Democracy Deputy Bakoyainni, and Justice Minister
Stathopoulos. Collaboration was also intensified within the lower operational
levels, and included, for example a bilateral meeting between British and
Greek policemen.
<p>This cooperation between the two countries is natural, due to Britain’s
long experience in counter-terrorism from combating the IRA. But it is
also seen as an opportunity for Greece to send a message of reconciliation
to Britain and to show its sincere intention not to allow the re-occurrence
of such incidents.
<p>With regard to the European Union, Greece expressed its willingness
to conduct counter-terrorism cooperation with other EU states during meeting
of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg on June 13<sup>th </sup>—an offer that
was greeted warmly by the British. It seems that the Amsterdam Treaty is
an efficient framework for such collaboration.
<p>Public Order Minister Chrysohoidis claimed that a protocol of cooperation
against terrorism would be signed with the United States in September.
The issue of counter-terrorism also came up during a meeting held on July
6<sup>th</sup> between U.S. and Greek officials in Athens.
<p>For all this, Britain has emerged as playing the dominant role in Greek
international counter-terrorism efforts. This is due largely to what the
Greeks see as Britain’s less patronizing and coercive attitude in comparison
to the U.S. In addition, it seems simpler and more beneficial to rely on
the British than the European Union, which is lacking in the necessary
experience.
<p><b>Legislative Recommendations</b>
<p>The UK strongly recommended that Greece adopt a comprehensive Anti-terrorism
Bill—without weadening the country’s commitment to human rights—similar
to the one legislated in Britain.
<p>The U.S. also proposed changes in existing Greek anti-terrorism laws,
in order to gain the support of the public in volunteering information
to the police, to increase punishments for terrorism, and to increase the
authorities’ independence and level of expertise. A thorough modification
in the anti-terrorism laws will have to take place in order to adapt the
laws to the intended joint agreement of the two countries. The changes
proposed so far are rather similar to the principles of the recommendations
made by the U.S.
<p><b>Symbolic steps</b>
<p>Immediately after the attack on Brigadier Saunders, Greek Politicians
expressed anger and claimed that the government would be “most merciless”
in fighting this phenomena. Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou said that
the government “will not let the international image of the country be
plagued.”
<p>Nationwide discontent and a lack of a sense of security drove the Greeks
to hold a publicity campaign featuring a moment of silence and broadcasting
anti-terrorism messages over the public communication networks. These broadcasts
stressed the threat posed by terrorism to human life, social and political
order and thus to culture and democratic values. Moreover, Saunders’ widow
made several televised appearances, during which she asked for the help
of the public in fighting terrorism and tracking down her husband’s killers.
<p>It seems that this extensive use of the media was meant to achieve a
number of goals. First, it was intended to unite Greek public opinion against
a common enemy. Second, these steps have a practical purpose, which is
to put pressure on the public to reveal any piece of information they may
have. Third, the campaign sends a clear signal to the world—especially
the U.S. and Europe—regarding Greece’s commitment to fighting terrorism.
Forth, the officials’ public statements were meant to clear their names,
after accusations were made against them that they were turning a blind
eye towards the terrorist organizations. Last, this anti-terrorism propaganda
is a message to the organization itself that it enjoys little or no public
support. That is contrary to the positive public opinion it enjoyed in
the past due to its “Robin Hood” image, as its targets were, as mentioned,
either governmental or wealthy.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Foreign reactions to the assassination</font></b>
<p>Britain was stricken by the assassination of Brigadier Saunders, and
held a vast burial ceremony.
<p>Though security was tightened slightly around British diplomats in Athens,
and Britain immediately announced that an extensive review of the embassy’s
security procedures would take place, there is still much discontent. The
British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee accused the Foreign Office
of not doing enough to protect its personnel. This Committee classified
Greece as a possible terrorist target prior to the incident, and after
it urged the government to set aside more funds for protecting diplomats
abroad. It mentioned that Britain devotes less money than does the United
States and thus constitutes an “easy target” compared to American facilities.
The British willingness to cooperate with the Greeks in this field may
seem like their way of dealing with these accusations in a financially
affordable way.
<p>So far no harsh responses were detected from the European community.
On the contrary, about two weeks after the assassination, Greece proceeded
as planned in strengthening its ties with the Union, adopting the Euro
as the common currency.
<p>Nevertheless, this attack will have an effect on Greece, as one of the
last members to join the Union, and could damage its attempt to be seen
as a “European” state, rather than a “Mediterranean” or a “Balkan” state.
A comparison will no doubt be made with European states such as Italy and
Germany that fought successful battles against terrorism—a battle that
up until now Greece has failed to win.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<p><b><font size=+1>U.S. – Greek counter-terrorism</font></b>
<p>Only a few days before the assassination of Brigadier Saunders, a commission
appointed by the U.S. Congress recommended classifying Greece as a state
“not cooperating fully” in counter terrorism. This status means, according
to a U.S. statue, that Greece will not be permitted to purchase military
equipment from the U.S. Though the commission recommended also removing
Greece from the “Visa Waver” program, Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright,
announced that no such sanction would be imposed.
<p>Additionally, senior foreign policy associate, Wayne Merry blamed Greece
for having a passive counter terrorism policy and implied that the November
17 organization is connected with high-ranked officials, among them Foreign
Minister Papandreou. Similar accusations were made by former CIA Director,
James Wollsey, who said that Greece hasn’t been doing enough, though it
possesses sufficient knowledge to capture the group’s members. Greece,
according to the Americans, is second only to Colombia in the numbers of
terrorist actions against U.S. targets.
<p>These accusations were not left unanswered. The Greek Embassy in the
U.S. as well as the Greek community there responded rather bluntly. Words
of encouragement were heard from their side with regard to cooperation
with the U.S. in counter terrorism. Nevertheless, they resented the classification
of Greece as “not cooperating,” implying that it is impossible to compare
Greece to terrorism- supporting states such as Iran or Syria. They noted
that the primary motives of the November 17 group are connected with internal
politics, and accordingly most its targets are locals. It was emphasized
that the rumors about alleged cooperation between government officials
and the November 17 organization are false and unsupported by evidence,
as some ministers and their relatives were also victims of the organization’s
violence. Both the Embassy and the Greek community tried to maintain an
image of Greece as a well-trusted American ally during the past decades,
and mentioned that even the U.S. itself experienced difficulties in combating
terrorist in several occasions.
<p>It seems that the Greeks are discontent with the attempts to “twist
their arm” and force them to decide on a new policy. This is due to the
history of the relations of the two countries: the U.S. is infamous for
its massive support and involvement in the Greek military regime (1967
– 74).

<p><b><font size=+1>Conclusions: Looking Ahead to the 2004 Olympics</font></b>
<p>As mentioned, The assassination of Military Attach&eacute; Brigadier
Saunders by Revolutionary Organization November 17, though not a turning
point in Greek daily life, has had an impact on the country’s counter-terrorism
policy. The assassination forced the Greek Government to seek help from
professionals in other countries, to increase the number of security personnel
in the streets, to consider the reorganization of its security forces and
changes in its anti-terrorism legislation, and to make extensive use of
media propaganda.
<p>All of this will have an application in the current preparations for
the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004. Challenged to prove its counter-terrorism
abilities, and determined not to lose the financial and political privileges
of hosting the event, Greece is attempting to assess the potential dangers
and act accordingly. Traumatized by several terrorist attacks which took
place during previous Olympic Games, including the murder of Israeli athletes
in Munich in 1972, and the planting of a bomb at the Atlanta games in 1996,
the world is watching the Greek preparations with a critical eye.
<p>A complete security plan has been drawn up and reviewed by the Greeks,
and will be presented to the Olympic Committee and to U.S. officials in
mid-September. Special attention has been devoted to securing the means
of transportation and the coastal areas. Technical knowledge and equipment
must to be acquired, the police force enlarged, and according to the Public
Order Minister, will be better equipped. After learning the benefits of
cooperation and consultation, the Greeks are looking into hiring a security
advisor and attempting to learn form the experience of Australia at the
upcoming Sydney Olympic games. If all measures are applied properly, hopes
are that, as Public Order Minister Chrysohoidis said, conditions will be
such that, “it will be impossible to have terrorist attacks.”
