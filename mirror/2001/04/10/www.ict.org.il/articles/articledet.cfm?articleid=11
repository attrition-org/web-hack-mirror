<P>Hamas (The Islamic Resistance Movement) emerged as an Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) during the Palestinian uprising (<I>Intifada</I>). In
its religious vision, political and social goals, and communal action Hamas
challenged the PLO as an exclusive political center of the Palestinian
people, Hamas suggested an Islamic-nationalist doctrine instead of the
PLO's secular nationalism and compromising political program regarding
Palestinianhood and national territory, without essentially altering the
latter's original maximalist goals and military means to achieve them.
It is the Islamic ideology that shapes Hamas' political strategy as well
as the rules and norms of its envisioned Palestinian state and society,
with which Hamas has distinguished itself from the PLO. Yet, much of Hamas
politics can be explained in terms of the tension between the dogmatic
and the pragmatic approaches to the solution of the Palestinian problem,
a tension between adherence to the radical Islamic principle of holy war
(<I>jihad</I>) against Israel as a duty and as the most effective way to
liberate Palestine and the awareness to the necessity of political considerations
without abandoning the armed struggle.

<P>This study endeavors to portray Hamas' worldview and to examine its
conduct since its emergence at the beginning of the Palestinian uprising
(<I>Intifada</I>) in late 1987. It also attempts to follow the ideological
trends and political considerations that shaped Hamas' strategies of action
and evaluate its options under circumstances of continued diplomatic process
between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

<P>The study is based on primary sources, mostly unpublished Arabic documents.
They include leaflets and internal papers of Hamas as well as Palestinian,
Islamic, and Israeli press.

<P><A NAME="roots"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Roots and Perceptions</FONT></B>
<BR>Hamas' origins have been rooted in the Muslim Brotherhood Society (MB)
(<I>jama'at al-ikhwan al-muslimin</I>) in the Gaza Strip and more specifically,
in its main embodiment since the late 1970s - <I>al-Mujamma' al-Islami</I>.
Under the Egyptian military government in the Gaza Strip (1948-1967), the
MB activity was tolerated or repressed along with the policy conducted
against the MB in Egypt itself. Thus, following the ban on the MB in Egypt
in early 1949, the MB branch in Gaza was reshaped into a religious-educational
center under the title Unification [of God] Association (<I>jam'iyyat al-tawhid</I>).
During the short-lived honeymoon of relations between the Free Officers
regime and the MB (1952-1954) the MB in the Strip prospered, attracting
many young Palestinians in the refugee camps as well as in Egyptian universities.
Yet the new, and long-standing, ban on the MB in Egypt in 1954 - following
a MB attempt on Nasir's life--determined the hostile nature of relationship
between the Nasirist regime and the MB, leading to the adoption of systematic
repression against its leading members in the Gaza Strip as well. This
forced the MB in the Strip to assume secret and discrete activity which,
along with the pressure of the Arab nationalist wave in the early 1960s,
led to the disintegration of the association. Nasir's harsh policy against
the MB in Egypt reached the zenith in the aftermath of the coup d'etat
attempt in 1965, which led to the arrest of thousands of the association's
activists in Egypt, among whom was Ahmad Yasin, later the founder of Hamas.<A HREF="#a1">1</A>

<P>The origins of Islamic awakening in historic Palestine were not different
from other countries in the Middle East which, since the late 1960s, has
demonstrated itself as the most significant ideological, social, and political
trend. Contemporary Islamic movements share the ideal of the Prophet's
Muslim society, a religious and political community with the <I>shari'a</I>
(the Islamic Law) as its sole source of law as well as the norm for individual
behavior. Only the boundaries of the community of the faithful (<I>umma</I>)
determine the boundaries of political power with no territorial definition
for the Islamic state which is to be universal. Yet under this umbrella,
mainstream Islamists have assumed typical national character, acquiescing
in the existing international order of states and restricting their activity
within state boundaries.<A HREF="#a2">2</A> Furthermore, modern radical
Islam is highly fragmented within states, represented by political groups,
movements, and formal parties that differ in their ideological zealotry,
political platform, means, and relations with the ruling elite. Olivier
Roy discerned two poles of Islamic thought which had marked contemporary
Islamic movements in the 20th century: a revolutionary pole, for whom Islamization
of the society is attained through state power, and a reformist pole for
whom the advent of the Islamic state is the result of social and political
action from bottom up aimed primarily to re-Islamize the society (neofundamentalism).<A HREF="#a3">3</A>

<P>One may assume that under the unique circumstances of Jewish domination
in Palestine and military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian
Islamists would be decisively inclined toward revolutionary political Islam.
In reality, however, the MB in the occupied territories oscillated between
two main attitudes and strategies of action concerning nationalist vis-a-vis
all-Islamic priorities. As of the early 1980s, the Palestinian Islamist
spectrum was defined, on the activist-nationalist end, by the Islamic Jihad
Movement (<I>harakat al-jihad al-islami</I>) whose main thrust was "armed
struggle now" for the liberation of Palestine in its entirety.

<P>The proponents of this approach envisioned the mobilization of Islam
in the liberation of Palestine. Until 1987, however, the mainstream of
the Palestinian MB followed the universal, normative approach to the issue
of Jihad. The representative of this approach was The Islamic Association
(<I>al-mujamma' al-islami</I>) which, since its establishment in 1979,
constituted the MB's main organization the Gaza Strip. The <I>Mujamma'</I>,
defined its goals sheerly in terms of individual acommunal work in the
fields of preaching and education, health care, charity and social welfare
in the spirit of Islamic moral tradition.<A HREF="#a4">4</A>

<P>That the <I>Mujamma'</I> continued to focus on reformist approach of
Islamic action from bottom up was due to Israel's tacit consent to Islamic
education, preaching and establishment of social and religious infrastructure.
Apparently, the Israeli authorities perceived this brand of Islamic activity
as harmless and a potential for balancing the nationalist militant movements
under the PLO's umbrella.<A HREF="#a5">5</A> Thus, whereas the Islamic
Jihad adopted unequivocal Palestinian nationalist affiliation, the <I>Mujamma'</I>
claimed allegiance to an abstract Islamic identity, blurring the boundaries
between state (<I>dawla</I>) and Islamic nation (<I>umma</I>), and to the
"great religion<I>" (al-din al-'azim</I>) and its written law--the <I>Qur'an</I>.<A HREF="#a6">6</A>

<P>Until the breakout of the <I>Intifada</I> the <I>Mujamma'</I> adhered
to the definition of the "internal jihad" within the Muslim community as
a priority over the "external jihad" against Israel and the West. Political
weakness apparently decided the choice of the <I>Mujamma'</I> founders
that external Jihad had to be suspended until the advent of the Islamic
state which would assume responsibility for it. Since the very existence
of Israel was a result of abandoning Islamic norms, only when Islamization
of society is completed and the Shari'a fully implemented that the Muslims
would be capable of defeating Israel.<A HREF="#a7">7</A>

<P>The <I>Intifada</I> highlighted both the primacy and urgency of national
Palestinian activism. The advent of Hamas indicated a shift of the <I>Mujamma's
</I>center of gravity from all-Islamic vision with a focus on communal,
civic activities to the nationalist sphere. From a movement fully dedicated
to enhancement of family and community life, the <I>Mujamma' </I>core shifted
toward political activism and violence against Israel for the sake of establishing
an Islamic state on the whole territory of historic Palestine.

<P>The <I>Intifada</I> resulted in a strong public claim among the Palestinians
for a comprehensive mobilization of all individual and collective efforts
for the sake of national struggle. The mass eruption of anger and frustration
revealed the magnitude of the ethos of national resistance to Israel, turning
the contribution and sacrifices of any organized group the main criterion
of political legitimacy. By establishing Hamas the <I>Mujamma'</I> founding
fathers legitimized the Jihad as a means for Islamic redemption, responding
to current circumstances and pressures from within and recognizing the
primacy of Palestinian nationalist action with the <I>Intifada</I> as its
center-stage. Furthermore, failure to bandwagon the <I>Intifada</I> run
the risk of loosing the opportunity for mass mobilization and defection
of young Islamists from the <I>Mujamma'</I> ranks.<A HREF="#a8">8</A>

<P>The active participation of Hamas in the <I>Intifada</I> came as a threat
to the PLO's hitherto exclusive role in the national arena. Concern that
Hamas might lead to fragmentation and weakening of the <I>Intifada</I>
effort resulted in the PLO's recurrent argument that it was Israel that
brought to Hamas establishment in order to divide and weaken the <I>Intifada</I>
and the PLO's position (similar accusations were made even after the onset
of the Palestinian Self-Governing Authority in June 1994).<A HREF="#a9">9</A>
Despite previous Fatah's criticism of the Islamic movement for not contributing
to the national activity, acceleration of the tension between Hamas and
Fatah was inevitable once Hamas begun to compete with the United National
Command (UNC, the PLO-based <I>Intifada</I> leadership) over the day-to-day
agenda of the uprising, employing leaflets as the main instrument of public
communication and strategies of struggle against Israel, including armed
struggle.

<P><A NAME="islamism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamism and Nationalism</FONT></B>
<BR>From the outset, the <I>Mujamma'</I> represented an alternative discourse
to the dominating Palestinian national one represented by the PLO. With
the outbreak of the <I>Intifada</I>, the advent of Hamas as an ex-PLO movement,
combining Palestinian nationalism and Islamism, clashed head-on with the
PLO's claim for exclusive national authority. In August 1988, over eight
months after its foundation, Hamas presented a basic ideological platform
which assumed an unmistakable nationalist character, drawing on the same
principles of the <U>Palestinian National Charter</U> yet casting them
in Islamic terminology and context.l0 <U>The Islamic Charter</U> effectively
proclaimed the PLO's Charter null and void, to be replaced by a true one,
uncompromisingly faithful, on the one hand, to the Palestinian national
principles as well as to the Islamic beliefs and values. Hamas Charter
reiterated the MB 's slogan of "Allah is the target, the Messenger is the
model, the Qur'an is its constitution, jihad is its path and death for
the sake of Allah is its most sublime aspiration" (article 8), defining
among its objectives to establish the rule of Islam, combating injustice
and falsehood. Yet Hamas Covenant clearly paid little attention to the
MB's core initial goal of transforming the society, placing much greater
emphasis on retrieve the Palestinian homeland from the river to the sea
in its entirety, and the means to fulfill this goal. Underlining its wholeness
and indivisibility, the land of Palestine was defined as an Islamic endowment
(<I>waqf</I>) "consecrated for future Muslim generations until Judgment
Day" (article 11). Under this definition, any compromise of the land was
absolutely unlawful and forbidden by the Islamic Law.

<P>According to its charter Hamas is a "universal movement", and "one of
the wings of the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine" (article 2 &amp; 7).
At the same time, Hamas is defined as a "distinguished Palestinian movement,"
whose struggle is to be waged over "every inch of Palestine" (article 6).
Since Palestine is an Islamic problem, Hamas nationalism is part of the
religious creed. Fighting the enemy that threatens a Muslim land is the
most sacred duty of every individual Muslim (<I>fad'ayn</I>), man, woman
or slave (article 12 &amp; 15). Any political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is rejected as an act against Islam. Thus, there is no other solution
to this dispute but Jihad.

<P>In view of these attitudes, Hamas could not but reject the PLO's secularist
national strategy. Instead, the liberation of Palestine is perceived as
the responsibility of three concentric circles: the Palestinian people,
the Arab world and the Islamic world. Yet Hamas' Charter stated its willingness
to fully subordinate itself to the PLO if it adopts Islam as its way of
life (article 27), reiterating the kinship and national bonds linking the
two rival movements, and expressing underlying fear of internal strife.

<P><A NAME="dilemmas"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas' Dilemmas</FONT></B>
<BR>The adoption of Palestinian national values by Hamas was necessary
for its development as a political alternative to the PLO. Failure to do
that was tantamount to an acquiescence in a state of marginality and possibly
demise. Furthermore, Hamas' tacit claim for all-Palestinian leadership
obliged the new movement to address a wide spectrum of issues relevant
to its specific constituency, manifesting a high level of attendance to
the populace needs and its ability to adapt to the decisions on practical
daily issues.

<P>Hamas' effort to secure a dominant public position through a commitment
to advance particular Palestinian interests, and at the same time to maintain
its affiliation to universal Islamic vision confronted Hamas with acute
dilemmas. These dilemmas, which accompanied Hamas since its establishment
at the beginning of the <I>Intifada</I>, aggravated especially since the
September 1993 Israel-PLO Oslo accord and the establishment of the PNA
in Gaza and Jericho in June 1994.

<P>Hamas' awareness of the need to secure its presence and influence within
the Palestinian population, amid competition with the PNA, necessitated
flexibility of its uncompromising attitude toward a settlement with Israel.
That is, a willingness to consider measures that imply acquiescence and
even some form of participation in building the PNA. Such measures may
help Hamas to acquire legitimacy to its existence and maintain its position
in the Palestinian society. However, by adopting such a strategy Haruns
the risk of losing its uniqueness as a normative opposition to the PLO,
increasing the risk of friction within the movement, subjecting it to manipulation
by the nationalist movement represented by the PLO and the PNA. Adherence
to the dogmatic vision would also raise confusion and uncertainties. Conformity
to Hamas' stated religious doctrine strengthens its credibility among followers
and adversaries alike. At the same time, however, it runs the risk of undermining
the support of the Palestinian public, eager to see an end to their social
and economic hardships.

<P>The principle that guided Hamas' response to these dilemmas was based
on the assumption that the more the concept of a political dialogue with
Israel and cooperation with the PLO could be justified in normative terms
the less the possibility of being accused by its members and followers
of deviating from the ultimate vision, and the less the risk of organizational
disintegration. And one can best follow Hamas' efforts to justify its position
by analyzing its attitudes and policy toward Israel and the PLO during
the <I>Intifada</I> as well as to the Oslo agreement and establishment
of the PNA in Gaza and Jericho in June 1994. Hamas' positions combined
new political ideas with old beliefs, emphasizing long-run goals and short-run
requirements. They demonstrated conformity with the formal doctrine while
showing signs of political flexibility. Patterns of political adjustment
in terms of controlled violence, negotiated coexistence and calculated
participation in the PNA's emerging institutions became the main features
of Hamas' political conduct.

<CENTER><A NAME="violence"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>The Politics of Controlled
Violence</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Hamas' perception of Palestine as an inalienable Muslim endowment (<I>waqf</I>)
and commitment for its entire liberation from Israeli occupation leaves
no opening for a dialogue or a political settlement with Israel. Hamas
believes that the Jihad against Israel articulates the true aspirations
and needs of the Palestinian people, expressing the real meaning of Palestinian
national ethos.<A HREF="#b1">1</A> Yet Hamas' concern about the population's
daily interests and immediate needs increased its awareness and deepened
its hesitations to translate its dogmatic vision into practice. Calculated
policy and confrontational activities thus characterized its mode of operation.
This was reflected in Hamas' directives to the public about its role in
the uprising.<A HREF="#b2">2</A>

<P><A NAME="intifada"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The <I>Intifada</I> as a Controlled
Civil Revolt</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>
<BR>Hamas called upon the population to cooperate in both violent and non-violent
actions. The former included throwing stones and firebombs, building barriers,
burning tires, wielding knives and axes, dashing with the Israeli forces
and attacking collaborators. In the realm of non-violent activity, the
population was to take action in three areas: (1) to sever economic ties
with Israel and to build up local institutions which would provide substitute
public services; (2) to engage in civil disobedience, i.e., disobey laws
and regulations; and (3) to carry out activities that promote solidarity.

<P>An analysis of the first 30 leaflets issued by Hamas shows that of 139
violent and non-violent directives in Hamas leaflets, 36 (about 26% of
the total) appeared in the first ten leaflets, 40 (29%) in leaflets 11-20,
and 63 (more than 45%) in leaflets 21-30. The increase in the number of
directives was accompanied by a significant change over time, in the proportion
between instructions calling for violent or non-violent activity. While
the violence level of the Hamas was consistently high from the start of
the <I>Intifada</I>: 30.5% of the 36 instructions in the first 10 leaflets;
40% of 40 instructions in leaflets 11-20, and 39.7% of the 63 instructions
in leaflets 21-30, a drastic decrease is visible in the number of instructions
for severing ties with Israel in the realms of the economy and services.
From close to 25% in the first 20 leaflets, the calls to break economic
ties with Israel declined drastically to less than 5% in the leaflets 21-30.

<P>These trends reflect the contradictory considerations guiding Hamas'
behavior. On the one hand, Hamas was aware of the vital role played by
violence in propelling the Intafada and in securing political prestige.
On the other hand, the <I>Intifada</I>'s real capacity for endurance depended
on the Palestinian populace's economic soundness. In the absence of self
sustaining economic capability, dependence on Israel has become a way of
life, turning excessive pressure to sever contact with Israel ineffective.
To intensify the economic boycott against and disengagement from its economy
would mean economic hardship for tens of thousands of workers who earned
their living in Israel, and a huge loss of revenue for many local merchants
and factory owners who maintained commercial ties with Israeli firms. In
turn, a sever economic downturn in these sectors would weaken the influence
of the Hamas, stir disobedience and encourage anarchy. If the <I>Intifada</I>'s
strength lay in its ability to obtain the cooperation of all social strata
and age groups, it is really understandable how the ideologically heretical
suddenly became economically inevitable.

<P>The inability or unwillingness of merchants, factory owners and workers
to break off economic relations with Israel, forced Hamas to adapt itself
to the circumstances and bow to the constraints. Hence the drastic decrease
in the number of directives, urging an economic break with Israel. Instructions
in this spirit continued to appear, but more selectively. This was particularly
noticeable as regards work in Israel and the boycotting of Israeli products.
Later Hamas' leaflets noted clearly that the prohibition on working in
Israel was confined to days of general strikes or to persons employed in
sectors that competed with products of the territories, such as the citrus
industry. In the same vein, Hamas called for a boycott of products for
which local substitutes were available, notably milk products, agricultural
produce, cigarettes and soft drinks. The decline in the number of directives
calling for a total economic break with Israel indicates a reassessment
by Hamas concerning the limits of the <I>Intifada</I>. This awareness explains
why Hamas stepped back from declaring a general civil revolt and preferred
to hammer home the idea that the uprising, or Jihad, was a stage toward
a total revolt.

<P>The controlled civil revolt, like the continuous decline in the number
of directives calling for the severance of economic ties with Israel, was
an evidence thfrom the very beginning of the <I>Intifada</I>, Hamas had
calculated its strategy on the basis of cost\benefit considerations. Hamas
was avoiding a slide into absurdities in the efforts to realize its objectives.
Hamas recognized the limits of its power and was careful not to cross the
brink and fall into all-out confrontation with Israel. Jihad turned to
be not an ultimate goal but a political instrument subdued to political
considerations.

<P>Hamas' ability to differentiate between an all-out struggle and pragmatic
considerations depended to a large extent on its leadership's prestige
and authority to interpret the deviation in normative terms. In this context
the religious concept of <I>sabr</I> (self-command, perseverance) proved
useful in justifying restrained policies. <I>Sabr</I> was enlisted to justify
avoidance of confrontation with compelling realities as well as to justify
temporary acceptance of, and adaptation to, such realities. <I>Sabr</I>
has been explained and justified by the assumption that the true believers
will eventually prevail, no matter how despairing is the present. The future
will reward the present believer, but he must be patient ("Alla is with
the patients").<A HREF="#b3">3</A> Thus Sabr proved instrumental in explaining
that the struggle against Israel and the Jews should be based on cost\benefit
considerations despite their being the enemies of Islam.

<P><A NAME="oslo"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Controlled Violence and the Oslo
Accord</B></FONT>
<BR>Hamas' policy of controled violence against Israel sustained well after
the Oslo accord signed on September 13, 1993, reflecting pragmatic calculations
rather than captivity by dogmatic ideology.<A HREF="#b4">4</A> The Oslo
accord created a tight linkage between the PLO and the process of peaceful
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Military attacks
by Hamas against Israeli targets risked a halt of the peace process or
at least its slowdown. Such a prospect would portray Hamas among the Palestinians
in the occupied territories as an obstacle to further Israeli retreat and
erode the movement's public support. Also, such policy could lead to civil
strife and violent confrontation with the PNA which Hamas insisted to prevent
almost at any price.<A HREF="#b5">5</A> Yet peaceful co-existence with
the PNA at the price of ceasing the armed struggle against Israel would
risk a loss of Hamas' distinctiveness as a combatant movement for the liberation
of Palestine as a whole and the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian
state. Without the legitimacy shield of Jihad, Hamas would be exposed to
processes of encapsulation and coaptation that may lead to its disappearance
as a political power.<A HREF="#b6">6</A>

<P>While adhering to the armed struggle, Hamas subordinated the use of
violence against Israel to calculations of reckoning with the responses
of the PNA and the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Along this line Hamas assumed that controlled violence against Israel might
be desirable to the PNA, to instigate Israel's withdrawal from the occupied
territories. Thus whereas Hamas accelerated its attacks against Israel's
withdrawing forces from Gaza Strip, it adopted a "wait and see" position
during the first few months of the PNA, to examine the boundaries of freedom
of action under the new authority. Hamas' renewed violent attacks against
Israel derived from indications that Arafat had been trying to prevent
a clash head-on with the Islamists. This was indicated by the temporary
arrests of Hamas and Islamic Jihad members, and Arafat's permissive approach
to attacks against Israeli targets within the "green line." Arafat's approach
enabled the PNA to claim no accountability since the perpetrators had launched
their attacks from areas under Israel's administration.<A HREF="#b7">7</A>

<P>Indeed, Hamas' continuous military operations against Israel was tacitly
acceptable to the PNA, believing that it would also prevent internal confrontation
between Hamas and the PNA.<A HREF="#b8">8</A> Hamas insisted on continuous
jihad regardless of the Oslo process, maintaining that it complements the
diplomatic means and expedite Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and
application of Palestinian autonomy on this territory as a whole. True,
the PNA-Hamas dialogue conducted in the summer and fall of 1995 witnessed
a growing gap over the issue of controlled violence, mainly due to the
imposition of continued closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel
in retaliation to the terrorist attacks. Thus, while the Minister of Planning
in the PNA, Nabil Sha'ath, called for freezing the armed operations and
giving the diplomatic process a chance, Hamas leader Mahmud al-Zahar insisted
that the employment of arms was legitimate and that the simultaneous use
of war and peace possible.<A HREF="#b9">9</A>

<P>That Hamas armed struggle has been perceived as a means and not a goal
in its own right, was made clear by the movement's leading figures in Gaza.
Probably the most outspoken was Mahmud al-Zahar's statement that:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT SIZE=-1>We must calculate the benefit and cost of
continued armed operations. If we can fulfill our goals without violence,
we will do so. Violence is a means not a goal. Hamas' decision to adopt
self-restraint does not contradict our aims, including the establishment
of an Islamic state instead of Israel .... We will never recognize Israel
but it might be possible that a truce (muhadana) would prevail between
us for days, months or years ...</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#b10">10</A></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Hamas' policy of controlled violence, however, could hardly be a prescription
for stability. The Israel-PLO Oslo accord and the May 1994 Cairo agreement
on the establishment of the PNA in Gaza and Jericho were perceived by Hamas
as a strategic threat to its very existence. The more real this threat
seemed as a result of the progress in the diplomatic process between Israel
and the PNA-the more Hamas was willing to adopt the option of armed struggle
which risked the continued employment of controlled violence and the dialogue
with the PNA.

<P>On April 6 and 13, 1994, shortly before the signing of the Cairo Agreement
on the implementation of autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, two suicidal operations
were perpetrated in Afula and Hadera by Hamas' military wing, 'Izz al-Din
al-Qassam. The suicidal attacks meant to undermine the peace process by
manifesting Israel's vulnerability as well as enhancing Hamas' prestige
as the real Palestinian political leadership, and force Arafat's authority
to come to terms with Hamas as a legitimate opposition.<A HREF="#b11">11</A>
Israel's anti-terrorist operations against 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam, and Hamas'
growing fear that progress in the implementation of the Oslo accord was
bound to aggravate its marginalization, underpinned another wave of suicidal
bombings in Tel Aviv (October 1994) and in Ramat Gan and Jerusalem in July
and August 1995, respectively. The latter two attacks coincided with the
final phase of the Israel-PNA negotiations over Israel's withdrawal from
most of the Palestinian inhabited areas in the West Bank and the general
elections to the PNA's Council to be held thereafter.

<P>The signing of Oslo II agreement on September 28, 1995, apparently brought
Hamas leaders inside the territories to a decision to suspend the terrorist
attacks against Israel in order to avoid interruption of the Israeli withdrawal
from the Palestinian cities, and the preparation for elections to the PNA
Council, which could upset the Palestinian public. It was against this
backdrop that various groups of Hamas made attempts to employ this self-imposed
truce as a card in their encounter with the PNA and, indirectly, with Israel.
Yet while "inside" Hamas activists had supported an agreement with the
PNA on total cease of terrorist attacks against Israel, in the PNA-Hamas
talks held in Cairo in December 1995, the "outside" Hamas leadership forced
its refusal to accept such a truce. All that Hamas delegates were willing
to undertake was a vaguely phrased commitment for a temporary halt of military
operations against Israel from the autonomy areas and refraining from publicly
announcing, or admitting, responsibility to such attacks, in order to prevent
the PNA's "embarrassment."<A HREF="#b12">12</A>

<P>Although the Cairo talks ended with no official agreement, the leading
delegates did sign a joint communique. The document tacitly exposed their
mutunderstanding that since the defense of Israel was not the PNA's responsibility,
Hamas' armed struggle against Israel could continue as long as it would
not be waged from the PNA-controlled area.<A HREF="#b13">13</A> It is noteworthy
that the PNA was initially willing to accept such a vague commitment on
Hamas' part, apparently as the lesser evil, given the approaching date
of the general elections to the PNA Council, scheduled for January, and
in order to ensure their smooth conduct.<A HREF="#b14">14</A>

<P>However, the problematic of sustained policy of controlled violence
against Israel regardless of its geographical origin, Israel's retaliatory
policy of prolonged closures on the Palestinian population, and Israel's
covert killing of two leading Palestinian figures behind the suicidal attacks--the
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shiqaqi in Malta (26 October), and 'Izz al-Din
al-Qassam's "engineer" Yahya 'Ayyash (5 January, 1996)--all led to fierce
promises of their respective organizations to retaliate in revenge. Moreover,
the killing of Ayyash, apart from the duty to respond in kind to the murder
of a national martyr and save the movement's prestige, provided those groups
and individuals who wanted to upset the dialogue with the PNA a pretext
to resume the suicidal attacks.<A HREF="#b15">15</A> Hence, after a break
of six months, a wave of suicidal attacks in Jerusalem, Ashkelon, and Tel
Aviv in February-March 1996, was perpetrated by 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam.
While these operations represented a response in kind in order to prevent
loss of prestige in the Palestinian public, it also revealed the weakness
of the local political leadership and its lacking control over the movement's
armed apparatuses.<A HREF="#b16">16</A> Yet despite the PNA's crack down
on Hamas' military apparatuses following the February-March suicidal attacks,
under strict pressure of Israel and in coordination with its intelligence
services, Hamas adhered to the concept of prohibiting a confrontation with
the PNA. Moreover, Hamas demonstrated willingness to accept the PNA demand
to refrain from military operations against Israel, in return, the PNA
was to cease of persecution of 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam's members.<A HREF="#b17">17</A>

<P>Aware of the initial popular relief at Israel's withdrawal from the
occupied territories, Hamas forged a strategy that would secure its popularity
among the masses and arouse popular resistance to the Oslo process without
being accused of its failure's. Thus, Hamas followed a policy of controlled
violence against Israel and dialogue and coexistence with the PNA despite
the normative and political difficulties it entailed. Politics of adjustment
was perceived by Hamas as a lesser evil, considering the alternative of
a head-on collision with Israel and the PNA.

Conflict</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>The emergence of Hamas as a political and normative opposition to the
PLO was marked by a growing tension with the latter over both shaping the
day-to-day activities of the <I>Intifada</I> and the peace process. Yet,
due to Hamas' sense of political weakness, its attitude to the PLO was
marked by ambivalence, reflecting an effort to maintain a dialogue and
to ensure modes of coexistence.

<P><A NAME="plo"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The <I>Intifada</I> and Hamas-PLO
Relations</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>
<BR>During the <I>Intifada</I> Hamas manifested a conciliatory approach
to the PLO, praising its historical record of armed struggle and political
achievement in raising the Palestinian refugee problem internationally
to a national liberation issue.<A HREF="#c1">1</A> Hamas' approach reflected
awareness of the PLO's prestige and prominence in the Palestinian society,
striving to refute the latter's accusations pertaining to the MB's past
absence from the battle against Israel. Despite the fundamental differences
between the two leading Palestinian movements, Hamas persisted in proclaiming
its willingness for limited cooperation with the PLO on an agreed platform
for the liberation of Palestine as a whole in order to prevent intra-Palestinian
disputes.<A HREF="#c2">2</A> Especially in view of its total rejection
of the 1991 Madrid peace negotiations with Israel, Hamas' awareness of
its limited capabilities to liberate Palestine or confront Fatah, led to
the adoption of a rather realistic approach toward the issue of political
settlement with Israel, marked by calculated deviation from its stated
doctrine. In fact, the pattern of controlled violence against Israel also
characterized Hamas' efforts to seek a flexible strategy that would enable
the movement to coexist with the PLO without being identified with the
peace process or seem to have abandoned its original goal of establishing
an Islamic state over the whole territory of historic Palestine.

<P>This approach found its expression in various statements made by its
prominent leader, Sheikh Ahmad Yasin, during the <I>Intifada</I>. Following
are three examples:

<P>1) Hamas does not rule out the possibility of a Palestinian state in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip as long as it would be considered as a first
phase on the road to the establishment of a Palestinian state in all of
Palestine.<A HREF="#c3">3</A>

<P>2) Hamas is ready to consider international supervision in the territories
after the Israeli withdrawal as long as it would be limited in time and
would not require direct and clear cut concessions to Israel.<A HREF="#c4">4</A>

<P>3) Hamas will reject any attempt to enter into political negotiations
with Israel over peace agreement as long as Israel continued to control
the territories. However, Hamas would not exclude such initiative after
full Israeli withdrawal.<A HREF="#c5">5</A>

<P>Yasin's statements reflected deeply rooted tendencies within Hamas to
follow the prose of reality while at the same time, maintaining the poetry
of its ideology. By adopting a strategy of neither full acceptance nor
total rejection of the PLO's program of political settlement, Hamas waable
to justify its position in normative terms, interpreting such "concessions"
as tactical moves. While a final peace settlement with Israel is forbidden--and
if signed, would be null and void <I>a-priori</I>. Hamas left open the
option of an agreement with Israel provided that it assumes a temporary
form, denoting neither peace (<I>salam</I>) nor final conciliation (<I>sulh</I>);
that it coincides with the Muslims' interest (<I>maslaha</I>); and would
not legitimize the enemy's presence on an occupied Islamic land.<A HREF="#c6">6</A><P>Hamas demonstrated its flexibility by differentiating between short-term
goal of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza and a long-term goal
of establishing a Palestinian Islamic state on the whole territory of Palestine
that would replace Israel. Adopting this order of goals, Hamas practically
subordinated the former to the latter by emphasizing the transitional nature
and temporary status of any political settlement with Israel. Hamas disqualified
the PLO's legitimacy to represent the Palestinian people and, at the same
time, expressed willingness to enter into a political coalition with it
"on an agreed program focused on <I>jihad</I>."<A HREF="#c7">7</A>

<P>Indeed, during the <I>Intifada</I>, Hamas made an intensive effort to
attain official representation in all the popular, sectorial, and local
institution such as chambers of commerce, labor unions, professional organizations,
and student associations. The Hamas-PLO competition found its vivid expression
in their efforts toward mass mobilization through organized civil disobedience,
political and economic boycott, protestation, and strikes. As of late 1989,
PLO's frustrated attempts to pressure Hamas to accept the UNC authority
increased the tension between the two rival movements. Especially bothering
the PLO was Hamas' growing popularity, independent decisions regarding
the execution of collaborators, and setting separate dates for strikes
and protest which seemed to challenge the PLO's own authority represented
by the UNC. Another cause of tension between the two movements' activists
was the exclusion of Hamas by Fatah and the leftists from the prisoners'
committees in the Israeli prisons and detainee camps.<A HREF="#c8">8</A><P>These circumstances became a fertile soil for armed clashes between
Fatah's and Hamas's activists in the occupied territories, reaching sporadic
armed clashes in Tul Karm and Gaza. In September 1990, at the initiative
of leading MB figures in Jordan, Hamas and Fatah agreed on a "Charter of
Honor" which recognized Hamas' legitimate existence as an equal and independent
faction, with both signatories undertaking to refrain from hostilities.
The agreement meant to put an end to the immediate origins of the Fatah-Hamas
clashes, mainly the former's veto on participation of Hamas in the prisoners'
committees. Although the agreement paid lip service to the principle that
"Islam is deeply-rooted in us, it is our principle as Muslims, and way
of our life," the main bones of political contention between Fatah and
Hamas namely, the latter's independence and growing challenge to the PLO
authority, remained intact.<A HREF="#c9">9</A>
<P>Hamas successes notwithstanding, it could not overlook the PLO's pressure
to join the over-all Palestinian national organization as one of its factions.
In April 1990, following the approach of the PNC's Chairman, Shaikh 'Abd
al-Hamid al-Sa'ih, Hamas applied to the PNC to participate in the PLO.
However, afraid of being co-opted and manipulated by Fatah, Hamas demanded
general elections among all the Palestinians both in the homeland and the
diaspora for the PNC. If the circumstances would not allow such elections,
Hamas insisted to be allotted at least 40 percents of the PNC seats, based
on its proven electoral power in elections to public institutions in the
occupied territories. In addition, Hamas demanded changes in the Palestinian
National Charter, rejection of any political negotiations with Israel and
adoption of the Jihad as a sole means to liberate Palestine. Hamas also
demanded proportionate financial allocations and incorporation of its own
representatives in the PLO's bureaucracy.
<P>Hamas' demands reflected a claim for equal weight to Fatah which would
abolish its unchallenged domination in the PLO. At the least, it was to
provide Hamas a veto power on the PLO's decision-making, which explains
Arafat's rejection of Hamas' demands, and alternative offer of no more
than 20 percents. The contention over Hamas' participation in the PLO had
remained unresolved until the Madrid peace conference in October 1991 when
the issue was effectively dropped from the agenda. In the debate between
the two movements, the PLO--effectively Fatah-- presented its relations
with Hamas in terms of state vis-a-vis a splinter group that rebelled against
the state's legitimacy. The PLO, according to Fatah, was the Palestinian
homeland, entity and state, thus, it was above any partisan debate. It
was legitimate to criticize Fatah but not the PLO, which was tantamount
to heresy (<I>ridda</I>), the latter maintained.<A HREF="#c10">10</A>
<P>Responding to Fatah's campaign against its refusal to join the PLO as
one of its factions, Hamas' argumentation combined pragmatic and ideological
principles. Hamas referred to democratic principles, expressing willingness
to respect a majority decision of the Palestinian people. Following the
PLO's consent to Palestinian participation in the Madrid peace conference,
Hamas claimed that the majority of the Palestinians rejected the "conference
of wholesale of the land, denying the PLO's legitimacy to represent the
Palestinian people. Such legitimacy, Hamas reiterated, could be attained
only on the basis of "Islamization" of the PLO's political program namely,
the unconditional return to the armed struggle until the liberation of
the whole Palestinian land.<A HREF="#c11">11</A>
<P>Toward the end of the year 1992 the PLO-Hamas relationship reached the
lowest ebb as Arafat demonstrated growing rudeness in his attacks and humiliating
expressions against Hamas. Apart from devaluating Hamas' gains in the elections
to public institutions in the West Bank and Gaza Arafat endeavored to delegitimize
his rival movement, suggesting that its close collaboration with Iran run
against the principle of independent Palestinian decision-making, and accusing
Hamas of serving Iranian foreign interests.<A HREF="#c12">l2</A> Apart
from aggravating the conflict with the PLO, Hamas' alliance with Iran deepened
the discontent within the movement's leadership between two currents. A
minority trend, apparently represented by the "inside" leadership, advocated
Palestinization of the movement, cessation of the armed struggle, focusing
on overt and peaceful effort which would protect Hamas from the Israeli
repression and exempt it from the need to ally with the PLO as a shield.
The majority current, however, representing primarily the "outside" leadership,
sought to Islamize the Palestinian conflict with Israel through alliance
with other Islamic movements, especially with Iran. The proponents of this
policy presented Hamas as the true representative of the Palestinian people,
and thus as a moral and political alternative to the PLO whose collapse
they perceived only a matter of time.<A HREF="#c13">13</A>
<P>On December 17 1992, the PLO was confronted by a new political dilemma
when Israel deported 415 Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists to south Lebanon,
following the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli Border Guard soldier.
It was the largest deportation of Palestinians from the occupied territories
Israel had undertaken ever since 1967. Among the deportees were Hamas'
top leaders as well as the backbone of the movement's political, educational
and religious activists in the occupied territories, apparently none with
military affiliation or record. The unprecedented Israeli measure backfired
almost immediately, demonstrating the limits of the attempt to eliminate
the movement's civic and political basis.
<P>Although the mass deportation temporarily paralyzed Hamas, it boosted
the movement's prestige in the Palestinian public opinion. The public urge
to resume the PLO-Hamas dialogue found Hamas in a perceived favorable position
vis-a-vis the PLO, stating that a unified Palestinian position can only
be possible the PLO corrected its mistake by withdrawing from the Madrid
negotiations. Hamas' position on this issue was presented as "clear and
non-negotiable." The deportation triggered an ad-hoc agreement between
all leading military organizations operating in the field--Fatah's Hawks,
the Red Eagles, and Battalions of 'lzz al-Din al-Qassam-to cooperate militarily
in operations against Israel. The effective pressure exerted by Hamas,
the deportees' family members, and public opinion, on the Palestinian delegates
to the peace talks and the PLO's leadership all but committed the latter
to proclaim the renewal of the talks---which had been adjourned for Christmas
break conditional on the return of the deportees, a victory for Hamas which
neither Israel nor the PLO had desired.<A HREF="#c14">14</A>

<P>Despite manifestations of Palestinian solidarity with the deported Islamists,
the Israeli reaction confronted Hamas with a dilemma in the context of
its relations with the PLO. Hamas' appeal to the Arab and international
community in the name of human rights and Palestinian legitimacy meant
recognition of those circles supporting Israel or strongly advocating the
peace process. At the same time, the deportation gave the PLO an opportunity
to champion the international diplomatic campaign against Israel in an
attempt to force the Rabin government to allow the return of the deportees
to their homes, highlighting its role as the representative of all the
Palestinians, no matter their ideological or political affiliation. It
is against this backdrop that the PLO called Hamas for a meeting in Tunis
immediately after the deportation, the gist of which was to coopt Hamas
into the PLO's efforts on behalf of the deportees as step toward Hamas'
full incorporation in the PLO. The dilemma confronted by Hamas was clearly
indicated by its uneasy acceptance of the PLO's call and insistence on
receiving a written invitation, denoting recognition, from Arafat himself
before sending its delegates to Tunis.<A HREF="#c15">15</A>

<P>The December 1992 Tunis talks were marked by the dialogue of the deaf
as each side repeated its own agenda, leaving their differences as unresolved
as ever. Aside from the return of the deportees, Hamas repeated its claims
for the PLO's withdrawal from the peace talks and escalation of the <I>Intifada</I>
and armed struggle within the occupied territories, on which it gained
the PFLP and DFLP delegates' support. Arafat firmly rejected Hamas demand
to withdraw from the peace negotiations. While avoiding the call for escalating
the armed struggle, Arafat repeated his offer to Hamas to join the PLO
as the second largest faction in the PNC. Hamas' delegation expressed no
more than willingness to learn Arafat's proposals.
<P>Hamas' unprecedented participation in the PLO's leadership meeting at
its headquarters in Tunis---despite internal reluctance and Iranian discontent-seemed
tantamount to a tacit recognition of the PLO's status as the sole representative
of the Palestinian people, and of Arafat's legitimate leadership. Indeed,
Hamas' decision to attend the Tunis talks obviously represented consideration
of its "inside" infrastructure's needs and wish to accept Arafat's extended
hand. However, while Hamas gave its consent to continue the dialogue with
Fatah in Khartoum in early January 1993, its political leadership remained
as firm as before regarding its conditions for cooperation with the PLO.<A HREF="#c16">16</A>

<P>Hamas made its participation in the PLO conditional on comprehensive
reorganization of the PNC and the PLO which would give the former veto
power on their political decisions. Despite the failure of Fatah and Hamas
to reach a political agreement, the tension between the two movements,
mainly in the Gaza Strip, continued to nourish both occasional violence
and efforts to come to terms on avoiding them. Even before the signing
of the Oslo agreement, rumors about possible unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from the Gaza Strip led Hamas to seek an agreement with the PLO, apparently
in order to prevent the use of force by Fatah Hawks against its active
members.<A HREF="#c17">l7</A>

<P>On the day the Declaration of Principles (DOP) was signed in Washington,
Hamas issued a statement expressing its "complete rejection ... of the
'Gaza-Jericho First' for its conclusion of dangerous concessions, its total
departure from national and legal norms and its outright transgression
of the red lines agreed upon by the Palestinian National Council in successive
sessions... an accord that brings only limited and fragmented self-administration
in Gaza and Jericho, representing affront to our honor, a denial of our
sacrifices and years of struggle, and a violation of our established historical
rights to the land of Palestine."<A HREF="#c18">18</A> Yet despite its
urge to continue the armed struggle against Israel, Hamas manifested its
pragmatic approach by restricting its response toward the future Palestinian
self-governing authority, issuing decisive instructions to prevent infighting,
and keeping open channels to Fatah.<A HREF="#c19">19</A>

<P><A NAME="dialogue"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Inconclusive Post-Oslo Dialogue</B></FONT>
<BR>The Oslo agreement put Hamas in quandary. Hamas was aware that a new
situation had emerged in which the Islamic movement would have to confront
both Israel and the PLO if it were to adhere to its political principles.
According to this logic, all out confrontation would preserve the movement's
principles and militant image but would risk its very existence. Most dangerous
yet, a confrontation could erode Hamas' capability to underwrite its social
and economic services to the community, perceived crucial to maintain its
popular influence.

<P>A "successful" Jihad, that is, one which would bring to an end the peace
process, would certainly aggravate the socio-economic predicament of the
Palestinian society--for which Hamas would be blamed--and lead to alienation
from Hamas. On the other hand, cooperation with the PLO would entail a
danger of "divide and rule" and cooptation of segments of the movement's
leadership into the system, and loss of Hamas' bargaining position toward
Israel and the PLO.
<P>With the establishment of the PNA in June 1994, Hamas' dilemma further
aggravated. The formation of a centralized authority by Arafat was saliently
embodied by the establishment of large police and security forces. in addition,
Arafat maintained a growing control of financial flow into the West Bank
and Gaza, control of the media, and established growing collaboration with
Israeli authorities on intelligence and security matters. The speedy process
of establishing the PNA's means of power enhanced its capability to mobilize
public support and limit the opportunities of action by the Islamic movement.<A HREF="#c20">20</A>
It is this institutionalization of the PNA that increased Hamas' awareness
of the need to search for a new working formula that would bridge the gap
between its ideology and the dramatically changing reality. Similarly to
Shaikh Yasin's early statements during the <I>Intifada</I>, Hamas manifested
sensitivity to and awareness of practical considerations of "here and now"
that made all the more realistic an indirect dialogue with Israel.

<P>The main considerations in favor of a pragmatic approach had been succinctly
explained by Musa Abu Marzuq, head of the movement's Political Bureau,
shortly before the Calm agreement on implementation of Palestinian autonomy
in Gaza and Jericho.<A HREF="#c21">21</A> Abu Marzuq expressed concern
at the ensuing agreement between Israel and the PLO, pointing to three
major threats that Hamas' continued intransigence toward the current process
entailed:
<UL>
<LI>
A threat to Hamas' presence in Jordan, the "second arena of action after
Palestine," due to joint Israeli and American pressures.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
A growing negative perception of Hamas in the international arena, as a
murderous and terrorist movement that targets civilians.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Exposure of Hamas to domestic Palestinian criticism due to the absence
of a positive alternative strategy to the peace process.</LI>
</UL>
According to Abu Marzuq, Hamas' difficulty to cope effectively with these
threats derived from:
<UL>
<LI>
Identity of interests between the US, Israel, Jordan and the PLO. Additionally,
most Arab states and the international community support the peace process
and agree that Hamas constitutes the main threat to its success.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Hamas' military inferiority vis-a-vis the PNA's police and security agencies.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Hamas infrastructure's dependence on external financial resources, which
can be easily affected through the PNA's legislation and administrative
restrictions.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Indeed, the advent of the PNA in Gaza downsized Hamas to a second-class
party after a long period of enjoying control of the street and enforcing
its rules. Despite all its pitfalls, the Oslo process gained, especially
during the first eighteen months, public appreciation at its both collective
achievements as well as its rewards to certain groups.

<P>Growing groups of bureaucrats employed by the PNA and entrepreneurs
emerged, interested in preserving the economic benefits of work for the
PNA as well as of those working in Israel or with Israelis. Hamas was also
aware of the strong international and regional support that the Oslo process
gained, turning any attempt to wreck it tantamount to a "political illusion."
Furthermore, Hamas' leaders expressed awareness of the world and regional
trends regarding the Islamic movements that had been forced to take a defensive
position almost in all the Arab countries. Hamas lacked strategic depth
or support also within the Palestinians: its supporters in the territories
have been in a minority; the Islamic movement in Israel was closer to Arafat
than to Hamas, and even the Islamic movement in Jordan was strictly under
control of the Jordanian regime.<A HREF="#c22">22</A>
<P><A NAME="restraint"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Toward a Strategy of Mutual
Restraint</B></FONT>
<BR>The relations with Hamas had obviously been high on the PNA's agenda
since its signing of the DOP in September 1993. Yet despite 'Arafat's attempts
to enlist leading MB figures in Egypt to incorporate Hamas (and the Islamic
Jihad as well) to the PNA's institutions, the latter remained adamant not
to accept less than official status that would secure its uninterrupted
development under the PNA. The violent clash of November 18, 1994 between
a PNA police force which opened fire at Hamas rioting worshipers following
the Friday prayer in Filastin Mosque of Gaza, confronted the Islamists
in the Gaza Strip with an unprecedented reality. It was a demonstration
of the PNA's enhanced self-confidence and determination to use its armed
power to enforce its authority. Yet both sides demonstrated restraint,
with Hamas expressing willingness to open a dialogue with the PNA. Pointing
to Israel as the cause to the violent clash between them, and to common
concerns such as "the homeland, Jerusalem, the [Palestinian] prisoners
[Jewish] settlements," provided both the PNA and Hamas a pretext to rid
themselves of the embarrassment and demonstrate unity.

<P>Indeed, the fear of being shunned aside by the PNA urged elements within
Hamas to advocate participation in the emerging Palestinian bureaucracy
and elections to the PNA Council. Adversely, antagonists raised arguments
that emphasized the movement's authenticity and adherence to original goals
as a shield from erosion and containment by the central authority. Hamas'
vacillation between these two approaches has been clearly reflected in
its leadership's debate over means and strategies ever since September
1993.
<P>The cumulative effect of the internal debate within Hamas indicated
its growing tendency to discern between an attitude toward the "objective"
namely, Israel, and the perception of actual situations.<A HREF="#c23">23</A>
On the declarative level, expressed toward the objective, Hamas adhered
to its intransigent rejection of Israel's legitimacy, maintaining that
the solution to the conflict is a Palestinian Islamic state "from the river
to the sea," that is, Palestine in its Mandatory borders. Yet strictly
adhering to this attitude could paralyze Hamas' political maneuverability
and force it to fight the PNA or give away its claim to provide an alternative
normative and political frame of reference to the existing order. It is
here where the attitude to "actual situations," revealing political realism
and recognition of practical constraints which led Hamas to express willingness
to adopt the traditional Islamic concept of truce (<U>hudna</U>) with the
infidels, in return to a Palestinian state on part of historic Palestine.
Under such terms, a dialogue with Israel was not precluded by Hamas political
leadership.<A HREF="#c24">24</A>

<P>

<P>By interpreting any political agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
as merely a pause on the historic road of Jihad, Hamas achieved political
flexibility without loosing its ideological credibility. Having adopted
the strategy of phases, Hamas was ready to acquiesce in the Oslo process
without recognizing Israel; to support the establishment of a Palestinian
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip without ending the state of war or
renounce its ultimate goals, to consider restrain, but not to give up the
armed struggle, relating it to uncontrolled groups, making a distinction
between "political" and "military" wings within the movement, or claiming
the right to launch operations from areas under Israel's rule.

<P>Hamas' willingness to acquiesce in a political settlement with Israel
on a temporary basis, that is, without compromising its ultimate goals,
enabled it to consolidate a working formula of coexistence with the PNA.
This inclination was expressed in establishing joint ad hoc conciliation
forums with Fatah as well as committees on national concerns such as the
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas' willingness to maintain a
negotiated coexistence with the PNA was reciprocated by the latter on grounds
of cost benefit calculations despite Arafat's efforts to weaken, divide,
and coopt Hamas into its authority, his cautious policy has also reflected
preference of dialogue over head-on collision. Since neither could sustain
the price of full-fledged attempt to eliminate the other, both sides preferred
cautious acquiescence in the other's existence, refraining from risking
their public legitimacy in case of a major showdown. It was more promising
for each side to concentrate on improving its positions and to beef up
its bargaining ability vis-a-vis the other side, instead of pursuing an
"all or nothing" policy to advance ultimate political goals.

Participation</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Hamas' approach of neither full acceptance of the PNA's legitimacy nor
its total rejection has been apparent in the movement's internal debate
and actual behavior concerning the issue of participation in the PNA's
executive and representative institutions. Hamas' need to ensure its survivability
and continued growth made necessary access to power and resources. On the
other hand, Hamas had vested interest to minimize the damage to its political
stature as a result of its participation in the PNA, which might be interpreted
as deviation from core Islamic values.

<P>Much of Hamas' approach towards this issue can be described in terms
of a differentiation between participation through direct and official
presence and participation through political involvement in the PNA's representative
and decision-making institutions. Taking into account Hamas' refusal to
recognize the PNA, an involvement in its acting administrative apparatuses
without an official presence and direct representation would provide useful
means to minimize the disadvantages of the existing post-Oslo processes
without paying the political cost of its endorsement. Moreover, involvement
would serve as a safety valve for Hamas, reducing the threats to its continued
activity and public support.

<P>Yet involvement without an official presence entails a great uncertainty:
it may provide political safety in the short-run, but it is exposed to
threats of instability in the long-run. Presence, on the other hand, increases
stability and continuity of resource allocation for the long run but it
may lead to a renouncement or reduction to a minimum Hamas' public rejection
of Oslo and legitimization of the political and legal status of the PNA.
Given the growing conviction among both Palestinian and Israelis that the
Oslo process is irreversible, the more the PNA tightens its grip on the
society, the more intense becomes the debate within Hamas regarding participation
in the PNA's executive institutions. It is here one should look in order
to understand how Hamas tried to cope with the dilemma of participation
by adopting a strategy which combined elements of political involvement
with mechanisms of indirect presence. Nowhere has this strategy of participation
found better expression than in the issue of the general elections to the
PNA's Council, the issue of incorporation to the PNA's administration,
and the establishment of political party to run in the elections.

<P><A NAME="pna"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Participation Through Unofficial
Presence: Elections to the PNA's Council</B></FONT>
<BR>Hamas as a movement could not exceed its own barrier and participate
in the Palestinian general elections which were perceived by many locals
as well as by foreign observers as a vote of faith in the Oslo accords.
The elections took place on January 20, 1996, in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank (including the Palestinians of East Jerusalem). The elections
were based on the DOP of September 13, 1993, (known as Oslo 1) and on the
September 1995 Israeli-Palestinian agreement (known as Oslo 2). According
to the Interim agreement:

<P>1. in order to enable the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip to govern themselves in keeping with democratic principles,
general, direct and free political elections will be held for the Council,
under agreed-upon international supervision: the Palestinian police will
care for public order.

<P>2. The parties will reach an agreement upon the definite form of the
elections and its conditions... in order to hold the elections within a
period which shall not be more than nine months after the Agreement of
Principles goes into effect.

<P>3. These elections will be an important preparatory step towards the
attainment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and its just
demands.<A HREF="#d1">1</A>

<P>In accordance with the interim agreement, elections for the president
of the PNA were held simultaneously with those for the members of the Palestinian
council, using separate ballots. Participation was open to all Palestinians,
18 years of age and above, who lived in their electoral district and whose
names were on the voters' rolls. Candidacy for membership in the Assembly
was open to every Palestinian who was 30 years of age or older on election
day.

<P>Election of the members of the Council took place through regional elections,
with the voters voting personally and directly for the candidates who had
presented candidacies in their district. Even in cases where the candidate
was presented by a party list, or a joint ad hoc list formed for the elections,
the voter could indicate the candidate he or she preferred among those
on the list. Every voter had the right to vote for a number of candidates
equal to the number of seats allotted to the district, and was allowed
to support candidates from different lists. The winning candidates were
those who received the largest number of votes in the polls.

<P>Though the elections were personal, as voters elected candidates individually
by name and not as part of a list of candidates, the system permitted movements,
parties, and individuals to organize and present joint lists from which
the voter could choose the candidates he or she preferred. Of the 725 candidates,
559 were independent candidates, who ran on the basis of their previous
activities, personal wealth, or their relationship to one of the larger
clans in a specific district. One hundred sixty-six candidates were represented
on electoral lists, 36 of them on new lists that had been established as
the elections approached, and 130 represented pre-existing movements and
parties.<A HREF="#d2">2</A>

<P>Hamas' position regarding the elections was tightly linked to two main
issues: First, the political program of the PNA, that is, the grand policy
with which Hamas would be identified by virtue participating in elections
that were bound to legitimize the PNA and implicitly the principles of
the DOP. Second, Hamas prospects to play a significant political role within
the PNA. While Hamas adhered to its fierce rejection of the "shameful and
humiliating accord," it effectively gave the impression that the debate
within the movement had remained undecided or that it deliberately meant
to keep all options open to ensure maximum benefit from future opportunities.
despite an initial decision to boycott the elections, Shaikh Yasin announced
shortly afterwards that Hamas would possibly participate in the elections,
but not if they were to legitimize the PNA which was not recognized or
supported by Hamas.<A HREF="#d3">3</A>

<P>Yasin's statement reflected a broadly supported position within Hamas
local constituency. Participation, according to this position, was the
lesser evil and could serve as a guarantee against an attempt to eliminate
Hamas under circumstances of strong domestic and international support
for the PNA. Yet an opposite viewpoint maintained that such participation
would cost Hamas a loss of credibility and would be tantamount to political
suicide as it would blur the dividing lines between Hamas and the PNA.
Worse, it might denote acceptance of the Oslo process by Hamas.<A HREF="#d4">4</A>

<P>By and large, the pros and cons were divided along regional lines. Due
to the PNA's tighter control of Gaza Strip, Hamas leaders there were relatively
more favorable to the participation in the elections compared to the West
Bankers. It is also this Gaza leadership which revealed willingness to
enter into negotiations with the PNA over this issue, without consent of
the outside leadership. In addition to the regional division, differences
within Hamas apparently derived from socio-economic gaps as well. In the
Hamas-PNA meeting in Khartoum in early November 1995 the former's delegates,
all from the autonomous Palestinian areas, were not conspicuous political
leaders in Hamas but in fact loose members, representing a wealthy group
of merchants in the movement. They expressed positive attitude toward participation
in the elections, contrary to many of Hamas leading figures, especially
outside the autonomy territory, as well as rank and file, who identified
the elections with the Oslo accords.<A HREF="#d5">5</A>

<P>In late October 1995, following the release of Hamas prisoners, a leading
supporter of Hamas' participation in the elections explained that the movement's
eventual decision would be conditional on certain assurances: "We want
to be convinced that any Palestinian parliament will be free. The elections
must be independently planned and formulated by the Palestinians without
any Israeli interference. And we insist that all unresolved questions must
be up for discussion - though we refuse, by any way, any Israeli preconditions
on the status of Jerusalem.<A HREF="#d6">6</A>

<P>In mid-November Hamas announced its official decision to boycott the
elections to the PNA Council, though not actively, explaining that the
movement was not against the principle of elections but against the dissatisfactory
terms of the Oslo accords, especially Israel's insufficient withdrawal
from the occupied territories and the inadequacy of the election law. However,
Hamas made it clear that its boycott was not meant to prevent indirect
participation, stating that "we have repeated the call to our members and
to adherents of the Islamic block to register their names on the electoral
roll."<A HREF="#d7">7</A>

<P>Hamas' decision to refrain from official participation in the elections
remained unchanged in the talks held in Cairo between its delegates and
the PNA representatives. Hamas' attitude represented a long and indecisive
debate with which the movement's leadership had been entangled since the
Oslo agreement, and the weakening of the Islamic block following eighteen
months of PNA rule. Apart from Hamas' proclaimed reasons for boycotting
the elections there was the continued imprisonment of the movement's leaders,
including Yasin and Rantisi (by Israel), and Abu Marzuq (by the US Government),
which a priori strengthened the militant voice of the outside leadership.

<P>Hamas, however, called on its followers to fulfill their individual
right to vote for Muslim candidates who had been associated or maintained
good relations with it. This motion represented realistic approach, recognizing
the strong public excitement about fulfilling this unprecedented roll.
Under these circumstances, if it called for a boycott and people voted
anyway, it would lose all esteem. Furthermore, the registration lists for
the general elections were to be used to determine the eligible electorate
for the future municipal elections in which Hamas would be sure to take
part officially, as it had no implications on the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process. Like the Palestinian Islamic movement in Israel and in some of
the neighboring Arab countries, Hamas was fully aware of the opportunity
to have an official representation in the PNA Council by committed Islamist
individuals, thus preserving the ideological image of Hamas intact.

<P>By adopting a strategy of participation through unofficial presence
in the elections Hamas was able to urge its supporters to take part in
the elections and to help the arriving to the ballots. Hamas effectively
led its followers to vote for the seven candidates whom the movement was
eager to support as close adherents and of whom six were elected. Also,
Hamas supported several independents, and even a number of Fatah candidates
known for their good relations with the Islamic opposition.<A HREF="#d8">8</A>
The strategy of participation through unofficial presence also dictated
Hamas' behavior on incorporation of its members in the PNA's executive
apparatuses. Similarly to its attitude toward participation in the elections,
Hamas encouraged its adherents to join personally the PNA's administrative
organizations. Hamas justified this motion by discerning between two perceptions
of the PNA namely, as a sovereign political power, and as an administrative
apparatus designated to provide services to the populace. While the former
represented political principles and national symbols, the latter was perceived
instrumental, linked to reality.

<P>From the outset, Hamas' position toward the PNA's institutions was marked
by an attempt to differentiate between the political and the executive
levels. Thus, while Hamas' line of propaganda elaborated on ways of discreditation
and delegitimization of the PNA's leadership, it was cautious not to alienate
the rank and file within the PNA administration. This approach and the
PNA's anticipated policy of preferring coexistence over confrontation with
Hamas, brought the latter already in October 1993 to instruct its adherents
to refrain from creating a hostile atmosphere against the Palestinian police
officers. On the contrary, these policeofficers were to be encouraged to
collaborate with Hamas armed activities against Israel and even to "initiate
suicidal actions ... exploiting their possibilities of [available] weapons,
and freedom of maneuver to support the resistance."<A HREF="#d9">9</A>
Hamas encouraged its members to fill official positions in the religious
establishment in the West Bank, explaining that these positions had been
administrative, providing services to the community, without representative
significance.<A HREF="#d10">10</A> Thus, by reducing the significance of
participation in the PNA's administration to the individual level and executive
aspects, Hamas could benignly portray such participation as unofficial,
with no political or symbolic meaning. "If the Islamists [directly] participate
in the government it would mean that they have become part of it, and would
not be able to return to the slogan that Islam is the solution."<A HREF="#d11">11</A>

<P><A NAME="proxy"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Presence Through Proxy: Establishing
a Political Party</B></FONT>
<BR>The initiative of establishing a political party began looming in Hamas
circles in September 1993, with the earliest rumors about the anticipated
agreement between Israel and the PLO. According to one of the figures who
stood behind this idea, Fakhri 'Abd al-latif, the Oslo agreement obliged
Hamas to consider a new political strategy in which a legal party could
better serve the Islamic movement's interests and preserve its achievements.<A HREF="#d12">12</A>

<P>The party was not meant to replace Hamas and its armed struggle against
Israel but rather to attain three main goals:
<UL>A. Providing a countrywide political umbrella for those Palestinians
who identify themselves with the Islamic vision. As such, the Islamic party
was to focus on general Islamist values and goals, primarily the establishment
of an Islamic state in Palestine, without including antagonideological
elements toward Israel. Such a party could attract wider circles than strictly
those supporting Hamas. The Islamic party was meant to play a pivotal role
in the relations between the public and the PNA, and to work in coexistence
with the latter in order to erode the "negative effects" of the accords
with Israel; to build a civic society, base on the Islamic law (shari'a),
providing social and economic services to the public.

<P>B. Ridding Hamas of the dilemma which it had been confronted by the
elections. Hamas could neither participate in the elections nor boycott
them without paying a political price. While participation meant an indirect
legitimization of the Oslo process and harm to the movement's ideological
reputation, boycott of the elections meant political isolation, and loss
of influence on future relations between the PNA and Israel. The party
could legitimize the Oslo process without "staining" Hamas or directly
committing it to the party's platform and policies.

<P>C. Serving as a major political framework for participation in elections
to public organizations, such as municipal government, trade unions, and
professional associations. Given its reputable record in providing communal
services Hamas leaders expected to gain wide public support especially
in the elections to local government. Taking over the sphere of local government
was particularly attractive as it has been perceived as involving no essential
significance such as shaping the basic ideas and values of the Palestinian
state to be and its future relations with Israel. Thus, according to one
of Hamas' leaders, Mahmud al-Zahar, an establishment of a political party
and its participation in the elections for the Palestinian council would
not legitimize the PNA just as Hamas' previous participation in elections
of professional and social associations had not legitimized the Israeli
occupation.<A HREF="#d13">13</A></UL>


<P>Although the initiative of establishing an Islamic party faced objection
from Hamas' outside leaders (who had been waging a power struggle with
the PNA), in mid-November 1995, Arafat confirmed the foundation of The
National Islamic Salvation <I>Party (hizb al-khalas al-watani al-islami</I>).
Following the announcement, Arafat met with its registered founders who
were all well known figures in the Gaza Strip. The founders announced that
they were not linked to any existing political body. The new party's spokesman,
Fakhri 'Abd al-Latif, admitted that the party and Hamas derived from the
same ideas. Yet, each of them was structurally independent. He also revealed
that the new party's political bureau was comprised of members of Hamas
though this was not the case with all the founders.<A HREF="#d14">14</A>

<P>A month before the elections the new party still had not officially
announced its participation, apparently because of the delay in the political
talks between Hamas and the PNA. Other reasons underpinning the reluctance
to participate in the elections, apart from the rejection of the Oslo accord,
were the party's unreadiness for the elections and insufficient time for
preparations, and the limited power allotted to the Council. At a massive
rally in Gaza on its eighth anniversary, in mid-December 1995, Hamas's
leaders officially announced that the movement would not take part in the
elections on grounds that the "Oslo elections" would not guarantee the
Palestinian rights for sovereignty and a state for the Palestinian people.
Yet they repeated their commitment to avoid infighting and contribute its
share to the building of a civic and secured society, through dialogue
with the PNA. Hamas decision not to participate in the elections was announced
again at the Cairo talks, yet it was implied that candidates identified
with Hamas-understood as the newly established National Islamic Salvation
Party--would take part.<A HREF="#d15">15</A>

<P>With the closing of registration of candidates to the elections, it
was clear that the National Islamic Salvation Party would not take an official
part in the elections, leaving the arena to Fatah and its two marginal
political partners: the People's Party (previously the Communist Party)
and FDA (Palestinian Democratic Union).

<P>Analytically speaking the abstention of the Islamic party from participation
in the elections derived from a combination of internal and external causes.
Certainly the timing and system of the elections were designed to provide
Arafat an advantage. These circumstances apparently provided Hamas' "outside"
leadership with strong pretext to reject participation of an Islamic party
in the elections, beyond its initial concern lest such participation would
strengthen the "inside" leadership. Furthermore, given the symbolic significance
of the elections, the anticipation of decisive victory of Arafat and Fatah
would have present Hamas as a marginal movement. Such a victory could diminish
Hamas' bargaining position with the PNA, and encourage the latter to take
further steps to reduce Hamas' public influence.

<P>Huntington distinguishes three methods by which a regime can manipulate
an election so as to favor itself; by setting the timing of the elections;
by establishing electoral systems highly favorable to itself, harassing
and intimidating the opposition, and employing government resources in
the campaign; and by outright fraud and theft.<A HREF="#d16">16</A> In
recent Palestinian elections, Arafat engaged in at least the first two,
if not all three of these techniques.<A HREF="#d17">17</A> Arafat appointed
his long-time confidant and Fatah member Sa'ib 'Ariqat to head the Central
Election Commission that was to pass the electoral law and oversee the
elections. The commission set the election date for January 20, the day
before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. If the elections
were held after Ramadan, Hamas would have had a chance to reach the masses
through the daily prayers but mainly through its the charity and welfare
committees which would encourage them to vote for the Islamic Party. Thus,
the Palestinian vote serves as a good example of how the elections may
be strategically set for the benefit of one party.<A HREF="#d18">18</A>
In addition, the Legislative Council of the 88 members was elected through
majoritarian first-past-the-post elections in 16 districts. Three districts
were single member, while 13 were multimember. Six seats were reserved
for Christian candidates and one for a Samaritan candidate. Candidates
could run as individuals or as members of a party, though voters could
split their tickets across parties. Voters were allotted an equal number
of votes as slots from their district. For example, a voter in Gaza City
had 12 votes, each of which he was to designate for one candidate, and
he could choose to divide his vote among candidates from different parties.
With polls a month before the election showing Fatah running at 40-45%
and Hamas at 15%.<A HREF="#d19">19</A> Arafat must have known that a majoritarian
system would greatly favor his party. If the polls were correct, a proportional
system would have required Arafat to share power with 13 or so Islamic
Council members. Moreover, employing multi-member districts further favored
Arafat party since, as Lijphart writes,

<P>All majoritarian systems tend to systematically favor the larger parties,
to produce disproportional election outcomes, and to discourage multipartism.
District magnitudes larger than .. tend to reinforce these tendencies.<A HREF="#d20">20</A>
Indeed, as early as November, Islamist leader Jamal Salim argued, "because
it is based on a system of majority rule, and not proportional representation,
the system will effectively exclude a large number of popular political
forces from participating."<A HREF="#d21">21</A>

<P>Not only did the electoral system itself benefit Arafat, but so did
the conduct of the campaign. The Central Election Commission was appointed
only a few weeks before the vote, and it announced new arrangements up
to the last few days. Even the district boundaries were in flux up to the
last moments.<A HREF="#d22">22</A> Furthermore, the official campaign period
was reduced to just over two weeks from the planned 22 days, a measly amount
of time for an election in which 725 candidates ran for office. One of
the only well-known campaign rules was that political speeches forbidden
in mosques, a clear attempt to hinder Hamas' chances of success if it decided
to participate.<A HREF="#d23">23</A> There were also reports Palestinian
police patrolled the streets at night tearing down posters for any non-Fatah
candidates.<A HREF="#d24">24</A> Some observers noted that if all these
advantages were not enough, the presence of at least three PNA policemen
at every polling station would probably help persuade Palestinians to vote
for Arafat and Fatah.<A HREF="#d25">25</A>

<P>The absence of Hamas-based Islamic party in the elections might indicate
the major considerations determining Hamas' political behavior in the context
of political participation in PNA institutions. The fear lest a rejection
of any cooperation with the PNA would cause the movement an irreversible
damage and that participation might be interpreted as an act of legitimization
of the Oslo process, obliged Hamas to opt for unofficial participation.
Such mode of participation was subject to three considerations:
<UL>
<LI>
Whether it might produce a positive result for Hamas, or at least a tolerable
one which would secure its achievements and bargaining position.</LI>

<LI>
The extent of being perceived as an instrumental act with significance
of recognition of the</LI>

<LI>
PNA.</LI>

<LI>
The probability of winning the support of the movement's leadership, both
"inside" and "outside" the homeland.</LI>
</UL>
It is here one should look to understand Hamas' decision to encourage its
adherents to vote in the elections and support the candidates identified
with Hamas as individuals, not as members of a party. In the same vein,
Hamas encouraged its members to join the PNA's executive instruments, but
not to fill any position with political significance. In both cases the
chance of scoring gains without paying a tangible in symbolic terms seemed
possible and the likelihood of an accord, or consent, on Hamas leadership'
"inside" and "outside", were perceived high.

<CENTER><A NAME="adjustment"></A><FONT SIZE=+2><B>The Politics of Adjustment:
Opportunities and Constraints</B></FONT></CENTER>


<P>Politics of adjustment became the main feature of Hamas' political conduct.
Strategies of controlled violence, negotiated coexistence and calculated
participation, all reflected Hamas' effort to avoid decision over its conflicting
commitments to all-Islamic and Palestinian national ideology, and to communal
interests of survival as a social and political movement. While the former
commitment determined a strategy of confrontation with Israel, the PLO
and the PNA, the latter obliged Hamas to undertake adjustment to the changing
of circumstances, and acquiescence in the political reality.

<P>Hamas' strategies represented a balance based on neither full acceptance
nor total rejection of the political order emanating from the Israeli-Palestinian
Oslo accords and the establishment of the PNA. While Hamas refused to officially
recognize the basic assumptions and consequences of the peace process it
practically refrained from total confrontation with the emerging new political
order created by the PNA- Israeli diplomacy. While Hamas' discourse represents
a growing tendency to entrench in its ideological premises and long-term
goal of establishing an alternative social and moral order, it demonstrated
a de-facto acquiescence with the current political circumstances. And while
Hamas strives to preserve its image as a highly doctrinaire and activist
movement, it demonstrated awareness to the changing circumstances and considerable
ability to adjust itself to the new reality. Thus, Hamas continued to adhere
to the armed struggle as the sole strategy of national liberation from
the Israeli occupation, without precluding the possibility of its indirect
incorporation in the new Palestinian political order. Hamas refused to
accord legitimacy to the PNA and yet recognized it as a <I>fait accompli</I>;
it rejected Israel's right of existence and yet manifested pragmatism by
willingness to tolerate coexistence based on temporary settlements. 
<P>In a cost-benefit analysis Hamas' politics of adjustment carried discernible
advantages at a minimum organizational and ideological price. The politics
of adjustment protected Hamas from being marginalized as a result of a
dogmatic adherence to maximalist goals, ignoring the far reaching changes
Israel Palestinian relations. At the same time, it prevented a head-on
collision with Israel and the PNA which could have brought to the movement
demise. Indeed, in Hamas' viewpoint there have been enough incentives to
adhere to the strategy of political adjustment.

<P>Yet however persuasive the argument for preserving its pragmatic modes
of action is, one cannot exclude the possibility that under certain circumstances
Hamas may adopt a policy of confrontation with either or both Israel Hamas
might adhere to its pragmatic and the PNA. To what extent might turn to
intransigent violence? Apart from the surrounding circumstances, this question
must examine Hamas' structural features and organizational tenets which
effected its modes of political thinking, shaped its conduct, and influenced
Hamas' strategic choices.

<P><A NAME="strategies"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Strategies of Action and Structural
Features</B></FONT>
<BR>Hamas' ability to adopt pragmatic strategies of political adjustment
was due to its ability to bridge the gap between contradicting considerations
of practical needs and ideological principles, representing its dual commitment
to both social and religio-nationalist values. As a movement self-perceived
as the sole moral and political alternative to the existing order, Hamas
has to maintain its radical image, identified with a strategy of violent
confrontation, which distinguished it from other Palestinian political
movements. Yet as a social movement Hamas must have taken into consideration
existential issues of "here and now". As such, Hamas could not but develop
political maneuverability despite its radical Islamic and national vision
and its claim to materialize this vision through violent means. 
<P>Hamas was able to bridge the gap between its ideological commitments
and pragmatic consideration as long as it managed to justify pragmatic
moves by normative terms, and to be engaged in pragmatic initiatives that
carry tolerable organizational risks. Hamas' institutional and structural
characteristics, however, indicate that the movement suffers from intrinsic
limitations in ensuring a viable basis of support for strategies of political
adjustment. If Hamas succeeded in adopting pragmatic modes of action without
being exposed to blames of deviation from core Islamic and Palestinian
nationalist norms, it was a result of external constellation and prevailing
conditions in the surrounding political environment, rather than of its
own institutional capabilities.

<P><A NAME="structure"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Nature of Intra-Organizational
Structure</B></FONT>
<BR>Similarly to other social movements and political organizations, much
of Hamas inter- and intra-organizational nature of activities is based
on hierarchical structure and inter-personal relations. Yet, what stands
out in the case of Hamas is the tension that prevails between the movement's
formal and informal elements. That is, between the religio-national ideology
and the communal needs, as well as the tension emanating from the power
struggle between outside and inside Hamas' leaders and institutions.

<P>The foundation of Hamas as an Islamic and Palestinian nationalist movement
at the beginning of the <I>Intifada</I>, was accompanied by in institutionalization
and territorialization processes. Hamas' quest for the establishment of
an Islamic state on the entire Mandatory Palestine as an alternative to
the PLO's two-states solution, and the adoption of a military strategy
against Israel, obliged the movement to develop formally-based institutional
capabilities in both the civilian and military spheres.

<P>The record of Hamas' civil and violent activities during the <I>Intifada</I>
indicated a growing awareness of the need to underpin those activities
on principles of formal organizational structure Hamas' growing activity
within the populace in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, amidst competition
with the United National Command (UNC) and confrontation with Israel, obliged
it to undergo an organizational effort to reduce internal complexity, avoid
conflicting commands and concentrate control in long these lines, Hamas
endeavored to create organizational infrastructure based on horizontally
and vertically tasks. Vertically, linkage of positions is based on hierarchical
chain of commands, instructions that go down and compliance reports that
go up, and control through supervisors with limited number of subordinated
while every subordinate has one clearly identified supervisor to whom he
is responsible. Horizontally, various tasks supposed to be grouped according
to functions performed for the organization.<A HREF="#e1">1</A> 
<P>The organizational infrastructure built by Hamas was meant to operate
in accordance with the principles of bureaucratic hierarchy. This infrastructure
included the security, military, civil activity, and Islamic preaching
(<I>da'wa</I>) apparatuses. These four apparatuses operated at as separate
regional headquarters for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In addition
to this functional division there was also a vertical division according
to geographic units with a leading figure responsible for every unit. The
Gaza Strip was divided into seven districts of activity. The West Bank
was divided into five districts: Jenin, Nablus, Tul Karm, Ramallah and
Hebron. Every district was divided into sub-districts which were further
divided into villages or refugee camps. At the regional level there were
also committees on education, publications, finance and prisoners.<A HREF="#e2">2</A>

<P>During the <I>Intifada</I> Hamas' hierarchical structure faced difficulties
due to Israel's repressive measures of detainment and deportation. Israel's
activity was directed especially against senior figures of Hamas which
weakened the higher and middle level of leadership in the occupied territories.
Under these circumstances two main organizational trends developed:
<UL>
<LI>
Hamas' political leadership moved to neighboring Arab states (mainly Jordan),
emulating other Palestinian activist groups in terms of between "outside"
headquarters and the "inside" basis of activity.</LI>

<LI>
Grass-root leaders, representing young, militant, and charismatic activists,
attained growing authority and freedom of action within their local constituencies.</LI>
</UL>
This trend toward decentralization was often reflected by local initiatives
which had exceeded--and sometimes contradicted--the policy and instructions
of the overall political leadership. This was particularly evident in the
case of execution of people suspected as collaborators with Israel or being
religiously immoral. The growing stature of the local leadership underlined
the organic elements in Hamas' structure. Along this line:
<UL>
<LI>
Tasks defined more "through the interaction of [local] members than ...
by the organization's top leaders.</LI>

<LI>
Decisions were driven more by "interaction among peers than strictly by
hierarchical authority and control."</LI>

<LI>
Commitment of local activists is more "to performing tasks and fulfilling
responsibilities effectively [...] rather than to blind loyalty and obedience
to superiors."<A HREF="#e3">3</A></LI><BR>&nbsp;</UL>
The organic nature of local activities led sometimes to dramatic results,
reflecting disproportion between the low hierarchical status of the activists
and the outcome of their non-authorized initiatives. What prevented a grave
organizational disharmony between the outside and inside leaders from deteriorating
into a total breakdown was its operational rather than ideological nature.
As long as the <I>Intifada</I> continued and the expulsion of Israel from
the occupied territories toped Hamas agenda, the differences and disputes
between various levels of authority within the movement remained a matter
of tactics rather than of principle.

<P>Indeed, it was due to external political circumstances that during the
<I>Intifada</I> Hamas' dilemma of radical vis-a-vis pragmatic motivations
was not as critical as in the post-Oslo era. Thus, as long as Hamas was
not obliged to adopt policies that might have been interpreted as a major
deviation from the ideological position, there was little chance that the
operational differences

<P>would develop into a threat to the movement's organizational unity.

<P>The militancy of the grass-root activists, the vacuum within the senior
and middle ranks due to detainments and deportations, and the dependency
on external funds, all brought to a growing influence of Hamas' leaders
outside the territories on the movement's mainstay in Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. The outside leaders, most of whom deportees from the occupied
territories, sought to enhance their control over the movement. Moreover,
in comparison to the inside, the members of this leadership represented
a relatively young technocratic, militant and educated group with the vision
of political Islamism, that is, a revolution from above, rather than with
communal action. Since their militancy coincided with that of the rank
and file's in the occupied territories, they helped the latter to reorganize
the movement's activity following the massive arrests of 1989 in a hierarchical
structure This initiative was designed to accord the "outside" leadership
control over the "inside" and secure subordination of the latter's operational
ranks.
<P><A NAME="future"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Oslo and the Future of Hamas-PNA
Relations</B></FONT>
<BR>The establishment of the PNA in Gaza and Jericho in May 1994 threatened
Hamas popular position as a whole but was of particular jeopardy for the
"outside" leadership's domination over the movement in the PNA's controlled
areas. Indeed, the growing penetration of the PNA within the Palestinian
society in Gaza increased the tension between the "outside" leadership
and Hamas' local leadership over the strategy of action in response to
the newly established political order. The differences were particularly
salient regarding the issue of establishing an Islamic political party
and its participation in the elections to the PNA's Council.

<P>The PNA's growing political control and discernible differences of opinion
between the "inside" and "outside" leaderintensified the latter's effort
to secure its influence within the movement through escalation of the military
effort, driving a wedge between the military command and the "inside" political
leadership. Along time, however, Israel's and the PNA's massive pressure
on the movement and particularly on the military apparatuses weakened the
"outside" control--based on normative interpretation, and material and
organizational resources---over the local leadership. Under such circumstances
the tension between the "outside" and "inside" leaders could be detrimental
to the Hamas' organizational unity, risking the fragile coexistence between
its two centers. In turn, such developments can deteriorate Hamas' ability
to adopt politics of adjustment.

<P>That Hamas managed to avoid organizational split and structural chaos
was due to three main causes:
<UL>
<LI>
The PNA's policy which, as a matter of tactics, preferred a dialogue and
coexistence over confrontation with Hamas.</LI>

<LI>
Israel's withdrawn demand that the PNA dismantle Hamas as a whole and willingness
to content with the PNA's preventive activity against radical Islamic terrorism.</LI>

<LI>
The temporary nature of the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accords, leaving open
key issues such as the future of Jewish settlements beyond the "green line,"
Jerusalem, borders and the final status of the Palestinian territory to
be determined at the final settlement stage. The fact that Arafat repeated
his commitment to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as it's capital, helped bridging some of the gap between
Hamas and the PNA pertaining to political goals of the peace process.</LI>
</UL>
It's a Hamas' internal weakness, and Israel's approach to the peace process
and to the role of Hamas in this context that turned the politics of adjustment
to a preferable option to both centers of leadership within Hamas over
other alternatives. A strategy of total confrontation on the part of the
"outside" leadership, attempting to undermine the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo
process, would have claimed high cost. . In the short-run uncontrolled
violence against Israel and the PNA could achieve that goal. In the long-run
however, it would have triggered violent retaliations on the part of both
Israel and the PNA, further tightening of the closure by Israel of the
autonomy areas, and a growing public resentment against Hamas which could
effectively alienate its local, non-military leadership. Thus, a policy
of total confrontation on Hamas' "outside" part could lead to strengthening
the PNA position and the "inside" Hamas leaders.
<P>On the part of the "inside" leaders, collaboration with the PNA or participation
in its institutions to a point denoting PNA de-facto recognition of the
PNA, in disregard of the "outside" leadership would have perhaps accorded
the "inside" leaders satisfactory trade-offs. Yet it would have aroused
a wide ressitance among the rank and file members, undermining the legitimacy
of the inside leadership. Arguably, than despite the "outside" leadership
control over resources and the military apparatus, as long as the vague
nature of the permanent Israeli Palestinian settlement; and the PNA's tolerant
policy toward Hamas sustain, it is probable that the movement will continue
to adhere to the politics of adjustment as a guiding political strategy.

<P>True, compared to other Islamic movements in the Arab countries Hamas
has operated in a political arena characterized by limited self-governing
authority and overall Israeli domination. This has resulted in an armed
struggle for national liberation against Israel and a political struggle
against the PNA, at the same time. One may argue that major changes in
the given reality might question the feasibility and benefit of continued
politics of adjustment by Hamas and its preference over other tactics.
A rapid progress in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations toward the permanent
settlement with clear-cut territorial, institutional, and economic gains
for the Palestinian side would increase the PNA's chances to receive wider
support from the Palestinian communities in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.

<P>In such scenario, Hamas' ability to enlist normative justification for
continued coexistence with the PNA, as well as its capabilities of public
action among the populace are expected to decrease, intensifying the differences
both internally and with the PNA. Such development might lead to either
or both possibilities of confrontation between Hamas and the PNA or split
within Hamas, within the autonomy areas as well s between "inside" and
"outside" leadership. On the other hand, stagnation or retreat of the Israeli-Palestinian
diplomatic process would aggravate public frustration of the Palestinian
public opinion, obliging the PNA to close ranks with Hamas and other radical
opposition movements.
<P>Still, given the complex Palestinian political arena, this study indicates
that even under conditions of rapid progress toward a permanent settlement,
Hamas would be most prudent not to reach the point of confrontation with
the PNA. Hamas is reform more than revolutionary; more populist than avant-guard
movement; more political than military; more communal than universalist.
Hamas is aware of cost benefit considerations and has been markedly calculated
in its decisions. Similarly, the PNA has demonstrated pragmatism over extremism
and prose of reality over poetry of ideology. Hamas has been cognizant
of its limitations, though without admitting it; anxious to preserve Palestinian
national unity--hence its extreme sensitivity to public opinion-particularly
in view of the PNA's volatile diplomatic process with Israel. Thus, one
might assume that even under conditions of crisis in the PNA-Hamas relations,
both sides would remain faithful to their insistence to prevent a total
showdown. Admittedly, this insistence tends to increase under growing sentiments
of hostility to Israel or a sense of threat on its part.

<P>Various structural and cultural causes might reinforce Hamas-PNA coexistence.
Unlike Arab revolutionary regimes such as of Syria, Iraq, and Algeria,
the PNA assumes a traditional image with tolerance to Islamist elements.
Unlike Syria or Iraq where the reigns of power are held by a religious
minority group the Palestinian society as a whole is decisively Sunni.
Above all, contrary to Syria and Iraq's policy of exclusion toward the
Islamic opposition, the PNA's policy toward opposition movements has been
markedly characterized by a policy of inclusion.

<P>By and large this policy aims at coopting the opposition to minimize
its effects on the decision-making process. The PNA's policy toward the
Islamic opposition resembles the patterns of negotiated coexistence adopted
by Jordan, or Saudi Arabia, toward the Islamic opposition. Under these
circumstances a deterioration of the PNA-Hamas relations would be probably
approached by the two parties more in terms of redefinition of their power
relations rather than embarking on extreme strategic decision toward each
other.<P><B>Notes</B>
