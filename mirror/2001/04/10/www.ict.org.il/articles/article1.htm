<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just a Matter of Time</FONT>
<BR>With the string of chemical-weapon terrorist attacks on various targets
in Japan in early 1995, a theoretical scenario has become real. Years of
discussions, debates, and contrasting assessments on the possibility of
terrorist organizations’ use of non-conventional weapons for mass murder
ended the moment the toxic gas Sarin began wafting through the tunnels
of Tokyo’s subway system.

<P>Many scholars who have studied terrorism agree today that it is only
a matter of time, now that the Supreme Truth cult in Japan has paved way
for others of its ilk, until other such groups use non-conventional weapons
on their attacks. Modern history abounds with examples of terrorist organizations
on one side of the globe that mimic a modus operandi and weapons that have
proven themselves on the other side of the globe.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nuclear Terrorism</FONT>
<BR>A nuclear terrorist attack is an incident in which a terrorist organization
uses a nuclear device to cause mass murder and devastation. Nuclear terrorism
also includes the use or threat of use, of fissionable radioactive materials
in an attack, an assault on a nuclear power plant for the purpose of causing
extensive and/or irreversible environmental damage. In this last case,
the terrorist organization need not develop, acquire or gain control of
a nuclear bomb in order to cause extensive damage. It need only use conventional
weapons against one of the many nuclear reactors in the world, seriously
damage the reactor, and thereby release radioactive matter into the atmosphere
in such a way as to endanger large population centers.

<P>Nuclear weapons can give terrorist organizations considerable advantages,
principally because they can inflict large numbers of casualties and command
worldwide media attention. Moreover, because it is hard to judge a terrorist
organization’s threats to use nuclear weapons, Western countries may soon
find themselves susceptible to terrorist blackmail under threat of a nuclear
strike and find themselves ensnared without knowing how likely the terrorists
are to carry out their threat.

<P>A terrorist organization may attempt to obtain fissionable material
or a nuclear bomb in a number of ways. It may purchase fissionable material
on the black market that has developed in Eastern Europe and elsewhere
following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the economic crisis that
has gripped most of the FSU, the demoralization of the Russian army, and
the deterioration of governmental control of radioactive material and nuclear
bombs in some of these countries Black-market commerce in radioactive material
has become a very real menace. There are daily disclosures of attempts
to smuggle equipment and fissionable materials for building atomic bombs
from various countries Among others , those involved in these attempts
include terrorist organizations, Third World countries, economic players,
and local mafias. According to the German weekly Der Spiegel, German intelligence
reports that the black market has been flooded with radioactive substances
such as enriched uranium and that 124 transactions in such materials have
been discovered around the world.

<P>Western intelligence concurs that the traffic in radioactive substances
has created a real danger of atomic weapons reaching irresponsible hands
that may use them for blackmail and attacks. CIA Director William Studeman,
in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on the subject of international
terrorism in April 1995, noted that the most serious threat of nuclear
terrorism is the use of materials or components that are currently stockpiled
in the republics of the former Soviet Union.

<P>A terrorist organization may purchase or obtain a nuclear bomb from
any country, particularly a country that supports terrorism. Many "revolutionary"
states in the Third World such as Iran, Iraq, and Libya are known to be
actively and regularly assisting various terrorist organizations. These
same states have reserved considerable resources and made massive investments
in the acquisition of nuclear capability, and are striving to develop or
purchase an atomic bomb, making it only a matter of time until these countries
attain their goal. The intimate relations of some of these countries with
terrorist organizations make it possible (although perhaps unlikely) that
one of these countries will provide atomic weapons to one of the organizations
that it patronizes in order to further its international interests by means
of this organization.

<P>A terrorist organization may construct a nuclear device by using scientists
who belong to it or by acquiring know-how and hiring scientists on the
black market. It is rather unlikely that a terrorist organization would
itself construct a nuclear bomb, for this requires special resources and
training that terrorist organization do not possess at the present time.
However it is worth bearing in mind that many unemployed nuclear scientists
are available on the world market, having been discharged in the FSU, and
are willing to sell their professional expertise and experience to the
highest bidder. With proliferation of nuclear reactors worldwide and, consequently,
the proliferation of nuclear experts, it is theoretically possible for
a terrorist organization to purchase the service of nuclear experts and,
with the assistance of a friendly country (that would give it the resources
and facilities it needs), develop a nuclear bomb.

<P>Terrorists may even seize a nuclear stockpile, one of the many stockpiles
of various nuclear devices and other hazardous substances around the world.
The European powers alone possessed about 50,000 nuclear bombs and warheads
in the mid-1980s. This vast nuclear arsenal is an attractive target for
terrorist organizations in many countries and requires massive outlays
to protect each and every nuclear bomb and site. The fear of capture of
a nuclear bomb by a terrorist organization is not unrealistic. Maps and
drawings of American nuclear storage facilities in West Germany were found
in the possession of Red Army faction activists who had been arrested in
West Germany in the early 1980s. When interrogated, the detainees admitted
that they had been gathering information on the facilities for the purpose
of attacking them and appropriating their nuclear weapons.

<P>According to a report by Russian intelligence in early 1993, there have
been about 150 incidents over the years in which terrorist organizations
have attempted to steal fissionable material, attack and damage nuclear
research facilities, and murder or kidnap officials or scientists dealing
with atomic research and development.

<P>The world community and, especially the great powers are aware of the
danger of acquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorists. To avert the menace,
several bilateral and international cooperative efforts have been made
Thus, the inaugural conference of the Nuclear Control Institute (set up
in the United States in the mid-1980s and staffed by nuclear experts and
scientist from various countries) resolved that the possibility of nuclear
terrorism must be recognized. In 1986, American and soviet representatives
discussed the possibility of theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists and
reached the conclusion that "danger detection centers" should be set up
that would facilitate rapid response if and when the problem arose. In
1993, the defense ministers of the NATO countries discussed the issue of
nuclear terrorism and decided to set up a committee of experts to look
into it.

<P>Thus, terrorist organizations have various options for obtaining nuclear
capability or a nuclear device. It is important to remember that terrorist
organizations usually lack moral scruples and do not fear a nuclear response
or damage to their international interests as a result of using nuclear
weapons (a fear that has deterred sovereign states from using weapons of
this kind in war and peacetime). All these factors make terrorist organizations
more dangerous in nuclear terms than sovereign states.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chemical Terrorism</FONT>
<BR>In contrast to nuclear terrorism, which remains a problematic and complex
matter to carry out and is therefore still largely theoretical, chemical
terrorism is more concrete and practical, and in several instances has
already been used. The most conspicuous chemical terrorist attack occurred
in early 1995, when members of the Supreme Truth cult in Japan released
toxic gases in various targets, particularly the subway systems of Tokyo
and Yokohama, injuring dozens and killing several. Fortunately the number
of victims did not reach higher proportions despite the high toxicity of
the material released and the panic that gripped the subway passengers
and caused a stampede from the sites involved. This was the first time
an extremist organization had attempted to use a chemical substance in
a mass terrorist attack. It was not, however the first use of chemical
agents by terrorist organizations in order to instill terror, carry out
blackmail, or cause large scale economic damage to their rivals. In several
cases, various organizations in different parts of the world have laced
food products on order to sabotage marketing if them and terrorize consumers.
This was the case with citrus fruit exported from Israel to European markets
in which a chemical substance was injected in order to cause economic damage
to Israel. In another case, a toxin was injected into a chocolate confection
in Japan in order to blackmail the manufacturers. In 1991, a toxin was
found in jars of baby food in Israel.

<P>Accordingly, chemical terrorism may be divided into two main types:
1) Attacks meant to cause mass devastation. In these cases, the terrorist
organization releases a toxin in congested population centers, bodies of
water, and unventilated areas in order to harm as many victims as possible.
2) Chemical attacks meant primarily to terrorize, blackmail, or cause economic
damage - a specific attack on a particular product (particularly a food
product, mainly by introducing a toxic chemical substance into the product
itself).

<P>For the organizations involved, chemical terrorism has several clear-cut
advantages over conventional or nuclear terrorism. First of all, chemical
substances are more accessible and available. They can be manufactured
using simple chemical processes known to any university student. The components
are usually simple products that can be obtained in the free market without
restrictions. A chemical attack can be perpetrated using off-the-shelf
pesticides sold in grocery stores. If this were not enough, many countries
(including Third World countries and known supporters of terrorist organizations)
have large arsenals of chemical materials. Therefore, one must reckon with
the possibility of transfer of chemical weapons (unlike nuclear weapons)
from one of these countries- particularly those that have not flinched
from using chemical weapons against their own citizens and in their wars
with neighboring countries- to a terrorist organization in order to perpetrate
attacks.

<P>Chemical terrorism is inexpensive and does not require extensive facilities.
Because toxic chemical substances are ordinarily quite expensive to purchase
or manufacture (at least when compared with nuclear substances), resource
-starved organizations can obtain and use them very easily.

<P>Chemical substances have the advantage of mobility. In contrast to a
nuclear bomb, which is usually large and cumbersome and requires special
vehicles and security in transport, small amounts of chemicals suffice
for a chemical attack. For example a jar containing several hundred grams
of a chemical substance may cause mass mortality and, of course, can be
moved about easily, with no need for special preparations or security.

<P>Over the years, modern technology has made great progress in the detection
of conventional weapons and explosives. Many countries have put this technology
to practical use at sensitive facilities and in congested population centers.
The technology for the detection of chemical substances, in contrast, has
not been disseminated as widely and has not been used for preventative
security in the foiling of terrorist attacks. This facilitates the terrorist’s
work in delivering chemical substances to their targets and concealing
them there with very little chance of prior detection.

<P>A massive chemical terrorist attack has a very wide field of impact.
The dispersion of a chemical substance in a congested area may cause many
casualties. However, beyond the grave physical damage caused by exposure
to the chemical substance, an attack of this kind may cause many additional
casualties because of citizen’s panic and attempts to flee the disaster
site.

<P>Moreover, a chemical terrorist attack, for the very reason that it involves
a non-conventional weapon, will inevitably trigger a serious crisis of
morale and undermine the personal security of the citizens of the country
attacked. In this context, it should be borne in mind that most chemical
weapons are colorless, odorless, and devoid of any other identifying factor.
Therefore, they cannot be detected until the moment citizens are exposed
and experience symptoms. Furthermore, it is difficult to protect oneself
from chemical substances and prepare for their eventuality. This aggravates
the morale problem. CIA Director Studeman further warned that terrorist
organizations throughout the world would adopt chemical weapons such as
those used in the Tokyo subway attack.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Biological Terrorism</FONT>

<P>Biological terrorism is the "use and dissemination of biological weapons
(various kinds of microbes) in population centers, by various means, in
order to cause morbidity and numerous causalities."

<P>Unlike the tools of chemical terrorism, biological weapons were not
designed to be used (and ordinarily cannot be used) for pinpoint attacks;
their principle purpose is mass devastation. The results of a biological
attack are not immediate: they become apparent several hours or days later
(and after some of the victims have left the site of the attack). This
may make it harder to detect the perpetrator and target of the attack.

<P>Biological weapons are not as common, accessible, and available as chemical
weapons. For a terrorist organization, the two main sources of biological
weapons are home manufacture and acquisition or purchase from sovereign
states.

<P>Homemade biological weapons require the use of sophisticated biological
laboratories and resources of diverse kinds, which, on the whole, are not
available to terrorist organizations. However various countries (particularly
those that are unable to obtain nuclear weapons) have stockpiles of biological
and chemical weapons. Under certain circumstances, some of them may deliver
biological weapons to terrorist groups that enjoy their patronage for the
purpose of attacks.

<P>Once a terrorist organization has succeeded in obtaining biological
weapons, it can move them from place to place very easily (as it can with
chemical weapons) and without fear of detection. Similarly, the weapon
can be transported to the vicinity of the target and, if necessary, concealed
there until used.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How to Respond</FONT>
<BR>According to Western intelligence, international terrorist organizations
are aware of the considerable advantages of non-conventional weapons, and
some of them are making strenuous efforts to obtain chemical and biological
devices. As far back as early 1989, US Secretary of State George Shultz
spoke on this matter in Paris, at the opening of the international conference
on the banning of chemical weapons. The terrorist organizations, he said,
are unlikely to resist the temptation to use chemical weapons without prior
warning in order to attract political and media attention in a dramatic
way.

<P>Some terrorist organizations seem to have already prepared for the possibility
of using non-conventional methods. According to British and American media,
Palestinian and Iraqi terrorists were trained in the early 1980s at a special
facility of the East German secret police (Stasi) near Berlin in poisoning
water sources (rivers, wells, and surface reservoirs) and in using biological
weapons and toxic gases. According to one of the German instructors who
worked at the facility, the terrorists were trained in the dispersion of
microbes in congested locations such as airports and railway stations.
According to the media sources who exposed the affair, the training facility
for the poisoning of water sources was relocated from Germany to Iraq in
the mid-1980s, and German instructors continued to work there.

<P>The West must gird itself for the possibility of the onset of a new
phase on the actions of the world terrorist network: the non-conventional
phase, characterized by the use of non-conventional weapons for mass killing
and devastation, or the threat of using these weapons for blackmail or
the attainment of other political goals. The world community must recognize
the gravity of the threat and take measures today to contend with it. Appropriate
measures would include tougher control and inspection of non-conventional
weapons, a ban on the unrestricted sale of raw materials for chemical weapons,
and an airtight international boycott of all countries found to be responsible
for delivering non-conventional weapons to terrorist organizations. In
addition, technology should be developed to trace non-conventional substances,
neutralize them and provide suitable and swift antidotes for the victims.

<P>The Western nations must recognize the menace at the door and begin
cooperating more effectively in the war against terrorism in general, and
in the inevitable confrontation with non-conventional terrorism, in particular.
