<p>The shooting on 11 August of small children and their teachers at the North Valley
Jewish Community Center, Granada Hills, California is only the latest in
a spate of racist and anti-Semitic terrorist attacks by right-wing radicals—not
only in the United States, but also in Russia and in Europe.</td>

<p>It is now clear that Buford Furrow, the man who shot and injured three
children and two adults at the community center and killed a Filipino-American
postal worker, was connected with neo-Nazi and extremist right-wing organizations
and groups in the U.S.
<p>Furrow’s automatic-rifle attack was well-planned; his van contained
thousands of rounds of ammunition that could have been used in later assaults,
some flak vests, body armor and survivalist literature, a Washington state
map. Tracts titled <i>War Cycles, Peace Cycles</i> and <i>Ranger Handbook</i>
were also found in the van.
<p>According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Buford Furrow, 37, reportedly
lived with (or according to other sources was married to), Debbie Mathews,
the widow of Robert J. Mathews. Mathews had been head of “The Order” (
<a href="http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/an_phineas.html" target="_blank">www.adl.org/backgrounders/an_phineas.html</a>),
the most violent and notorious American domestic terrorist group of the
1980s. Furrow allegedly met Debbie Mathews at the headquarters of Aryan
Nations, a neo-Nazi and Christian Identity group based in Hayden Lake,
Idaho. Robert Mathews, died in 1984 in a shoot-out and fire while trying
to hold off federal agents who had surrounded his hideout on Whidbey Island,
Washington.
<p>According to former neo-Nazi skinhead Tom Leyden, now a consultant for
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, in the mid-1990s Furrow was
a skinhead giving hand-to-hand combat training at a Hitler Youth Camp in
Hayden Lake. Leyden was quoted by CNN, said that Furrow’s philosophy was
“hardcore Christian Identity.” His worldview included the belief that “the
Jews are evil, that the whites are good and the good have to go kill the
evil.”
<p>Despite reports of possible links to hate groups, Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard Parks said the suspect Furrow appeared to be working alone
in the Jewish center incident.

<p><b>The United States and Russia lead in right-wing terrorist attacks</b>
<p>A not exhaustive list of shooting and bombing attacks in the last few
months illustrates the sharp rise in Right Wing extremist attacks
<p><b>4 April 1999: </b>A powerful blast outside a downtown Moscow office
of Russia’s Federal Security Service injured three people and shattered
dozens of windows.
<p>According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), officials with the
Federal Security Service believe that the bombing may have been the work
of the same obscure group that claimed responsibility for a failed grenade-launcher
attack on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in late April. That attack was reportedly
carried out to protest the U.S.-led NATO military operation in Yugoslavia.
<p>The group that claimed responsibility for the failed embassy attack
recently urged those U.S. citizens who opposed the NATO air strikes to
leave Moscow. The group, called Skif—which means Scythian, an ancient warlike
people—said it would continue “acts of retribution” against those Americans
remaining in Moscow after its deadline.
<p>According to other sources the bombing may have been the work of the
same people who bombed a Moscow synagogue on May 13, 1999, because the
bomb was identical to the device used in the bombing of the Marina Roscha
Synagogue (see below). Security service officials also said that both had
been planted in a similar manner. The officials gave no explanation why
those responsible for the synagogue attack would want to bomb the Federal
Security Service office.
<p><b>17 April 1999:</b> A homemade bomb injured nearly 40 people in Brixton,
a
<p>mostly black neighborhood of London, Great Britain.
<p>On <b>April 24</b> another bomb detonated in the trunk of a car in Brick
Lane, a primarily Bangladeshi neighborhood in London's East End. Six people
were injured, none seriously. This was the second race-related attack within
a week. The two bombs were apparently of the same type - nails, shrapnel
and a simple timer.
<p>On <b>April 30</b>, an explosion at the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho,
London left three people dead. Two of the dead were a pregnant woman and
the best man at her wedding. Sixty-five people were injured; many lost
limbs or were severely mutilated by flying glass and nails.
<p>In both cases a neo-Nazi group called Combat 18 claimed responsibility
for the blasts. As was the case with the Brixton bombing, the target in
the Brick Lane attack appears to have been chosen for symbolic value. The
racially mixed Brick Lane community was the focus of a two-decade battle
by residents and anti-racism activists to shut down the local office of
the right-wing National Front.
<p>British police have arrested and charged a 22 year-old engineer with
carrying out the series of bombings in London. David Copeland of Cove,
Copeland was charged with perpetrating all three of the bombings. Inside
Copeland's home police discovered explosives, wiring, batteries, clocks,
sports bags and several pounds of nails.
<p>He was apparently working on his own and police say that they are not
looking for any one else in connection with the attacks. Assistant commissioner
of the Metropolitan police, David Veness, said at a press conference that
Copeland doesn't appear to have any connection to neo-Nazi groups.
<p><b>13 May 1999</b>: The Marina Roscha synagogue in Moscow, Russia, was
bombed just minutes after some 70 children and their teachers had left
the three-story synagogue building after celebrating the Jewish holiday
of Lag B’Omer. Two workers at a nearby construction site at a Jewish community
center were lightly injured by the blast. The bomb, equivalent to more
than a pound of TNT, partially destroyed two floors of the building
<p>The same night the Marina Roscha synagogue was attacked, a burning container
was thrown at the Darchei Shalom synagogue, the newest of Moscow’s four
synagogues. The container caused a small fire near the building’s outer
wall. Three days later, the rabbi’s car was burned outside Darchei Shalom.
<p>A neo-Nazi group, Russian National Unity, allegedly claimed responsibility
for the attack on the Marina Roscha synagogue. But the group’s leader,
Alexander Barkashov, denied that it was involved. Several nationalist leaders,
however, said the attack could have been a reaction to the prominence of
Jews in the Yeltsin government.
<p><b>18 May, 1999</b>: An explosive charge was discovered inside a bag
at the entrance to the “Shalom” theater in Moscow. One of the theater employees
said she found a bag on May 10. Hoping that someone would come to pick
it up, she took the bag out of the building and left it outside without
checking its contents. Days later, a passer-by took the bag and left its
contents—a cylinder-shaped explosive device—at the theater’s entrance.
The police defused the device.
<p><b>May 1999</b>: The synagogue belonging to the Birobidzhan Jewish community,
in the autonomous province of Russia, was damaged twice this month. A bomb
was discovered at the synagogue less than three weeks after two bombs went
off near Moscow’s two largest synagogues. Police said there could be a
link between the three events.
<p><b>May 1999</b>: In Britain, shots were fired at the Maccabi building
in London. The background of the attack is unclear.
<p><b>18 June 1999</b>: Arsonists attacked three synagogues in Sacramento,
California. The attacks occurred almost simultaneously, indicating that
they were coordinated. Anti-Jewish and anti-NATO leaflets found on the
premises read, inter alia: “The ugly American and NATO aggressors are the
ultimate hypocrites. The fake Albanian refugee crises was manufactured
by the Jewish media to justify the terrorizing, the bestial bombing of
our Yugoslavia back into the dark ages,” and “We are Slavs, we will never
allow the international Jewish World Order to take our Land.” The police
suspect that The National Alliance and the World Church of the Creator
were behind the attacks (http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/sacramento_arsons.html#wcotc).
These two white supremacist organizations habeen expanding and have become
increasingly active in the United States.
<p><b>28 June 1999</b>: A car-bomb targeted antifascist activist and his
eight-year-old son in the Stockholm suburb of Nacka, Sweden. The explosion
seriously injured both passengers. This act was the culmination of a series
of nazi harassment directed against antifascist activists in the Stockholm
area.
<p><b>2 July 1999</b>: Minorities were targeted in three separate shooting
attacks in Chicago, Illinois within a 20-kilometer radius. A black man
was killed and six Orthodox Jews were wounded. The assailant later fired
on an Asian-American couple as they sat in their vehicle, but no one was
injured. Casings found at the scene of the shootings indicate that the
attacker carried two weapon—a .22 rifle and a .380 semi-automatic. He appears
to have switched weapons between shootings.
<p>All of the attacks were perpetrated by the same person—a 21-year-old
white male named Benjamin Smith—and were apparently racially motivated.
In Smith’s apartment were found two gun boxes, a receipt for ammunition
and several bundles of anti-Semitic literature. However, the local police
said they believe he acted alone. Smith, an avowed white supremacist, shot
and killed himself after a brief police chase.
<p><b>13 July 1999</b>: A prominent community leader of the Jewish community
in Moscow, Leopold Kaimovsly, was stabbed and seriously wounded at the
Choral Synagogue in Moscow. The perpetrator, a 20-year-old student named
Nikita Krivchun, shouted during his arrest, “There are 50,000 of us, we
will kill you anyway.” He later said he wanted to combat what he called
the “evil” of Judaism, but denied membership in a neo-Nazi group and insisted
that he had no accomplices.
<p>However, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency an unidentified
individual phoned the Choral Synagogue to say that a Russian neo-Nazi leader
had ordered his organization to set up “actions” near several Moscow synagogues.
<p><b>July 25, 1999</b>: A young boy discovered a bomb inside the Bolshaya
Bronnaya synagogue in Moscow. The bomb was discovered when the synagogue
was crowded with children.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Recent History of Right-Wing Terrorism</b>
<p>Right-wing radicals used terrorism as a political tool in the 1970s
and the beginning of the 1980s. The main theater of operations was Italy,
where the Terza Posizione (Third Position) organization was responsible
for probably the deadliest right-wing terrorist attack of the period—the
bombing of the Bologna railway station on 2 August 1980. The attack left
more than 80 people dead and hundreds injured. At the same time several
less lethal right-wing terrorist groups were active in Germany.
<p>Since the eradication of the Italian and German right-wing terrorists
at the beginning of the 1980s no serious terrorist activity was waged by
these elements until autumn 1992. Then German right-wing neo-Nazis and
skinheads began to attack Turkish immigrants, Gypsies and foreign workers
on German soil, often using arson to lethal effect. This violent xenophobic
activity proliferated in other Western and Eastern European countries,
reaching a new peak in 1994 in Austria, where right-wing elements used
letter-bombs and car-bombs to attack the same targets. Right-wing terrorism
increased at the beginning of the 1990s on the background of the crumbling
Communist block, the re-unification of Germany and the chronic unemployment
in most European countries.
<p>Yet, the deadliest terrorist event of this period—the bombing of the
Federal Murrah building—occurred not in Europe but in Oklahoma City, in
the USA on April 19, 1995. The explosion killed 168 people. The convicted
bomber, Timothy McVeigh, claimed that the attack was in revenge for the
people the federal government killed in a raid on the Davidian cult’s compound
near Waco, Texas in 1993.
<p>In practically all the cases—even in the Bologna bombing—only individuals
were convicted in court and no organization or group was found responsible
for these acts of terror.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The New Strategy of the “Leaderless Resistance<i>”</i></b>
<p>It should be noted that in February 1992, Louis Beam, a known American
white-supremacist published a pamphlet titled “Leaderless Resistance” inhis<b>
</b>review<b> </b><i>The Seditionist</i>. The pamphlet proposed a new strategy
to be followed by what he called “the brave sons and daughters [willing]
to fight off ever increasing persecution, oppression…and tyranny” of the
U.S. federal government.
<p>In his document Beam argues that the American government shows a willingness
to use ever more severe police state measures against dissidents. This
changing situation makes it clear that those who oppose “state repression”
must be prepared to adapt their behavior, strategy, and tactics to the
new situation. Methods must be objectively measured as to their effectiveness,
as well as to whether they help or hinder the government’s intention of
repression.
<p>According to Beam, in the pyramid type of modern organizations, an infiltrator
can destroy anything that is beneath his level of infiltration and often
those above him as well. If the traitor has infiltrated at the top, then
the entire organization from the top down is compromised and may be subverted
at will.
<p>Thus an alternative to the pyramid type of organization is the cell
system. This is not the cell system after the Communist model, dependent
upon central direction, which means impressive organization, funding from
the top and outside support. “American patriots have none of these things
at the top or anywhere else, and so an effective cell organization based
upon the Soviet system of operation is impossible.”
<p>Beam proposes therefore the “Phantom Cell” mode of organization, described
as Leaderless Resistance. A system of organization that is based on the
cell organization, but does not have any central control or direction—a
system that is, in fact, “almost identical to the methods used by the Committees
of Correspondence during the American Revolution.”
<p>Utilizing the Leaderless Resistance concept, all individuals and groups
operate independently of each other, and never report to a central headquarters
or single leader for direction or instruction, as would those who belong
to a typical pyramid organization.
<p>The participants in a program of Leaderless Resistance, through phantom
cells or individual action, must know exactly what they are doing, and
how to do it. It becomes the responsibility of the individual to acquire
the necessary skills and information as to what is to be done. This is
by no means as impractical as it appears, because it is certainly true
that in any movement, all persons involved have the same general outlook,
are acquainted with the same philosophy, and generally react to given situations
in similar ways.
<p>Beam describes the operational communication in such a system:
<blockquote>“Organs of information distribution such as newspapers, leaflets,
computers, etc., which are widely available to all, keep each person informed
of events, allowing for a planned response that will take many variations.
No one need issue an order to anyone. Those idealists truly committed to
the cause of freedom will act when they feel the time is ripe, or will
take their cue from others who precede them.”</blockquote>
Therefore, Leaderless Resistance leads to very small cells, or even one-man
cells of resistance. Such a situation is an intelligence nightmare for
a government intent upon knowing everything they possibly can about those
who oppose them.
<p>From the material published by various right-wing groups and organizations,
we know that many of them accept and apply the strategy of Leaderless Resistance.
<p>According to <i>Klanwatch Intelligence Report</i> (June 1995), in the
aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing the many hard-core “Patriot” militia
groups divided into “cells” and went underground, in accordance with the
Leaderless Resistance strategy Beam proposed in February 1992. Handbooks
put out by Militia of Montana, the Florida State Militia and other lesser-known
groups vigorously advocate this structure.
<p>Many of the incidents and attacks presented in this article seem also
to comply with this strategy. However, in order for the leaderless strategy
to succeed tis a need of a common ideology, designation of shared targets
and the diffusion of “mots d’ordre” (signals). The neo-Nazi, militia or
“Patriot” groups skillfully make use of the modern means of communication
and diffusion. They were among the first to realize the enormous advantages
of the Internet as a tool for the dissemination of their ideological and
propaganda material, and also to keep secret and underground contacts.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Governments Have Trouble Coping with the New Strategy</b>
<p>The recent wave of terrorism indicates that the various groups and individuals
active in the wider right-wing sphere have learned the lessons of the past,
have adapted to the modern environment and feel sufficiently confident
to up-grade and intensify their violent aggression against the democratic
societies. They surface not only on the Internet but are ready to confront
the “enemy” in the heart of Washington or Moscow.
<p>In February of this year, 200 members of Russia’s largest ultra-nationalist
group marched in the capital with their Nazi-style armbands and stiff-armed
salutes on display. The police briefly detained some of the neo-Nazis but
then released them and allowed them to continue their march.
<p>In Washington, a planned rally near the White House organized by the
white-supremacist American Nationalist Party, which has called itself “the
fastest-growing right-wing party in existence,” fizzled out on August 7,
when only a handful of the white supremacists showed up. The last white-supremacist
gathering in Washington—by the Ku Klux Klanmarched from the Washington
Monument to the Capitol in October 1990.
<p>Another characteristic of this year’s terrorist activity is the large
number of anti-Semitic incidents, although the general background is racist
and xenophobic.
<p>There is a marked increase in anti-Jewish propaganda in various parts
of the world. This is worrying because it has been seen that heightened
propaganda is invariably followed by violent actions against Jews or their
facilities.
<p>Not only in the United States, but also in other countries, such as
Great Britain, the police and the juridical authorities treat the problem
of right-wing terrorism as acts of criminal violence and do not confront
the full political implications of the phenomena. In the United States,
this approach results mainly from the constitutional First Amendment, which
grants unrestricted freedom of speech and publication. The ease in the
acquisition of firearms also contributes to the ease with which right-wing
American militants can prepare themselves for the perpetration of acts
of terror.
<p>In Russia, right-wing violence and terrorism are facilitated by the
general ambience of disorder, growing criminality. Another contributing
factor are the anti-Semitic and xenophobic sentiments on the part of the
general public and part of the political class.
<p>The situation seems much better in the European countries, which in
the 1990s adopted severe restrictions and legislation against racist and
anti-Semitic offenses, with Germany and France leading in this field. The
legislation deals not only with hate crimes but also forbids hate publications
and propaganda, including Holocaust denial.
<p>On this background it is not surprising that the German authorities
in 1995 achieved the arrest and extradition from Denmark of the known American
neo-Nazi Gerhard (Gary) Lauck. This followed the refusal of the American
authorities to stop his activity from his base in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lauck
was accused by the Germans of being the main underground provider of Nazi
propaganda material for German right-wingers as well as inciting the terrorist
attacks in 1992-93 against foreign workers and Jews.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>Though it does not threaten the population at large, right-wing terrorism—enhanced
by the huge coverage of modern media—represents mainly a political and
psychological danger to the stability of democratic societies. If the United
States, Great Britain, Russia and other states do not wish to see the proliferation
of a new and more virulent kind of right-wing terrorism, their governments
must act swiftly and vigorously, not only against the individual perpetrators,
but against the ideological and propaganda infrastructure which breeds
the phenomena.
