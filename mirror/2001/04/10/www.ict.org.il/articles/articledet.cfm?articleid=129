<br><i>Successful anti-terrorist action or a drop in the bucket?</I></h2></center>

<p><p><b>Preface</b>
<br>On July 21<sup>st</sup> 2000, U.S. federal agents arrested 18 alleged
supporters of the Lebanese Hizballah. The arrested were suspected of being
part of a ring that raised and sent funds and military equipment to Hizballah
in Lebanon, through illegal means.
<p>At this point it remains unclear whether the ring was formed as a private
initiative of its members or at the behest of the Hizballah leaders. The
extent of the organizations’ actions in the U.S. is also still unknown.
However, it’s seems likely that either at their own initiative or by direct
request, some Islamist groups are exploiting “The Land of Unlimited Opportunity”
as a base for gathering support (moral, financial and military), despite
the traditional Shi’ite hatred<font face="David"><font size=-1> </font></font>of
the West and the U.S.
<p>The incident is an example of how terrorist organizations raise funds
through supporters abroad. In this case, it seems that an investigation
into the ring’s activitities would have been impossible had it used legal
fund-raising methods. This is despite the fact that the U.S. legislated
an anti-terrorism act in 1996 that forbade contributing money to any of
the organizations listed as involved in terrorism. In fact, the anti-terrorism
act has only been enforced once so far. The problem is the need to demonstrate
causal relationships, entailing as it does tracking down the sources and
final destination of the funds. The difficulties in finding direct evidence
must first be overcome in order to push through a penal indictment.<b><i></i></b>
<p><b><i>Modus operandi</i></b>
<br>The Hizballah made effective use of the constitutionally protected
freedom of occupation and assembly in the United States to gathered money
in semi-legal and illegal ways. Headed by 26 year-old Mohammad Youssef
Hammoud, some of its members evaded immigration laws through false marriages.
Initially, luck was on the ring members’ side, as some of them gained American
citizenship due to delays and mistakes on the part of immigration authorities.
<p>The ring bought cigarettes in North Carolina and smuggled them to Michigan,
selling them there to the local Arab community and gaining profits from
the tax differences. The money was “laundered” through investments in the
group’s assets, and, as FBI experts suspect, was afterwards transferred,
along with donations gathered by the group, to the Lebanese Hizballah.
No estimate is available of the groups’ profits or the amount transferred
to Lebanon. According to Canadian Intelligence (CSIS) sources, some of
the profits were used to purchase military equipment, including night-vision
goggles, and other electronic paraphernalia.
<p>There is also evidence that the group maintained active spiritual connections
between local Moslems, with whom they met regularly, and the Hizballah
organization via the Hizballah Internet site.
<p>There is no evidence of a plan to carry out terrorist activities, though
one investigative source cited the general willingness of the group leader’s
(a trained militant) to conduct such acts, should he be instructed to.
<p>The cigarette smuggling <i>modus operandi</i> should be regarded solely
as an example, as many others fund-raising methods could be used. Any sufficiently
sophisticated money laundering mechanism would make it far more difficult
to track down the sources and recipients of the money, and to lay hands
on those responsible for transferring the money to terrorist activity.
<p><b>The current legal status of the detainees</b>
<br>Most of the group’s members were released on bail, and two were placed
under a 24 hour house arrest. All except four pleaded innocent, with the
rest requesting a trial by jury. Those who confessed to the immigration
offenses have not addmitted any linkage to terrorism. The maximum punishment
of each of them is between 6 months and 40 years.
<p>None of the ring’s alleged members are accused of any terrorism-related
activities; all are solely accused of domestic penal offences, such as
smuggling, illegal immigration and money laundering. However, as the 3
year-old investigation continues it may be possible to find the legal basis
such an accusation in the near future.
<p>It should be noted that the U.S. forbids any financial aid to terrorist
organizations, not merely the funding of actual terrorist activities. The
offense of funding a terrorist organization carries a maximum of 10 years
punishment. Islamic-American leaders and human rights activists argue that
this should be declared unconstitutional, for it contradicts with the first
amendment’s right of association; one should be able to donate to any cause
one supports. Officials claim that the financial aid—even if earmarked
for an organization’s social activities—increases the terrorist organization’s
total budget, allowing it to dedicate more resources to military purposes.
Legally speaking, by making any financial aid to terrorist groups illegal,
the anti-terrorism bill reduces the state’s need to track down the exact
use of the money, making it far easier to establish the causal relation
necessary for a conviction. This law, too, can be evaded through money
transference to an organization that is not listed as a terrorist group.
<p><b>Responses to the arrests</b>
<br>Hizballah immediately issued a statement denying any connection to
the smuggling ring. Hizballah senior activist Naim Kassem denied having
any organized group outside of Lebanon. He claimed the U.S. could not arrest
people for their support of Hizballah. Yet, he stressed that though the
organization opposed U.S. foreign policy, it intends to maintain actions
on the declarative-political level, and therefore posses no threat to the
U.S. It should be mentioned that in the past the organization attacked
U.S. navy targets in Lebanon.
<p>Other Hizballah activists stated that Hizballah managed with donations
granted by the people of Lebanon and other Arab countries. According to
Abdallah Kasir, many immigrants donate money to the organization, but in
an unorganized manner. Hizballah’s name was connected to this episode,
according to these officials, due to the U.S. desire to cut back the Israeli
humiliation in withdrawing from Southern Lebanon, and reflected a continuation
of the American’s hostile policies towards the organization.
<p>Iran, which is infamous for supporting Hizballah financially and militarily,
claimed the U.S. published the reports regarding the arrests “in order
to please the Zionist regime.” The local Arab community in the U.S. was
furious with the way the arrests were presented to the public. They claimed
that the criminal involvement was presented as terrorism-oriented without
sufficient evidence, therefore re-enforcing a negative stereotype of Arabs
and Muslims in the public eye. According to activists in the Arab-American
community, the issue reflected prejudice against Lebanese Arabs on the
part of the authorities.
<p><b>A future prospective</b>
<br>Hizballah, “The Party of God,” is a Shi’ite Lebanese organization established
after the 1982 “Peace for Galilee” operation. It has carried out hundreds
of attacks, including terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish civilian
targets. Though Hizballah’s annual budget was estimated to be around 50-100
million US dollars, received mostly from Iran (both for its social-political
affairs as well as for its military needs), the organization does not waste
any opportunity to enlarge its resources. Hizballah is reported to collect
donations in South America through illegal means. If these allegations
are, in fact, correct, it points to a bold and dangerously pragmatic approach
on the part of the organization, in that it will make use of all possible
methods to raise funds. This policy continues even now, after Israel’s
unilateral withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, which decreased the legitimacy
of the organization’s military operations.
<p>It should be noted that other anti-Israeli and anti-Western Islamist
organizations are known to raise funds in the U.S., including the Hamas
and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In this specific case, chance and the
alertness of local policemeplayed a role in the prevention of more funds
being transferred. However, the case of the North Carolina cigarette ring
should serve as a wake-up call for other countries to enforce anti-terrorism
acts to prevent transferring money to terrorist organizations, whether
gathered by legal or illegal ways.
