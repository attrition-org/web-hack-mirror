<p><b><font size=+1>The Advent of Ariel Sharon:</font></b>
<br><b><i><font size=+1>A matter of war &amp; peace</font></i></b></center>

<p>The recent victory of Ariel Sharon in the recent Israeli election, with
the support of an overwhelming majority of the Israeli public is intimately
linked to the peace process, terrorism and the Palestinian return to the
path of violence after the failure of the Camp-David summit in October
2000.
<p>Since the signing of the Oslo accords in Washington in 1993, political
violence has been used as a bargaining chip by the Palestinians time after
time, in order to achieve additional political concessions from the Israeli
government. At first, during the term of the late Prime Minister Rabin,
from 1993 to 1996, the violence usually took the form of Hamas terrorist
activity. The motto of Israeli counter-terrorism strategy at the time was
“we shall pursue peace as if there were no terrorism.” Not only did terrorism
not threaten the fulfillment of the Palestinian national interests, but
some Israelis ministers even openly declared at the time that the terrorist
attacks in the Gaza Strip showed that Israel had no choice but to withdraw
unilaterally. The message was clear: terrorism and political activity work
together to bring about Israeli political concessions. This was one of
the reasons that Arafat did not use his military capabilities since the
establishment of the Palestinian Authority to crush the military wing and
infrastructure of Hamas. He wanted to preserve his capability to renew
violence against Israel.
<p>The two main concessions that former Prime Minister Netanyahu made during
the peace process—the withdrawal from Hebron, and the signing of the Wye
agreements—occurred only after the outbreak of two well-orchestrated “popular”
uprisings. The first of these was in September 1996, after Israel has opened
to tourism the Western Wall tunnels in Jerusalem. The second was in 1997,
after the Israeli government decided to establish a Jewish neighborhood
in Har Homa in Jerusalem. By making concession after—and only after—Palestinian
riots, Netanyahu sent a clear message to the Palestinians: Israeli concessions
can only be won through political violence.
<p>Prime Minister Barak went to Camp David with all the intention of signing
a final peace treaty with the Palestinians. He was ready to make political
concessions to the Palestinians that were unconceivable in the eyes of
the average Israeli citizen. Not only was he ready to establish a Palestinian
state on more than 93 percent of the West Bank and Gaza strip, he was ready
even to divide the Israeli capital, Jerusalem, into two capitals—one Israeli
and the other Palestinian. What’s more, Barak agreed to withdrawal from
the Jordan Valley, a step which all previous Israeli governments—both Likud
and Labor—had long regarded as endangering the very existence of Israel.
This is because, without the buffer zone of the Jordan Valley, the most
densely populated part of Israel is a strip only 14 miles wide. Had Arafat
agreed to Barak’s proposals, this narrow strip would have been squeezed
between the newborn Palestinian State and the Mediterranean Sea, and in
case of a war could easily be sealed off to split Israel in two. The only
way to prevent the invasion of the Arab armies into the Palestinian State
in case of war would be for Israel to retain military control of the Jordan
Valley, an area with very few Palestinian inhabitants.
<p>But this was not the most impossible of Barak’s proposed concessions.
He also offered to grant 100,000 Palestinians “the right of return.” These
refugees would live in Israel, rather than in the new Palestinian State,
and would be given Israeli citizenship. What this means is that, in accordance
with the natural birthrate in the Palestinian family, in another generation
these newcomers would number approximately 500,000 people, and, together
with the 17 percent of Palestinians already living in Israel, would endanger
the State’s Jewish majority.
<p>All of this was not only a real threat to the existence of Israel from
the Israeli point of view, but also could be seen as contrary to the foundation
of the Oslo accords, which clearly demand concessions from the both sides
equally. From statements made by several Palestinians leaders, Arafat included,
it was clear from the beginning that in return for the creation of a Palestinian
State the Palestinians would not demand the return of refugees to Israel,
but would instead agree that they become citizens of the new Palestinian
state. Thus, according to the original terms of the Oslo Accord, the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict would officially end with existence of two independent states
in the Holy-Land—one Palestinian, and the other Jewish.
<p>But, as the late Israeli foreign minister Abba-Eban used to say: “The
Palestinians have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.”
Arafat refused the Israeli concessions at Camp David, remembering perhaps
that Palestinian violence always gave him more concessions from Israel.
Therefore he chose to initiate the so-called “Intifada El-Aqsa” armed uprising,
a step planned long before Camp-David. Arafat was right again. Barak was
not only prepared to give him more concessions after the Intifada broke
out, but he was also ready to continue negotiating with Arafat while violence
and terrorism were being carried out against Israelis on a daily basis.
And this time it was not Hamas violence doing the Palestinian Authority’s
dirty work. Rather, it was violence initiated and controlled by Arafat
himself through his own Fateh organization.
<p>However, Arafat made one mistake. He apparently did not anticipate that
the Intifada would lead to the fall of Barak’s government. When it happened,
it was clear to him that he had pulled the string too far; he cannot hope
to obtain from Sharon the concessions offered by Barak. Thus, the past
few weeks have witnessed a flurry of activity, as Arafat enthusiastically
seeks to close a deal with Israel and sign the final agreement. But by
Israeli law, an interim government cannot sign an agreement of such importance
to the future of the State. So once again, Arafat has missed the train.
<p>In the recent election, the Israeli people granted Ariel Sharon an overwhelming
majority, not only to protest the concessions that Barak was ready to give
the Palestinians, but also as a declaration of their disappointment with
the Palestinians and with Arafat. The common saying in Israel, heard everywhere
these days is, “we have no partner for peace.”
<p>Although the newly elected Prime Minister is considered one of the most
dogmatic of Israel’s leaders, he is also one of the most pragmatic. He
will probably do his utmost to achieve peace with Syria and the Palestinians.
His attempts will be determined by the character of the government that
he will be able to put together—whether it be a unity government with the
Labor party, which will give him room to make concessions to the Palestinians,
or alternately, whether it will be a right-wing government, which would
tie his hands where the peace process is concerned. But Sharon’s success
as a peace-maker will also depend on the willingness of Arafat to be pragmatic
as well, and upon his readiness to make concessions from his side.
<p>The problem is that even if Sharon does all he can to reach a settlement—agreeing
to the creation of a Palestinian state, the withdrawal of Israeli troop
from most of West Bank and Gaza Strip, and perhaps even the evacuation
of some of the Israeli settlements in there areas—he will not be able to
make the kind of concessions that Barak was prepared to give, and which
the Palestinians refused. In particular, Sharon will not be able agree
to a withdrawal from the Jordan Valley, the return of 100,000 refugees,
nor the division of Israel’s capital. It was on just these issues that
Sharon was elected; in agreeing to give what Barak was willing to give,
he would be betraying the will of the electorate.
<p>However, even though the Palestinians rejected Barak’s offer, the very
fact of its being made raised the expectations of the Palestinians. In
the absence of such concessions, the possibility of violent escalation
real. The Palestinians may well attempt to use violence in order to “break”
the Israeli government, by striking at the Israeli public morale, and this
may take the form of severe terrorist attacks in Israeli cities. In the
case of a wave of terror attacks perpetrated by the Palestinians or by
Hizballah, the resultant Israeli retaliation could set the stage for a
regional war. In such circumstances, peace in the Middle East in the near
future may well be Mission Impossible.
