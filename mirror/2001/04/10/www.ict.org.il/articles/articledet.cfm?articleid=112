<p><center><h2>Suicide Terrorism: Development &amp; Characteristics</h2></center>
<P><b>Yoram Schweitzer</b>
<BR><b>ICT</b>
<P><font size="-1">A lecture presented in the International Conference
on Countering Suicide Terrorism at ICT, Herzeliya, Israel on 21<sup>st</sup>
February, 2000</font>

<p><p>Over the past two decades suicide terrorism has become an ever-widening
phenomenon. Fifteen different terrorist organizations in twelve different
countries resorted to the use of suicide tactics against their enemies.
As of February 2000 about 275 suicide incidents occurred (<a href="#table 1">table
1</a>).
<p>When suicide terrorism was first introduced in the Middle East it seemed
that this new phenomenon was invincible and that it might change the innate
imbalance between terror groups and their rivalry governments. This did
not in fact occur.
<p>Looking at history of terrorism, it can be seen that suicide attacks
are in actuality a very old <i>modus operandi</i> . In ancient times two
notorious sects, the Jewish Sicairis and the Islamic Hashishiyun became
infamous for such attacks. In the 18<sup>th </sup>century, suicide tactics
were used on the Malabar coast of Southwestern India, in Atjeh in Northern
Sumatra and in Mindanao and Sulu in the Southern Philippines. In all of
these places Muslims carried out suicide attacks in their fight against
Western hegemony and colonial rule. [<a href="#notes">1</a>]
<p>However, contemporary suicide terrorism differs from such historical
tactics, just as the whole phenomenon of terrorism differs from ancient
modes of warfare.
<p>Modern suicide terrorism is aimed at causing devastating physical damage,
through which it inflicts profound fear and anxiety. Its goal is to produce
a negative psychological effect on an entire population rather than just
the victims of the actual attack.
<p>The relatively high number of casualties guaranteed in such attacks,
which are usually carried out in crowded areas, ensures full media coverage.
Thus, suicide terrorism, ranks with other spectacular modus operandi such
as blowing up airplanes in mid air or the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
as a sure means to win maximum effect.
<p>For the purposes of this paper a suicide terror attack is defined <i>as
a politically motivated violent attack perpetrated by a self-aware individual
(or individuals) who actively and purposely causes his own death through
blowing himself up along with his chosen target. The perpetrator’s ensured
death is a precondition for the success of his mission.</i><b> </b>(see
also Boaz Ganor’s article <a href="Define.htm">Defining Terrorism</a>)
<p>Thus this paper deals with a very specific kind of attack. It does not
deal with the very high-risk terror operations that leave only little chance
of survival to their perpetrators. Such attacks as the Japanese Red Army’s
(JRA) attack at Lod airport in 1972, Abu Nidal’s attack on a synagogue
in Istanbul in 1986 and the PFLP-GC hand-glider attack on an army barracks
in Kiryat Shmona in 1987 fall outside the scope of this paper. Also excluded
were the self-inflicted deaths of members of terrorist organization, such
as the famous leaders of the German Bader-Meinhof gang (1977) or the self-starvation
to death of Bobby Sands from the P.I.RA (1981).
<p>This paper portrays a general overview of the modern history of suicide
terror activity worldwide, focusing on its main characteristics and the
various aims and motivations of the terror groups involved.
<p>The current phenomenon of suicide terrorism has usually involved terrorists
carrying explosive charges concealed on their bodies or carried by various
vehicles, usually a car, truck or boat. In some instances the explosives
were transported by bicycle, or loaded on a pack animal (<a href="#table 3">table
3</a>).
<p><b>Hizballah suicide terrorism</b>
<p>Suicide terror attacks started in Lebanon in April 1983. A small—and
until then unknown—group by the name of Hizballah directed a number of
suicide attacks against Western targets. The first attack was directed
at the American embassy in Beirut (April 1983), followed by attacks on
the U.S. Marines headquarters and the French Multinational Force (October
1983). The last two were executed simultaneously and resulted in 300 casualties
and dozens of wounded. The later attack made an indelible impression on
world public opinion and terror organizations alike.
<p>After the withdrawal of the Western forces from Lebanon, Hizballah redirected
its suicide activities in Lebanon against Israeli Defense Forces (convoys,
posts and boarder passages) and against South Lebanese Army posts. Hizballah
henceforth significantly decreased its use of this <i>modus operandi</i>
to one attack per year or less. Despite this it enjoyed its legacy as the
pioneer of suicide bombings in the region.
<p>The aims of Hizballah suicide missions changed and developed over the
course of time. Initially, Hizballah was interested in building up it image
as a power. Since it was until then a small and little-known group in Lebanon,
let alone in the rest of the world, the introduction of this new and devastating
<i>modus
operandi</i> served the goal of gaining local and global publicity and
notoriety.
<p>Hizballah also represented its Iranian patrons with a valuable image
for the spread of the Islamic revolution. The readiness of Shi’ite terrorists,
utterly fearless and ready to sacrifice themselves for the defense of the
“oppressed on earth” was an important propagandist instrument for both
Iran and Hizballah.
<p>Hizballah’s suicide attacks were successful in driving the foreign UN
Peace Keeping forces out of Lebanon. The attacks also caused the Israeli
army to withdraw from the heartland of central Lebanon to a narrow strip
in the South.
<p>Suicide attacks also served the organization as a weapon of retaliation
and deterrence against Israel. After the Israeli Air-Force killed Hizballah’s
secretary general, Abas Musavi in February 1992, the organization carried
out a suicide attack against the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires (March
1992) killing 29 people and wounding 250.
<p>In 1994 Hizballah executed another such attack in the same city, against
the “AMIA” building of the local Jewish community in retaliation for I.D.F.
aerial attack in Lebanon against a Hizballah training camp in Ein Dardara.
<p>Lebanon had seen around 50 suicide attacks between 83-99. The Shiite
organizations, Hizballah and Amal were responsible for about half of these.
The second half is attributed to five other groups espousing a non-religious
nationalist ideology. Impressed by the effectiveness of Hizballah’s attacks
in precipitating the withdrawal of the “foreigners” from Lebanon, the nationalist
groups followed suit.
<p>Hizballah also influenced a number of terrorist organizations in other
countries. Occasionally this influence went beyond merely being a role
model.
<p>In Kuwait there two suicide attacks were attributed to El-Dawa, a local
Kuwaiti-Shiite fundamentalist group. The first suicide attack was carried
out in December 1983 as one in a series of “conventional attacks” of attacks
on American, French and Kuwaiti interests. The second attack was directed
at the Emir al-Sabah, in May 1985. Hizballah’s direct involvement was proven
when the Kuwaiti authorities arrested and tried seventeen people, among
them, Mustafa Bader-el-Din a prominent terrorist in Hizballah’s external
terror apparatus. Hizballah’s continuous and extensive efforts to release
him and his partners came to be known as the “Dawa Seventeen” affair.
<p><b>The LTTE</b>
<p>One of the groups that followed Hizballah—even exceeding it in both
execution and number of incidents—was the LTTE, the Tamil separatist group
in Sri-Lanka.
<p>The LTTE is unequivocally the most effective and brutal terrorist organization
ever to utilize suicide terrorism. Between July 1987 and February 2000
it has carried out 168 suicide terror attacks in Sri-Lanka and India leaving
thousands of innocent bystanders dead or wounded.[2] Its suicide unit,
“The Black Panthers” is comprised of both men and women. One characteristic
unique to the LTTE is the fact that every member of the group carries a
cyanide capsule around his/her neck, which he or she may consume upon capture
in order not to disclose the group’s secrets. The members of the “Black
Panthers” unit have demonstrated their continuous readiness to die when
they were surrounded by security forces. In many instances they blew themup
or bit cyanide capsules rather than risk captivity and subsequent interrogation
which could force them to betray their comrades.
<p>The LTTE has directed its attacks primarily against the highest Sri
Lankan and Indian political and military personnel. It is the only organization
that succeeded in assassinating two heads of states. Former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in May 1991 by a female suicide-bomber
while campaigning for re-election. Sri-Lanka president Prendesa was assassinated
in 1993 by a male suicide-bomber who had infiltrated the president’s inner
circle, and even lived at the president’s premises for about one year before
executing his mission.
<p>The LTTE persists in its efforts to eliminate the ruling elite in Sri-Lanka.
In December 1999 it tried to assassinate the current president, Mrs. Kumaratunga
who survived the attack but lost an eye. On 5 January 2000, the Prime Minister’s
residence was attacked by a suicide-bomber, apparently in an attempt to
assassinate the Defence Minister. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Defense
Minister was injured. The LTTE also killed several senior army commanders,
as well as prominent and Tamil politicians who cooperated with the government
in order to find a peaceful solution in Sri-Lanka.
<p>Due to the LTTE’s intensive suicide campaign, Sri Lanka politicians
seem reluctant to openly confront or declare an all-out war against the
group.
<p><b>Suicide Terrorism in Israel</b>
<p>In Israel, Suicide terrorism started in 1993.The Hamas (<i>Harkat el-Mukawma
el Islamiya</i> or “The Islamic Resistance Movement”) and the Palestinian
Islamic Jihad (PIJ) carried out about 30 suicide terror attacks which caused
about 120 fatalities and wounded hundreds.
<p>Hamas and the PIJ were also inspired and assisted by Hizballah. The
PIJ leadership maintained close relationships with Iran and Hizballah from
the early 80’s. The relationship between Hamas with Hizballah gained momentum
after Israel deported a few hundred operatives to Lebanon in 1992. There
they established a close liaison with Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary
Guards. Both groups learned suicide techniques in Lebanon.
<p>Hamas and the PIJ focused their initial suicide attacks on military
targets in the “territories” but quite rapidly shifted their attacks to
civilians in central cities and crowded areas. The two Palestinian Sunni
fundamentalist groups succeeded in inflicting a high number of casualties
among the Israeli civilian population, which had a profound negative impact
on the Israeli public’s sense of personal security. This effect was intensified
by the fact that the terror campaign accompanied a peace process, which
was supposed to bring tranquility to the relationships between Israelis
and Palestinians. Another influential factor was the continuity of the
attacks; sometimes they were a weekly occurrence. The suicide factor in
the Palestinian terror campaign thus had strategic ramifications on the
Israel-Palestinian peace-process.
<p>At the beginning of March 2000, Hamas attempted to carry out 3 to 5
suicide attacks in Israeli cities. The operation was thwarted when Israeli
security forces liquidated the cell before it could act. Two of the cell’s
leaders escaped and were later caught in Nablus by the Palestinian security
forces as part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
<p><b>Egyptian Terrorism</b>
<p>The Egyptian terror groups also contributed their share to the suicide
phenomenon. Each of the two leading groups, the Gama’a al-Islamiya and
the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (Jihad Group) carried out one attack. The Gama’a
al-Islamiya operated in Croatia in October 1995, attacking a local police
station in Rijake. This was a retaliatory act to the disappearance of one
of the group’s leaders in Croatia and his eventual extradition to Egypt.
The Jihad Group used two suicide bombers to destroy the Egyptian embassy
in Pakistan causing 15 fatalities and wounding dozens (November 1995).
This was attack too was in retaliation for Pakistani-Egyptian cooperation
in extraditing terrorists to Egypt.
<p>It should be noticed that both groups avoided using such tactics on
Egyptian soil. This can be attributed to their reluctance to alienate their
constituency in Egypt by causing the indiscriminate death of innocent bystanders.
The greater efficiency of the security forces in Egypt as compared to that
in other countries may also have played a role.
<p><b>The PKK</b>
<p>Another group that has used suicide terror attacks in the past is the
Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK). The PKK has carried out a total of 21 suicide
attacks or attempted attacks (15 attacks were actually carried out and
6 were intercepted). Its suicide campaign started on 30<sup> </sup>June
1996 and ceased on 5 July 1999 at the decision of its leader Abdullah Ocalan.
This terror campaign caused relatively low casualties: 19 were killed and
138 were wounded.[<a href="#notes">3</a>]
<p>The PKK resorted to suicide terrorism at a time when it was facing heavy
military setbacks in Southeast Turkey, which had had an adverse effect
on the moral of its members. Since the group’s terrorist activities have
declined constantly between 1994-1996 the organization was seeking an effective
means to reverse this trend and to boost the moral of its fighters. Suicide
missions were therefore chosen as a consolidating tool. They served as
a demonstration of the PKK’s capability to operate and to damage their
enemies. The attacks demonstrated the supreme willingness to sacrifice
everything, including one’s life for the Kurdish national goals. For some
time, such attacks were used for retaliatory purposes.
<p><b>Al-Qaida</b>
<p>al-Qaida headed by Osama bin Ladin is the last group to have resorted
to suicide attacks and has a close operational connection to the Egyptian
groups. Al-Qaida was responsible for two of the most spectacular and lethal
suicide attacks in recent times. The simultaneous attacks against the American
embassies in Nairobi and in Dar-e-Salaam in August 1998 resulted in 300
fatalities and five thousands wounded, most of them innocent local bystanders.
(<a href="#table 2">tables 2 and 3.</a>)
<p><b>The role of women in suicide terrorism</b>
<p>Women have played an important role in the terrorist activity of some
of the prominent groups that use suicide terrorism. In general this prominence
is limited to the organizations with a nationalist orientation. The fundamentalist
Islamic terror groups have never let women to take part in their terrorist
activities, let alone in suicide terrorism.
<p>The nationalist groups, such as the PKK, the LTTE and the P.P.S. enable
women to participate in their most extreme modus operandi. The leaders
of these groups often exploit the female members’ profound desire to prove
equality with their male peers and encourage—some times even manipulate
them—to “volunteer” for such missions.
<p>Women’s share in suicide attacks was in high percentage: In the LTTE
they participated in about 30% to 40% of the group’s overall suicide activities.
In the PKK, women carried out 11 out of 15 attacks, while the perpetrators
of 3 out 6 attacks that were intercepted were women. (a total of 14 out
of 21 suicide attacks, or 66 % of the total ). In the P.P.S./S.S.N.P. (Syrian
Sicialist Nationalist Party) women took part in 5 out of the group’s 12
suicide activities.
<p>The reasons for using women in particular in this kind of operation
evolved from a variety of considerations on the part of the organizations.
However, all of them, deceptively used the innocent appearance of a “pregnant”
woman in order to by-pass the heavy security arrangements while approaching
their targets. All of them dwell on women’s desire to prove their abilities
and devotion to the organization and to their supreme leader. In several
cases, especially in P.P.S there were romantic feelings involved.
<p><b><font size=+1>Concluding remarks:</font></b>
<p>Looking at suicide terrorism from a perspective of seventeen years one
may conclude that it has not been a “winning card” in the hands of terror
organizations, nor has it changed dramatically the inherent imbalance between
states and terror organizations in favor of the terrorists. However, it
was proven to be an effective instrument in the service of the terrorist’s
agenda.
<p>In certain situations invothe presence of military forces on foreign
soil or during a delicate period of political negotiations during a peace-process,
suicide attacks may have a profound negative influence. For example, Hizballah
was successful in its campaign to expel the M.N.F. from Lebanon. Hamas
was successful in delaying the implementation of the Oslo accords in the
Middle East and the LTTE succeeded in halting the deployment of the Indian
peace keeping troops to Sri-Lanka and the subsequent postponement of the
peace-talks in Sri-Lanka.
<p>However, most of the groups that were involved in suicide terrorism
either stopped using it or eventually reduced it significantly. Thus, suicide
terrorism is not increasing though it may spread in future to other areas
of conflict given the “copy-cat” nature of terrorism.
<p>The greatest potential risk suicide terrorism may pose in future is
if terrorists carry out operations combined with other spectacular tactics
such as blowing up airplanes or the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
Such a combination will increase immensely the death toll of a single terror
attack and will have a shocking psychological effect on public moral. At
this level suicide terrorism would constitute a genuine strategic threat
and would probably be confronted as such.
