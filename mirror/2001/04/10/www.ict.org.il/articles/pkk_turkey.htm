<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Showdown Between the PKK and Turkey:</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Syria’s Setback</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Dr. Ely Karmon, ICT</FONT></B>

<P><B>Introduction</B>
<BR>During the last two years, the Turkish army has waged a relentless
offensive activity against the PKK military and guerrilla infrastructure,
mainly in Northern Iraq. The Turkish army has sent thousand of soldiers
to fight the PKK guerrillas in the harsh mountainous regions of Kurdistan,
near the border with Iraq and Syria.

<P>At the same time Turkey has brought to bear increasing political and
diplomatic pressure on the governments of Iran and Syria, the main sponsors
and logistics providers for PKK's guerrilla and terrorist activity inside
Turkey itself.

<P><B>The military-political front</B>
<BR>The last military operation in northern Iraq began at the end of May
1998, when 15,000 thousand soldiers and 2,000 village guards (of Kurdish
origin) joined in the pursuit of PKK guerrillas. This operation can be
seen as the final turning point in the fierce struggle between the two
sides, which began in 1984.

<P>According to an official Turkish report published in June 1998[<A HREF="#notes">1</A>],
22,129 PKK members were killed by Turkish security forces in 31,343 separate
incidents between May 1984 and May 1998. The report stresses that since
1996 there has been a sharp decline in terrorist incidents across Turkey
and that in the first five months of 1998 699 terrorists were killed, 146
were captured and 45 were wounded; 41 gave themselves up to the security
forces.

<P>These numbers increased during the following weeks, as did the number
of PKK militants who gave themselves up, either to the Turkish authorities
or to the rival Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP). The KDP is also active
in northern Iraq, but is allied to Turkey. According to the Iranian press
agency[<A HREF="#notes">2</A>], from the 60 such militants who defected
with all their military equipment to the KDP, twenty were commanders who
were in possession of maps showing PKK plans to launch an extensive attack
in northern Iraq.

<P>At the same time the PKK suffered continuing setbacks to its ability
to carry out guerrilla activity inside Turkey. In July 1998 its new infrastructure
in the southeastern province of Gaziantep was neutralized and in August
the same happened in the Amanos Mountain region.

<P>In May 1998 three PKK militants surrendered to the Turkish embassy in
Beirut, Lebanon, and gave ample information about the training they received
in training camps Lebanon’s Beka'a Valley.

<P>The PKK leadership acknowledged, even if indirectly, the military setbacks
it had suffered. In a report by London MED TV Television (pro-PKK)[<A HREF="#notes">3</A>],
the ARGK (People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan) was asked for a more rigorous
implementation of the guerrilla approach of the PKK's military line, in
order that more successful results could be achieved. According to the
report, The PKK leader, Ocalan, pointed out in his instructions to ARGK
that similar opportunities [as those during the May Turkish offensive]
were not well used in past years and stressed that the level reached during
this month must be raised further!

<P>Only two weeks later, Kani Yilmaz, the PKK's representative in Europe,
declared that his organization was ready to put an end to its armed rebellion,
if Ankara would recognize the PKK as a legitimate political organization.

<P>Then, at the beginning of July, Akif Hasan, European policy spokesman
of the ERNK (National Liberation Front of Kurdistan), declared that the
PKK wanted a peaceful solution and dialogue with Ankara. Its objective
was no longer a state but far-reaching autonomy within the borders of Turkey--such
as the Basques had been granted in Spain[<A HREF="#notes">4</A>]. He boasted
that the PKK still had 10,000 men in arms, but that the organization had
changed tactics. Its units no longer comprised groups of up to 500 fighters,
but only up to 50, making it more difficult to spot them! Moreover, he
said, at the moment, the PKK was not interested in escalating the war because
it wanted to leave room for negotiations.

<P>Finally, at a 10-day meeting of ARGK commanders in mid-July, PKK leader
Ocalan, said that the expanded command council “comprehensively discussed
and resolved the problems of the general guerrilla and party lines and
not only of the recent period.” He underlined “the problems concerning
the struggle command style and headquarters issues and… on the basis of
his assessments stated that he will assume with greater power than ever
the duties of general commander in ideological, political, and military
terms.”[<A HREF="#notes">5</A>]

<P>After various hints by PKK representatives in Europe and by Abdullah
Ocalan himself, the real change in the PKK's stand came at the beginning
of September. The PKK leader announced a unilateral cease-fire in a telephone
interview on Kurdish MED TV adding that the cease-fire would last until
April 1999 (See <A HREF="#annex1">Annex 1</A> below).

<P>Ocalan has announced similar cease-fires on two occasions--in 1993 and
in 1995. Turkey has so far rejected all such offers and refused to negotiate
with the group. Recently Ocalan claimed that he no longer sought to separate
the mainly Kurdish southeast from Turkey and that following a realistic
policy of Kurdish independence does not mean changing the borders.

<P>This time, too, the Turkish government ignored the cease-fire. Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz declared that Turkey would never agree to negotiate
with the PKK and called on Ocalan to surrender. Yilmaz added that the efforts
of the PKK to create a political platform in Europe would be in vain.

<P><B>The international political arena</B>
<BR>In contrast to the PKK's setbacks in Turkey itself and in northern
Iraq, the organization has witnessed real political success and a come-back
on the international arena, mainly in Western Europe.

<P>The best analysis of this paradoxical situation was done, in my opinion,
by the former Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Sukru Elekdag.[<A HREF="#notes">6</A>]
Therefore, I will take the liberty to cite at length from his two articles
published in mid-August 1998.

<P>According to Elekdag, “a realistic assessment of the threat that the
Southeast problem poses to [Turkey], can only be made by examining its
international dimension. The PKK has been very successful in organizing
overseas. Associations formed as PKK affiliates by the Kurdish diaspora
in European countries have waged extremely effective propaganda against
Turkey and have provided the PKK with major financial resources. Moreover,
representative offices of ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan],
which is the PKK's political wing, have been operating as diplomatic missions
in Athens, Vienna, Oslo, Brussels, Helsinki, Copenhagen, and Stockholm.
Meetings held by the 'Kurdish Parliament in Exile' in European capitals
have provided extensive propaganda opportunities to the PKK. The PKK, which
maintains a camp near Moscow, has an 'official dialog' with the Russian
parliament. Led by Greek and Armenian lobbies, Kurdish associations are
engaged in anti-Turkish activities in the United States.”

<P>This international status allows the PKK to exercise its influence in
the framework of the Council of Europe, in the European Parliament, and
through international human rights organizations. Thus the PKK has put
political pressure on Turkey and has been able even to bring about an open
and undeclared arms embargo imposed against Turkey.

<P>“Against this background,” writes ambassador Elekdag, “efforts to give
the PKK the status of a political organization suddenly gathered momentum
in Europe last year. First, in a unanimous decision, the European Parliament
called upon the European Union to act 'to find a political solution to
the Kurdish problem.' Then, the Federal Chief Prosecutor of Germany declared
that the PKK can no longer be considered a terrorist organization and that
it will be treated as an organization bent on committing crimes against
the law. In this connection, German Foreign Minister Kinkel said, 'If Apo
[Abdullah Ocalan] renounces terrorism, we will accept him as an interlocutor
and talk to him.' Some time later it was reported that European intelligence
agencies also adopted this approach.”[<A HREF="#notes">7</A>]

<P>Elekdag's conclusion is that “when the internal and external dimensions
of the Southeast problem are evaluated together, the picture that emerges
is … much darker then” if we take into consideration only the military
dimension:
<UL>
<LI>
The southeast problem is assuming an international dimension. There are
growing prospects that some European countries will recognize the PKK as
an organization engaged in a national liberation struggle. In the event
of such a development, the battle against the PKK will become extremely
difficult, and Turkey may come under severe pressure to accept a political
solution. Thus, hitting the PKK hard in the field does not mean that it
is collapsing.</LI>

<LI>
No progress has been made in the solution of the fundamental problem and
indeed the Southeast problem is the highest priority and most urgent threat
against Turkey.</LI>
</UL>
The former Turkish ambassador asks therefore his government to act quickly
and take serious preventive measures, in two important fields:
<UL>
<LI>
On the internal arena “the prerequisite for the establishment of societal
security and peace in the Southeast is to overcome poverty, unemployment,
and illiteracy. To that end, a socioeconomic development plan that will
bring bread and work to the Southeast and build a modern infrastructure
there must begin to be implemented without delay…”</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The second essential determinant for the resolution of the Kurdish problem
and the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the Southeast would be
to “force Syria to expel [Abdullah] Ocalan, who is the leader and symbol
of terrorism in [Turkey], and his organization to a country that does not
have any borders with Turkey and to end its support for the PKK completely.
The PKK’s will to fight can be broken only by crushing the head of the
snake in Syria…To achieve this goal Turkey must exercise its right of self-defense
and resort to countermeasures that target the interests of Damascus and
must demonstrate that it is determined to escalate such measures until
the desired result is achieved.”</LI>
</UL>
Elekdag estimates that the international climate permits Turkey to implement
in stages a political and strategic concept to achieve these goals: “since
the attack on US embassies in Africa, the view that has gained dominance
in Washington is that there is no way to fight against terrorism except
by applying the principle of ‘a tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye’ .
. .Moreover, the political and strategic force balance in the region is
in Turkey's favor”, mainly as a result of the Turkish-Israeli strategic
alliance.[<A HREF="#notes">8</A>]

<P><B>The Turkish strategy</B>
<BR>The Turkish government and military command have no doubt always understood
the dilemma facing them in dealing with such a complex situation. Past
experience with the Syrian regime has also taught the Turkish authorities
that they cannot rely on the framework of existing agreements and bilateral
security committees. These were never respected by the Syrians or were
used mainly as a lever to pressure Turkey on the issue of water reserves.

<P>Thus Turkey used the information provided by several PKK senior prisoners,
such as Semdin Sakik or by deserters in order to publicly expose Syrian
support and involvement--directly or through its stronghold in Lebanon--in
its sponsorship of the PKK. Sakik revealed during interrogation that PKK
enjoys freedom of movement in Syria, it acquired SAM-7 missiles through
Syria and that president Hafez al-Assad’s brother, Cemil (sic), allowed
the organization to exploit the state’s resources.[<A HREF="#notes">9</A>]

<P>Turkey also stepped-up its diplomatic pressure on countries were PKK
political and logistical infrastructure is active and which serve as a
basis for terrorist activity against Turkey. Ankara convinced the Rumanian
government to take action against the PKK infrastructure in that country
and arrest or expel militants involved in clandestine or criminal activities.[<A HREF="#notes">10</A>]
It recalled its ambassador to Rome after the Italian parliament hosted
the meeting of the “Kurdish Parliament in Exile”.

<P>On this background, Turkey opted for a confrontation with Syria at the
end of September 1998, by concentrating troops on their common border.
As the Egyptian president Housni Mubarak tried to mediate in the crisis
and after the Syrians showed no willingness to bow to the Turkish demands,
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz declared at the beginning of October that the
government might request parliamentary consent for a war with Syria. The
Turkish Prime Minister said that Syria had been supporting terrorism for
14 years, but is denying it. He added that Turkey has the right to self
defense. In a rare display of unity, all political parties in Parliament
approved a declaration calling on Syria to cut its support for the PKK
and to be ready to "bear the consequences" of Turkey's response if it does
not do so. As the Syrian administration had not responded to these calls
the Turkish president Suleiman Demirel threatened in a virtual ultimatum
that if Damascus continued to support the PKK's terrorism, Turkey would
use military force.

<P>At this stage Syria bent under the pressure and Turkey claimed an important
victory as it forced Damascus to drop its support for the PKK and expel
its leader Ocalan from Syria. The <A HREF="syria-turkey.htm">agreement</A>
was reached during a special security meeting between Turkey and Syria
held in Adana, Turkey, on 19-20 Oct. 1998. According to the text, Syria
promised not to permit the activity of training camps on its territory,
to arrest and bring to justice PKK terrorists and not to allow PKK propaganda,
or armament, logistic and financial support to the organization. Syria
agreed not to allow the return of Ocalan to its territory. It was also
decided to discuss the struggle with the PKK terrorism on a tripartite
framework following the consent of Lebanon. The two sides decided to establish
mechanisms to enforce these measures, including a red telephone line between
the high-level security authorities of the countries.[<A HREF="#notes">11</A>]

<P>According to <I>The Guardian</I>, Turkish military officials were still
suspicious of the Syrian president after the signing of the agreement,
so he has been given limited time to live up to his promises. These officials
see the Syrian new stand as only one battle in a wider war and signaled
that Ankara will use more aggressive diplomacy in the future to combat
the influence of Kurdish groups based abroad.[<A HREF="#notes">12</A>]

<P>This new brand of Turkish “muscle” diplomacy was indeed tested immediately
after the signing of the agreement with Syria, but this time in order to
obtain Ocalan’s extradition from Russia, and then from Italy. It transpired
that Ocalan left Damascus for Russia and asked for political asylum in
the country that once was the ideological motherland of the PKK. But in
spite of the Communist-controlled Duma’s resolution to approve Ocalan’s
demand, the Russian government took seriously the Turkish diplomatic and
economic pressures and asked him to leave its territory.

<P>Ocalan arrived in Italy using a falsified passport and was arrested
by the police. The showdown between Turkey and Italy has only begun. It
will be interesting to see its outcome, taking into consideration the Turkish
resolve, the Italian tradition for giving political asylum and not defying
terrorist organizations and PKK’s veiled threats to avenge a future extradition
of Ocalan to Turkey.

<P><B>Summary</B>
<BR>Turkey’s move against Syria, one of the main sponsor states of international
terrorism, although not pilloried as such by the US State Department, has
proved that a firm stand combining diplomatic and military pressure can
achieve satisfactory results in the new international environment. Smaller
states can and must imitate the American example in dealing with the phenomenon
and actively press sponsor states to stop every support they give to terrorist
organizations

<P>The continuing Syrian support for Hizballah’s guerrilla and terrorist
activity from Southern Lebanon against Israel and its sheltering of all
the Palestinian terrorist organizations opposing the political process,
should lead the Israeli government to review its strategy in dealing with
this paradoxical situation and learn from the Turkish example and resolve.

<TD><B>National Liberation Front of Kurdistan (ERNK) Press Release</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>September 2, 1998</B>&nbsp;
<BR>The Kurdish national liberation , led by the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK), due to its support from the people, its institutionalization, its
organizational heroics, and its international clarity and prestige, has
reached a high point.&nbsp;

<P>The Kurdish people, from the beginning, had no alternative but to wage
a war to protect their identity, due to the fact that nearly all fundamental
human rights were denied to them by the Turkish state. After 14 years of
fighting, the dirty war being waged by the Turkish army has not only drenched
our land in blood, it has also caused the Turkish people to live in unacceptable
conditions. The war has given rise to a Mafia which profits from death.
This criminal network has infiltrated the&nbsp;
<BR>highest ranks of the Turkish state.&nbsp;

<P>The Kurdish question has become an international question, and the calls
for peace, from both the Kurdish and Turkish peoples, have reached a crescendo.
Turkish mothers have begun to protest against seeing their sons return
home dead. At this moment, when the military success of the PKK is at a
high point, the President of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, has declared a unilateral
ceasefire to coincide with International Peace Day on September 1.&nbsp;

<P>This ceasefire has been called to initiate a dialogue to seek a just
solution, an alternative to war, and to seriously consider proposals from
both inside and outside the country. Although the PKK will fulfill its
responsibilities in line with the ceasefire, there are serious tasks to
be undertaken by international circles as well as by the Turkish people
and their political leaders. Without a doubt, the most important responsibility
of the ceasefire is to open a space for a political solution with the Turkish
state and the forces within it. It is important that the ceasefire be taken
seriously and not dismissed with propaganda such as "the PKK have been
weakened" or other provocative measures designed to manipulate public opinion.&nbsp;

<P>We call on international bodies such as the European Parliament and
the OSCE, who have repeatedly called for a dialogue and a political solution,
including a ceasefire, to initiate concrete steps and to support this ceasefire.&nbsp;

<P>We call on Western states to initiate similar steps and we feel compelled
to remind them of their responsibilities.&nbsp;

<P>The Kurdish people have united behind their party and they shall continue
to offer their support and make all sort of sacrifices for the struggle.
In conclusion, the ERNK calls upon all involved states, institutions, organization,
groups, and people, and most of all the Turkish state, to fulfill their
responsibilities with respect to the ceasefire.&nbsp;
