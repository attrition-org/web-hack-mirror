<P><b>Translated by Reuven Paz, ICT, from “al-Ayam” (Qatar), 23/4/96.</b>

<P>The Interior and Justice Ministers of the 22 Arab States within the
League of Arab States, signed on April 22<SUP>nd</SUP> 1998, for the first

by the Secretary of the League as a unique achievement.

<P><B>The Main Principles Of The Accord:</B>

condemns violence and terrorism and stresses the defense of human rights
and cooperation between societies for the sake of peace.</LI>

Commitment to the rules of the covenant of the League of Arab States, of
the UN, International Law and all other related international agreements.
These are all the wellsping of international society in its pursuit of
peace and security for all.</LI>

<LI>
Differentiation between terrorist crimes and the struggle against foreign
occupation and aggression, according to the principles of International

Intensification of the Arab cooperation and coordination in the judicial
security fields, and the creation of a common ground for this coordination
by accepted bases to the judicial means of operations.</LI>

<LI>
Coordination between the terms of this accord and the laws and steps taken
by every individual state, in order to fulfill the common national aims
of this accord.</LI>
</OL>
<B>The Main Terms Of The Accord:</B>
<OL>
<LI>
The members of the League commit themselves not to use their lands as an
arena for planning, organizing or carrying out terrorist crimes of any
kind nor take part in such activity. This includes the prevention of infiltration
of terrorist elements into their lands or the sojourn upon them of individuals
as well as groups, nor accommodation, training, finance, arms or any other
assistance.</LI>

<LI>
The members of the League, mainly those which have common borders, commit
themselves to coordinate the means of Counter-Terrorism, including the
arrest of terrorists and bringing them to judgment according to their national
laws, or surrendering them according to this accord or bilateral accords.</LI>

<LI>
The exchange of information, researches and experience among the members
of the League, and conducting of common training courses in order to promote
the scientific and practical abilities of those who work in the field of
Counter-Terrorism.</LI>

by any other state member of the League, in accordance with accepted and

</OL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Commentary by Reuven Paz - ICT</FONT></B>

<P>This accord was achieved after two years of intensive discussions on
different levels, on the initiative of the Egyptian regime. It is aimed
mainly against Radical and Islamic Fundamentalist Terrorism, which is partially
assisted by various Arab states.

<P>An interesting point in the accord is the fact that there is no procedure
to arrive at common judicial rules nor to create a common judicial institution.
Rather the emphasis is on the judicial independence of every state. There
is also no procedure to build a common apparatus for Counter-Terrorism,
such as were established in the past for the coordination of the war against
Israel or the economic Arab boycott over Israel. This is probably due to
an absence of Arab unity in the 1990s and the differences of opinion among
the various states concerning Islamic Law.

<P>The only reference here to Israel is the differentiation between Terrorism
and the struggle against occupation. It gives legitimacy to Palestinian
Islamic Terrorism against Israel by organizations some of which are colleagues
of terrorist groups in the Arab states or sponsored by other Arab regimes.

<P>What importance this accord has lies in the fact that it was signed
after so long a debate. We cannot estimate that it will have any real effect
on Islamic Terrorist activity. There are too many contradictory interests
between various Arab states, in which the Islamists are involved.
