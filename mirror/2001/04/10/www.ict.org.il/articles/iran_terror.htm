<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Iran’s Policy on Terrorism in the 1990s</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>By Ely Karmon,</B>
<BR><B>ICT Senior Research Scholar</B>

<P><I>This paper was presented on May 10, 1998 at the International Conference
on Recent Trends in Research on Terror and the Fight against Terror in
Memory of the late Professor Avner Yaniv at the Department of Political
Science, Haifa University.</I>

<P><I>An updated and edited version of this article will be published in
the Middle East Quarterly.</I>

<P>The US Department of State’s report “Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1997,”
released in April 1998, states that “notwithstanding some conciliatory
statements in the months after President Khatami's inauguration in August
1997, Iran remains the most active state sponsor of terrorism [from a list
of seven governments accused of sponsoring international terrorism]. There
is no evidence that Iranian policy has changed, and Iran continues both
to provide significant support to terrorist organizations and to assassinate
dissidents abroad.”

<P>In 1996 the German judicial authorities accused the highest echelons
of the Iranian regime of being responsible for the assassination of four
Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin on September 12, 1992. In April 1997
a German court concluded that the Iranian government was directly implicated
in these murders (the so-called Mikonos affair). This being the case, one
would expect from the Iranian government a more cautious policy in the
sensitive field of sponsoring international terrorism. Yet, throughout
1997 Iranian agencies conducted at least 13 assassinations of opposition
militants abroad, mainly in Iraq; its leadership raised the reward offered
for executing the <I>fatwa</I> on the author of <I>The Satanic Verses</I>,
Salman Rushdie, to $2.5 million; and in September 1997 the new leadership
reaffirmed the <I>fatwa</I>.

<P>The same great expectations that welcomed Khatami’s election to the
presidency were aroused after the death of the Islamic Revolution’s leader,
Ayatollah Khomeini, in 1989, with the accession to power of President Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani too, was considered in his time to
be a moderate leader who would usher in a new policy of peace and restoration
of normal relations with the outside world. The question then arises, what
induces the Iranian regime to follow what seems at first glance such a
counterproductive policy in the international arena, and if Khatami’s term
as president will bring any real change in the strategic use of terrorism
as a tool in Iran’s foreign policy.

<P><B>Terrorism in the service of religious ideology</B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+0>Basically, Iran’s ideological doctrine, its strategic
aims and its political interests have not changed since Khomeini’s ascent
to power in 1979. However, their implementation has been adapted to the
changing global and international developments and the internal economic
and social constraints in Iran itself. In essence, Iran has used terrorism
since the advent of the revolutionary Islamic regime in order to achieve
these aims and has seen terrorism as a legitimate weapon in its foreign
policy.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the internal level, the Iranian Islamic revolutionary
ideology strives to establish a model Muslim society that would solve the
economic, social and political afflictions of the people. On the international
level, its chief aim is to export and spread the Islamic message to the
oppressed Muslims all over the world so as to convince and help them to
carry out their own revolution.[<A HREF="#1">1</A>] The export of the revolution
is regarded by the regime’s staunchest defenders of the Islamic ideology
(the so called “conservatives” and “radicals”) as the main goal of Iranian
foreign policy.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the same ideological context, the struggle against
all alien ideological and cultural influences, primarily against the Western
predominance over the Islamic nations, has led Iran to adopt <I>Jihad</I>
against “heretics” everywhere. This has been directed mainly against the
United States and its allies. The Iranian leaders’ call to all Muslims
to unite under the banner of <I>Jihad</I>, to stand against the great powers
and repel the “imperialist onslaught” has been heard by many Shi’a, and
later also Sunni, radical movements in the Middle East and afar.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For Khomeini and his followers Israel is not only “the
Small Satan,” an unnatural creature of Britain and the United States implanted
on sacred Arab and Muslim soil, but also “the state of the infidel Jews
who humiliates Islam, the Quran, the government of Islam and the nation
of Islam.”[<A HREF="#2">2</A>]&nbsp; Its destruction is therefore a sacred
duty for every true Muslim.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>From the strategic point of view, Iran is and considers
itself to be an important power in the Gulf region, in the Middle East
and in the area of the Muslim countries of the CIS, with legitimate interests
to defend and expand. Although these interests are presented as subordinated
to the more elevated Islamic values, in fact they represent the nationalistic
facet of the Iranian regime. Unfortunately there is no place in this paper
for a detailed evaluation of the influence these conflicting ideologies
have on the policy of the Iranian government.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There is consensus in academia and among political observers
that the regimes as such is on the whole stable and there is no serious
threat to it from the weak Iranian opposition. However, the economic and
social hardships of the last years and the growing disillusion from the
unfulfilled promises of the revolution, have led the Iranian government
to be worried by a possible deterioration in the situation and the distancing
of the people from the religion itself. The growing internal difficulties
compel it to be vigilant at home as well as abroad, and by the Iranian
standards this means to strike hard at the “enemies of the revolution”.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the eyes of the Iranian regime the liquidation of opposition
and dissident leaders and militants is seen as a legitimate action in the
defense of Islam.&nbsp; According to the Khomeinist doctrine the revolution
and Islam are one, and therefore the fidelity to the regime is a duty to
Islam itself. An offense against the regime is an offense to Islam and
must be punished, be the offender in Iran or abroad. This is one of the
central motives behind the indoctrination effort of the regime in order
to keep the unity of the revolutionary camp and to fight its enemies.[<A HREF="#3">3</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The implementation of the <I>fatwa</I> against Salman
Rushdie, his assassination or that of those propagating his writings, be
they Muslims or not, is considered a religious duty for all the Muslim
<I>ummah </I>and a legitimate act of justice, whose role is to bolster
the regime’s revolutionary zeal and that of the devotees inside and outside
Iran. In this case the attacks on non-Muslims, even against Christians
on Christian “territory”, is a sacred task, even if it implies a conflict
with the local authorities. As the <I>fatwa</I> was issued by Khomeini
himself and the spiritual leader of the revolution is dead, no politician
in the Iranian regime would dare to annul the <I>vilaya al-faqui’s </I>ruling,
even if he wanted to. This paradox stands at the bottom of the unresolved
conflict poisoning the relations between Europe and Iran for almost a decade.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In this framework it is of interest to analyze and compare
Iran’s policy of the use of terrorism for furthering its ideological, strategic
and political goals during the Khomeini era and during that of Khamene’i
and Rafsanjani’s. This will permit us to better evaluate the realities
and the obstacles faced by the new president and their weight in any change
in Iran’s terrorism policy.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Iran has been on the list of states sponsoring terrorism
already throughout the 1980s. However, while other countries, like Cuba,
Syria and Libya have paid quite a high price for their involvement in international
terrorism, Iran has continued and even intensified its terrorist activity,
and from the beginning of the 1990s has emerged as the leading “power”
in this field. A short statistical analysis will prove the point:[<A HREF="#4">4</A>]</FONT>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>During the years 1979-1996 some 70 Iranian opposition leaders
and activists have been assassinated by Iranian agents or proxy agents,
i.e. terrorists belonging to radical Islamic groups and organizations.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>30 Iranian opposition activistwere murdered in the 11 years
after the revolution (1979-1990), while during the years 1991-1996 more
than 40 were assassinated, which means that about 65% were eliminated during
Rafsanjani’s administration period.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=+0>A no less interesting picture arises from the analysis of
the countries that were chosen by the Iranians for the perpetration of
their terrorist attacks against the opposition:</FONT>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>27 opposition activists were assassinated in various countries
of the world in 23 terrorist attacks mounted in the period 1991-1996 (the
rest of the 13 murdered were attacked in Iraq or the Iraqi Kurdistan).
13 more innocent people were killed or injured during these attacks. A
Japanese translator of Rushdie’s book was killed and the Norwegian and
Italian publishers of the same book were wounded.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>70% of the 23 attacks were perpetrated in three countries:
Germany (4), France (4) and Turkey (8), by all standards, important countries.
France and Germany were leading at the time the “critical dialogue” between
the European Union and Iran and were the most sympathetic and helpful to
Iran’s political, financial and economic claims during the difficult negotiations
between the two sides. Turkey is a regional secular power with which Iran
shares conflicting strategic interests but also important economic stakes.</FONT></LI>

<OL>&nbsp;</OL>
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Looking to the graph of the yearly activities, other results
emerge:</FONT>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>During the long period of the Gulf crisis and the war itself
(October 1990 - April 1991) no Iranian terrorist activity was registered
and almost no serious attacks by its radical Islamic proxies, apart from
several attacks in Turkey against American targets. Immediately after the
end of the war a series of assassination of opposition militants occurred,
the most conspicuous being the murder of the ex-prime minister Shapour
Bahtiar in August 1991 in Paris.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>During the period 1991-1996, the year that registered an
astonishing decline in terror attacks was 1995, with only one major assassination
attack.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>In 1996 there was a sharp resurgence in the Iranian activity
together with a return to the old trend of the 1980s - indiscriminate terrorist
attacks against civil targets. In March a huge mortar was discovered on
an Iranian ship in Antwerp (Belgium} specially designed by the Iranian
military industry for the bombing of a civilian target in Germany or France
(it is not clear if it was intended to attack an important opposition target
or an Israeli embassy). In May, a similar mortar was discovered in Baghdad,
pointed to the headquarters of Mujahedin-e Halq (MEK), an Iranian opposition
terrorist organization.[<A HREF="#5">5</A>]&nbsp; During spring 1996 Iran
was probably behind the suicide attacks of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad (PIJ), which seriously hampered the peace-process in the Middle East.
Last but not least, there are also indications and some evidence that Iran
was involved in the suicide bombing of the al-Khobar Towers in Dharhan,
which killed 19 American military personnel.[<A HREF="#6">6</A>]</FONT></LI>

<OL>&nbsp;</OL>
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=+0>In its first years, the Iranian revolutionary regime brutally
attacked, mainly through its proxies, American and Western targets--one
should remember the deadly suicide attacks launched by Hizballah against
the American embassy, the Marines’ headquarters and the French troops in
Beirut and the kidnapping of many British and American citizens in Lebanon,
or the hijacking by Shi’a terrorist groups of so many planes during that
period. Nevertheless, it has been careful not to directly strike at such
targets during the 1990s, apart from the attacks against individuals connected
with the publication of Rushdie’s book. As previously mentioned, it seems
that 1996 marked a change in this policy, as proved by the use of a “supermortar”
in an European country which would have resulted in the death of many innocent
local victims, and the possible involvement in the Dharhan attack.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is very interesting to note that prior to 1992 Iran
(or even Hizballah) did not attack <I>any</I> Israeli or Jewish targets
abroad and preferred instead to encourage Hizballah to strike at Israeli
military objectives in Lebanon. But after the Madrid Peace Conference of
October 1991 a spate of deadly attacks was launched against Israeli as
well as Jewish targets throughout the world:</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Turkish Islamic terrorists connected with Iranian agents
or trained by the Iranians were involved in most of the incidents on Turkish
soil. In Bangkok an Iranian citizen was sentenced to life imprisonment
for his part in the terrorist attempt there, but was recently released
after heavy Iranian pressure was put on the Thai government. There is some
evidence that Hizballah was behind the two suicide bombings in Buenos Aires
and that Iran was also involved.[<A HREF="#7">7</A>]</FONT>

<P><B>The strategic and political rationale behind Iran’s policy in the
1990s</B>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>What<B> </B>then<B> </B>lies behind this pattern of behavior
of the Iranian leadership? First, it should be remembered that Iran has
achieved important strategic, political and economic assets through its
tough terrorist policy of the 1980s:</FONT></LI>

<LI VALUE="1">
<FONT SIZE=+0>The American, French and virtually all Western troops were
expelled from Lebanon and Iran obtained a military stronghold in the country,
so important from the point of view of the Shi’ia revolutionary regime.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Hizballah, Iran’s creature and obedient ally, became a major
player in Lebanese politics and its best tool in the fight against the
“Zionist enemy”.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>The affair of the kidnapped Americans and Europeans helped
“cleanse” Lebanon of all Western influence and also brought some economic
and military bonanza (see for instance the Irangate affair,).</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>The series<B> </B>of terrorist attacks staged by Iranian
agents in France in 1985-1986 and the pressure brought by them on the French
government helped to reduce the military assistance given by France to
Iraq, still at war with Iran at the time. It also helped to resolve the
dispute concerning the financial assets frozen in French banks in Iran’s
favor.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Finally, Iran’s standing in the Gulf, the Middle East and
all over the Muslim world, was greatly enhanced, making Iran a model and
a patron for many of the radical Islamic groups which emerged in the region,
Shi’a and Sunni alike.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=+0>The election of Rafsanjani to the presidency in 1989, after
Khomeini’s death and the end of the war with Iraq, had raised hopes in
the West that he would be willing and able to change the revolutionary
trend and pursue a more moderate foreign policy. At the same time, most
of the conflicting issues on the agenda (like the liberation of the kidnapped
Westerners and of Iranian agents involved in previous terrorist activities
in Europe) were solved during his early presidency.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, Iran abstained from any provocative steps during
the months of preparation and the outcome of the Gulf War, while waiting
for the results of a campaign which would obviously influence Iraq’s strategic
status in the region and vis-a-vis Iran.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Not only the complete Iraqi defeat in the war, but also
the deep strategic changes implied by the disintegration of the Soviet
Union, the other “infidel” superpower, and the whole communist system,
plus the birth of new Muslim republics on its Northern border, strengthened
Iran’s position as a regional power.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Iran could now feel confident of its new strategic strength
and ready to continue the elimination of any opposition abroad. And <I>tant
pis</I> if the activists lived mainly in Western countries and the assassinations
could endanger the relations with their governments, well known for their
weakness in face of the Iranian resolve!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But another important consequence of the second Gulf War,
which Iran could not ignore, was the emergence of the United States as
the only superpower, and its determination to lay the foundations of a
New World Order based on democratic and liberal values, an anathema to
the revolutionary regime in Tehran.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One of the first U.S. moves for the implementation of
the new order was the sponsorship of the political negotiated process in
the Middle East between Israel, its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians,
inaugurated at the Madrid Conference in October 1991. Iran immediately
perceived the threat to its ideological and strategic interests: the recognition
of Israel’s legitimacy as a state in the Middle East and the consequent
strategic, political and economic advantages to the Jewish state; the consolidation
of the moderate Arab regimes and at the same time the threat to the radical
Islamic movements, such as the Hizballah, if Syria joined the process in
earnest; the isolation of Iran on the regional level and its defeat on
the ideological ground.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Iran immediately convened a conference in Tehran reuniting
all the terrorist and radical organizations hostile to any negotiation
with Israel and ready to continue the struggle against it in a common Islamic
front, under Iranian leadership. At the closing of the Tehran conference,
the regime took the decision to support the “Palestinian Resistance” on
the humanitarian, financial, political and military level and established
a special committee under the chairmanship of the vice-president in order
to implement the decision. The struggle in support of Palestine has thus
become one of the few issues were there is overlapping between Iran’s ideological-revolutionary
and national-pragmatic interests.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The materialization of this support included the stepping-up
of weapons supplies to Hizballah, through Syria or by direct flights to
Beirut; financial support and training of Hamas and PIJ terrorist militants
in camps in Iran itself or more often in the Hizballah or Revolutionary
Guard’s camps in the Beka’a valley in Lebanon. Moreover, Iran helped or
directed acts of terror against Israeli targets, although Iranian propaganda
linked the attacks of March 1992 to the Israeli military activity against
Hizballah and those of March and August 1994 to the massacre of innocent
Muslims in Hebron by an Israeli religious fanatic. As a matter of fact
they fitted into the overall Iranian and Islamic strategy to sabotage the
political process. The fact is that the Bangkok operation, for instance,
was prepared nine months before the massacre in Hebron and it was probably
a joint venture between Hizballah and Iran.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The culmination of this Iranian subversive activity occurred
during the months of February-March 1996, while the terrorist suicide attacks
perpetrated by Hamas and the PIJ practically stopped the political process
and also brought about the fall of the Peres government. At about the same
period appeared the first evidence of direct Iranian involvement in the
training and preparation of Palestinian terrorists to be sent in Israel
by the Islamic organizations.[<A HREF="#8">8</A>]&nbsp; Hizballah also
adopted this modus operandi, by mounting what is thought to be its first
terrorist penetration operation through Israel's international borders.[<A HREF="#9">9</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The question arises then what provoked the sudden Iranian
inactivity in the terrorist field in 1995 and its subsequent upsurge in
1996. The answer to this question is very likely related to the policy
of the leading European countries and the United States towards Iran.</FONT>

<P><B>The American and European reaction to Iranian terrorism </B>[<A HREF="#10">10</A>]
<BR><FONT SIZE=+0>At the G-7 summit meeting of the most industrialized
nations, in Munich in July 1992, the United States proposed a strong condemnation
of the Iranian policy concerning the quest for nuclear weapons, its support
to international terrorism and the abuse of human rights in Iran. The censure
was cancelled due to the European's, and especially Germany's, opposition.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At their summit meeting in Edinburgh in December 1992
the European Union countries chose instead to open a “critical dialogue”
with Iran in the belief that quiet diplomatic pressures accompanied by
generous economic advantages would convince the Iranian regime to soften
its stand on the main conflicting issues, and at the same time would strengthen
Rafsanjani's position in his internal struggle against the “radicals,”
who, it was assumed, forced upon him an aggressive foreign policy. France
and Germany led and pushed forward the camp of those countries in the EU
who believed in the success of this strategy.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In May 1993 the American administration decided on a Dual
Containment Policy (DCP), designed to neutralize the threat of Iraq under
Saddam Hussein and to induce the Iranian regime to change its behavior
in those aspects of its policy considered unacceptable (the quest for non-conventional
weapons, its support to terrorism and the abuse of human rights). During
spring 1995, under strong congressional pressure, the administration announced
a total trade embargo on Iran.[<A HREF="#11">11</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The repeated appeals of the U.S. to its allies to join
the DCP and to put pressure on Iran were not accepted by the European countries
and Japan, who preferred to continue their policy of “constructive dialogue”
rather than resort to punitive measures. Moreover, the Europeans increased
the economic assistance to and their investments in Iran and accepted an
extension of Iran's foreign debt. Implicitly they gave support to the continuation
of Iran's aggressive policy, without the risk of Iran becoming isolated
on the international arena.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The first sign of a possible change in the European countries'
approach appeared at the G-7 summit (plus Russia), held in Halifax in June
1995, which in its final resolution urged Iran for the first time to abandon
and condemn terrorism. In order to counter the threat of terrorism, the
summit leaders commissioned an experts’ group to investigate and report
back to them before the next meeting of the industrial countries in Lyon,
France in 1996.[<A HREF="#12">12</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Europeans seemed prepared to put into practice the
firm stand presented by the Western allies. At the Paris meeting, in the
framework of the “critical dialogue” with Iran held the same month, they
urged the Iranian side to publish a formal statement by president Rafsanjani
renouncing the implementation of the <I>fatwa</I> against Rushdie. They
also raised the subject of Iran's opposition to the Middle East peace process
and asked to end all support to the terrorist organizations assaulting
the process (Hamas, PIJ, and Hizballah).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It should be stressed that during the same year the trial
of the Iranian officials involved in the murder of Shapour Bahtiar was
to begin in France, a French judge actively pursued his investigations
concerning other Iranian terrorist attacks on French soil and the French
police behaved harshly with Iranian diplomats suspected of involvement
in Algerian terrorist activity.[<A HREF="#13">13</A>]&nbsp; In Germany
the media published more and more findings of the legal authorities concerning
the involvement of the Iranian Minister of Intelligence, Ali Fallakhian,
in the Mikonos affair and two Iranian intelligence agents were expelled
in connection with a plan to hit Iranian opposition leaders in Germany.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is only a succinct background of a more complex picture,
but it seems to point to the main reason behind Iran's cautious behavior
and the absence of significant Iranian terrorist activity during these
months of 1995. For the first time the Iranian regime sensed a genuine
resolute European attitude and feared to be isolated and to bear all the
political, economic and internal consequences of the new situation.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But the Iranian apprehensions proved to be short-lived.
The next G-7 summits in Ottawa (December 1995) and Lyon (June 1996) adopted
some measures of cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism, but did
not mention again the Iranian involvement in international terrorism. The
Sharm-el-Sheikh conference (March 1996), summoned after the deadly suicide
attacks carried out by Islamic organizations in Israel, did not allude
to the Iranian part in the devising aglorification of these acts of terror,
because the EU participants and the Arab countries, feared again that such
a resolution would reinforce the “radical elements” in Tehran.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Turkey was probably the “hottest” battleground of the
Iranian terrorist machine. A majority of its acts of terror were perpetrated
on its territory, and its soil served as a base for some of the deadliest
attacks in other European countries (like in the assassination of Bahtiar
in France). The remarkable thing about the Iranian terrorist activity in
Turkey is not only its intensity and the large number and diversity of
targets attacked, but the continuous aggression against Turkish citizens
belonging to the secular intellectual and media elite and the extensive
assistance given to radical Turkish Islamic organizations and groups and
the PKK during the 1990s.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The various Turkish governments riposted very cautiously
in relation to the provocative and subversive Iranian policy, taking in
consideration their major regional strategic and economic interests and
fearing the potential of greater Iranian intervention through its Islamic
proxies and support to the PKK. The advent of an Islamic government in
Turkey for a short period in June 1996 only complicated things and prevented
bolder Turkish initiatives against Iran.[<A HREF="#14">14</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Iranian leadership could therefore imagine that a
more aggressive terrorist policy against Western interests, similar to
that at the beginning of the 1980s, would provide better results. The open
threats against German juridical officials or German citizens and interests
in Iran, acts of terror against Israelis and Jews and even the assassination
of an opposition leader in France, clearly carried this message. The isolation
of the United States in its “dual containment” policy and the renewed interest
of French companies to invest heavily in the Iranian oil-industry may have
convinced the Iranian leaders that the time is ripe to strike at vital
strategic American interests (like its military presence in the Gulf),
taking all the necessary precautions not to link these attacks to Iran.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is instructive to underscore the British conduct during
this period. The U.K. was one of the promoters of the “critical dialogue”
with Iran at the Edinburgh summit in 1992. Britain continued to support
the dialogue, but from a position of great suspicion, firmly demanding
the revocation of the <I>fatwa</I> against Rushdie, while taking all the
necessary and swift measures to prevent any Iranian act of terror. The
fact is that no Iranian terrorist activity was perpetrated on British soil.</FONT>

<P><B>What are the prospects for change?</B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+0>President Khatami's election was the result of considerable
internal discontent and a desire for change in the framework of the Islamic
system, and not the outcome of external pressure. Khatami is part of this
system, although he was shunned because of his “liberal” views - liberal
by Iranian Islamic standards. Khatami's first and main task will be to
improve the economic situation and the welfare of the poor and open the
regime to a more tolerant internal policy.[<A HREF="#15">15</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Khatami probably intends to introduce changes in the Iranian
foreign policy, and his interview on CNN addressing the American people
was sufficiently clever to restate long-standing Iranian positions in a
way that looks very different.<SUP> </SUP>The interview was accompanied
by small d&eacute;tente steps toward U.S. but also raised sharp criticism
from the conservative circles. Thus, Khatami brings the issues of changes
in foreign policy to the forefront of his political priorities and to the
battleground with his opponents.[<A HREF="#16">16</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is clear to all observers that without a deep reshuffle
in the key positions of the Iranian security, military leadership, and
bureaucracy, no real change is possible. The new government reflected,
indeed, some important changes, notably the removal of the Intelligence
Minister, Ali Fallakhian, considered one of the driving forces behind Iran’s
support for terrorism, and the nomination to the Ministry of Interior of
Abdollah Nouri, one of Khatami’s foremost moderate supporters. The changes
in the intelligence and military command and their acceptance by the conservative
Majlis confirmed Khatami’s strength and resolution but did not bring an
end to the confrontation with the conservatives.[<A HREF="#17">17</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>After a short period of hesitation and confusion the conservatives
struck back. The Spiritual Leader Khamane’I gave a radical address to the
Tehran Organization of the Islamic Conference (December 1997). Khamene’i’
maliciously attacked the moderate and respected Ayatollah Montazeri concerning
the issue of <I>marja-i taqlid,.</I> And finally, Tehran’s successful mayor,
one of Khatami’s important moderate supporters was arbitrarily detained
(he was liberated after ten days of political pressure and student demonstrations).[<A HREF="#18">18</A>]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the terrorism front itself the signs also seem conflicting.
Khatami declared that Iran continues to oppose the peace process in the
Middle East and depicted Israel as a racist, expansionist and terrorist
state. According to Israeli sources, the flow of weapons to Hizballah is
continuing and Iran is still providing the Palestinian terrorist groups
with funds and military training. Recently, representatives of terror groups
met in Tehran to coordinate their activities with Iran.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the other hand, according to an article published in
The New York Times on March 22, 1998, Khatami recently sent US President
Bill Clinton a message vowing that Iran would no longer support Islamic
terrorist groups that oppose the Middle East peace process and would respect
any Palestinian decision concerning a peace agreement with Israel.[<A HREF="#19">19</A>]&nbsp;
Moreover, Atallah Mohagerani, Iranian Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister
stated that if Israel withdraws from Lebanon under provisions of secure
and final borders there would be no further need for the military activities
of Hizballah.[<A HREF="#20">20</A>]</FONT>

<P><B>Conclusion</B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+0>Contrary</FONT><B> </B><FONT SIZE=+0>to the Palestinian
and Arab international terrorism of the 1970s and 1980s, which stemmed
mostly from strategic constraints and operational necessities, the Iranian
terrorism has a strong ideological basis and receives its legitimacy from
the revolutionary Islamic dogma itself. Terror is seen as a legitimate
tool in internal politics and for the conduct of foreign policy. Terrorism
is no longer the business of outlawed terrorist organizations or of aggressive
intelligence services, but the outcome of policies formulated and decided
upon at the highest religious and governmental echelons.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The fact that the Iranian religious ideology and its methods
were accepted and emulated by many radical Islamic organizations--in the
Middle East, in North Africa, and practically wherever there are active
Islamic communities - has raised the fear of a war of cultures with the
rest of the non-Islamic world--mainly a war against the Western culture
and values.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The conservative elements inside Iran will certainly attempt
to maintain this ideologically aggressive foreign policy. It is likely
that their recent steps in the confrontation with President Khatami and
his moderate supporters are only the beginning of a long struggle about
the nature of the regime. In this struggle any thing goes - including the
weapon of terrorism - in order to sabotage Khatami's attempts to open the
regime internally and moderate its foreign policy.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Therefore, what is at stake in the following months and
years in the internal factional struggle in Iran is not only the kind of
regime the country will get but also, perhaps, the fate of the strategic
and cultural conflict with the West. In light of the past experiences and
lessons, it seems that only a firm and resolute stand on the part of the
Western powers, allied and cooperating on all levels, will help the new
Iranian administration to win the battle.</FONT>

<A NAME="1"></A>In April 1988, Ayatollah Khamene’i declared at the Tehran
Friday prayer that ‘exporting the revolution is like glitter of the sun
of which rays...brighten the entire world”. See Etalla’at, 9 Apr. 1988,
as cited by Haggay Ram, “Exporting Iran’s Islamic Revolution: Steering
a Path between Pan-Islam and Nationalism”, in Terrorism and Political Violence,

East” edited by Bruce Maddy-Weitzman and Efraim Inbar , (pp. 7-24), p.

<A NAME="4"></A>Most of the statistical data&nbsp; concerning the terrorist
attacks on opposition activists is based on the “Appendix to Action Memorandum
011: Alleged victims of Iranian government ‘hit squads’, 1979-1996”, Foundation
for Democracy, 6 May 1966 (see their&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.iran.org">website</A>)
and the “List of Victims of the Mullahs' Regime Terrorist Activity Abroad”
published by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (see their website&nbsp;
http://www.iran-e-azad.org/english/terrorlist.html}. If someone had doubts
about the veracity of those publications, the last trials in France and
Germany have proved that the Iranian opposition was right in its pointing
the finger towards the Iranian government.</LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="5"></A>In January 1997 Iranian agents tried to attack again the
Baghdad headquarters of the MEK using a “supermortar” of a design similar
to that discovered aboard the Iranian ship “Kolahdooz” by Belgian customs
authorities in early 1996. The attack was&nbsp; unsuccessful, resulting
in the death of one person and some damage to an Iraqi hospital building.

<LI>
<A NAME="7"></A>At the beginning of May 1998 Iran's cultural attache to
Buenos Aires has been linked again to the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish
Community Center. The Argentinean public prosecutor said that the Iranian
cultural attache had been under suspicion for some time in connection with
the blast and has been debarred from returning to Argentina since March.
The Argentine judge heading the investigation has&nbsp; recently debriefed
in Germany an unidentified witness who claimed that the Iranian attache
carried out the “intelligence groundwork” for the attack. See Reuters,
5 May 1998.</LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="8"></A>The arrested terrorists in Israel, Khalil ’Aita (PIJ -
Shqaqi Faction) and Hassan Salameh (Hamas), provided evidence of Iranian
involvment in the supply of logistic and financial assisstance&nbsp; and
training to their organizations.</LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="9"></A>Muhammad Hussein Mikdad, a Lebanese Shi'i, and accountant
for Hizballah's social welfare services in Lebanon, was chosen by the organization’s
apparatus for&nbsp; overseas security to become a maverick terrorist. In
April 1996 he arrived by plane from Zurich to Tel Aviv with bomb parts
hidden in a carry-on bag and entered Israel&nbsp; on a forged British.
On April 9, Mikdad checked into a hotel in East Jerusalem, where he was
to assemble a bomb intended to explode in a public place in Israel. On
April 12, Mikdad was badly wounded when the bomb he was assembling in the
hotel room accidentally detonated. Mikdad was trained for the preparation
of the bomb at the Iranian embassy in Beirut. See the <A HREF="mikdad1.htm">information</A>

<A NAME="20"></A>Mohagerani, who is also Iran’s government spokesman, made
the declaration in a press conference on 28th March at the Iranian Embassy
in Paris. He said that Hizballah would continue to exist as a political
party, and would focus instead on political and cultural activity within
the framework of internal Lebanese politics. But, of course, it would give
up its military apparatus and activities. On this interesting issue and
Iran’s relations with Hizballah, see the article by <A HREF="articledet.cfm?articleid=20">Reuven
