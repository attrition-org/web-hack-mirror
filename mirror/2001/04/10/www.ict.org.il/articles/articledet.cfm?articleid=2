<p><A NAME="Part of the Moslem Brotherhood"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Part of the
Moslem Brotherhood</FONT>

<P>The Hamas movement is an offshoot of the Moslem Brotherhood in the Israeli-administered
territories, or as defined in the second and fifth articles of the Hamas
Charter: "Hamas - the Islamic Resistance Movement - is a division of the
Moslem Brotherhood in Palestine. The Moslem Brotherhood is international
and the largest of the Islamic movements in the modern era...The Islamic
Resistance Movement is a specifically Palestinian movement. Its loyalty
is to Allah and its commitment is to Islam as a way of life".

<P>The Moslem Brotherhood in the territories was formed during the years
1967-1977, when the Islamic-religious forces joined ranks, under the aegis
of similar groups in Arab countries (mainly Jordan and Egypt), to form
a single movement. In 1978 the movement, led by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, registered
as a non-profit organization called the Moujama. From its founding until
the mid-1980s, the Moslem Brotherhood concentrated its activities in Judea,
Samaria and Gaza upon recruitment and dissemination of Islamic values among
Palestinians in general and among the youth in particular. To achieve these
goals, the movement strove to gain control of centers of influence and
education, primarily mosques, universities and schools.

<P>The Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba (October 1988) described Moslem Brotherhood
activities during this period: "During the years 1967-1975 the role of
the Islamic movement was characterized by the building of mosques, bringing
the [younger] generation into the fold, providing them with guidance and
strengthening their ideology. To this end, the movement utilized all means
at its disposal. The mosque, therefore, did not serve solely as a place
of worship, but also as school, kindergarten, or even library or venue
for women’s activities. Ideology and religion were preached at clubs, schools
and universities, where mosques were often built and politics discussed.
In this fashion the [younger] generation opened its eyes and discovered
the Jewish plots against the nation."

<P>Following the assassination of Egyptian President Sadat, many Palestinians,
members of the Moslem Brotherhood studying at Egypt’s Islamic universities,
were deported. These students, who strengthened the foundations of the
Moslem Brotherhood in the territories (particularly in Gaza), soon integrated
into the educational system and the universities in the territories, recruiting
others to the movement’s religious-fundamentalist ideology.

<P><A NAME="Born with the Intifada"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Born with the Intifada</FONT>

<P>On the eve of the intifada, the Moslem Brotherhood twice used the name
"Hamas" for its operations. On the first occasion, a leaflet was distributed
in the Gaza Strip (March 1987) decrying the use and sale of drugs and was
directed at pharmacists and drug dealers who "currupt youth." The second
leaflet signed by Hamas, included detailed instructions on how to beware
of Israeli intelligence in the territories. The Hamas movement, however,
was actually founded only after the outbreak of the intifada. Activists
of the Moslem Brotherhood, who had until then concentrated primarily on
religious and educational operations and had refrained from openly anti-Israel
activities (for fear of IDF reprisal and possible restrictions upon the
movement), came under sharp criticism from among the Palestinians.

<P>The founding of Hamas - the Islamic Resistance Movement - at the beginning
of the intifada can be linked to a number of factors:

<P>A) In the mid-1980s, a group of Moslem Brotherhood activists broke away
to form the Islamic Jihad. This organization, which rejected passivity,
added a national-Palestinian aspect to its Moslem fundamentalist ideology.
"Jihad" activists, who advocated attacks against Israel and who carried
them out as well, won great sympathy in the territories, and especially
in Gaza. On the eve of the intifada, the Islamic Jihad enjoyed even greater
popularity following a number of "successful" attacks carried out by its
operatives in Gaza and Jerusalem, and following the brazen escape of some
of the movement’s senior activists from an Israeli jail (May 1987).

<P>B) The many demonstrations and protest activities that took place during
the first stage of the intifada swept the Palestinian masses, including
Moslem Brotherhood activists, into the streets. The movement’s leaders
began to fear that continuing to prohibit the participation of their members
in overt anti-Israel activity, would rob them of the widespread support
they had won, during their supporters into the arms of other organizations.

<P>C) The leadership of the Moslem Brotherhood soon understood that the
"Palestinian struggle" had entered a new phase as a result of the intifada,
and that whoever succeeded in controlling events in the territories would
stand a better chance in the inter-organizational struggle.

<P>D) The Moslem Brotherhood leadership estimated that after many years
of semi-covert recruitment and education, their movement had succeeded
in winning sufficient popular support to make it difficult for Israeli
forces to eradicate it, even if it were to allow its members to participate
in anti-Israeli activities.

<P><A NAME="Hamas Turns to Violence"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas Turns to Violence</FONT>

<P>As a result, in early 1988 Hamas began operating as the military arm
of the Moslem Brotherhood in the territories. Hamas activities were directed
against both Israelis, military and civilian, and local Palestinians -
"collaborators" or those "acting contrary to Islamic values." Initially,
the movement’s operations were concentrated mainly in Gaza, but later spread
to Judea and Samaria as well. Hamas established a network for control and
direction of protest activities, distributed independent leaflets announcing
protest and strike dates different from those announced by the Unified
National Command (PLO), organized widespread demonstrations and disturbances
in the territories, and acted against those who "currupt morals" (those
involved with prostitution, drugs and alchohol).

<P>A few months after the outbreak of the intifada, Hamas was already playing
a central role in the various protest and terrorist activities in the territories,
while movement activists began to carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli
civilian and military targets.

<P><A NAME="Hamas Terrorist Activities"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas Terrorist
Activities</FONT>

<P>Hamas is one of the most extreme organizations in its attitude toward
Israel. Leaflet #65 (October 1990) called upon local residents to murder
Jews and burn their property. "Every Jew or settler is a target and must
be killed. Their blood and their property are forfeit".

<P>In carrying out their religious duty to fight against Israel, Hamas
adherents have been responsible for such attacks as the brutal murder of
three workers at an aluminium plant in Jaffa in December 1990; the infiltration
of a six-man terrorist squad from Jordan in March 1991 that wounded three
IDF soldiers before they were caught in the vicinity of Kibbutz Tirat Zvi,
and whose members carried Korans and photographs of Sheikh Yassin in addition
to weapons; the murder of Shlomo Yehiya from Moshav Kadima in September
1991; and the attack at Tel Hashomer junction in October 1991 in which
two soldiers were killed and eleven others wounded.

<P>The kidnapping and murder of Israeli soldiers Avi Sasportas and Ilan
Saadon in 1989, were among the most serious carried out by Hamas. The attacks
were carried out in similar fashion: Mahmoud Nasser (who had been released
in the Jibril prisoner exchange) and Mahmoud Mabhouh, stole an Israeli
Subaru automobile, donned skullcaps and gave the hitchiking soldiers rides.
During the drive, the terrorists shot the soldiers with a .22 caliber pistol
and then buried them.

<P>Following the murders, the two hid out in a house in the Daraj section
of Gaza where they received assistance and food from local Hamas activists.
After about a month, they were smuggled out to Egypt, from where they were
taken to Libya. When Israeli security forces were close to discovering
their hideout, senior Hamas commanders recommended that the two commit
suicide and become matyrs.

<P>Hamas did not, however, concentrate only upon the murder of Israelis,
and the movement’s operatives were also involved in many murders of Palestinians
in the territories as well.

<P><A NAME="A Synthesis of Religion and Nationalism"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>A
Synthesis of Religion and Nationalism</FONT>

<P>The ideology of Hamas is a synthesis of pan-Arab Islamic religious ideals
and Palestinian nationalism. The movement emphasizes that the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is in reality a religious struggle between Islam and Judaism.
It is along these lines that Article 15 of the Hamas Charter (August 1988)
states: "There is no escaping [the need] to make it clear to generations
of Moslems, that the Palestine problem is a religious one, and must be
treated as such." This view was reinforced in a booklet distributed by
Hamas in early 1990 which stated: "Our struggle with the Jews is a struggle
between truth and emptiness - between Islam and Judaism." Hamas leaflet
#70 (February 1991) called upon the PLO to "revoke the Algiers resolutions
and declare the Islamic [nature] of the Palestinian problem."

<P>Despite its emphasis upon the Islamic pan-Arab ideal, Hamas simultaneously
stresses that it is an authentic Palestinian movement with the primary
goal of solving the "Palestinian problem." In Article 12 of its charter,
Hamas attempts to reconcile the contradiction between its pan-Islamic character
and its specifically Palestinian national aspirations: "From the point
of view of the Islamic Resistance Movement, nationalism is a part of religious
belief. There is no greater nationalism than that inherent in a situation
in which the enemy takes possession of Moslem land. In such a situation,
every Moslem man and woman is obligated to participate in the Jihad."

<P><A NAME="No Territorial Compromise"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>No Territorial
Compromise</FONT>

<P>As a result of its Islamic religious viewpoint, Hamas believes that
"that the soil of Palestine is sacred" and that every Moslem must take
action to liberate "all of Palestine" from the Jews. The objection of Hamas
to any territorial compromise with Israel, is expressed in Article 1 of
its Charter: "The Islamic Resistance Movement believes Palestine to be
the Islamic wakf [sacred property of all Moslems until the end of days&yacute;&yacute;&yacute;&yacute;].
Neither Palestine, nor any part of it, can be conceded."; in Article 13:
"Any concession of a part of Palestine is a concession of a part of the
faith"; and in Article 6: [The movement] is striving to fly the flag of
Allah over every part of Palestine."

<P>The movement’s rejection of compromise with Israel is also evident in
the leaflets which it distributes in the territories. In leaflet #34 (January
1989) Hamas attacked the "traitorous views" of Palestinians who support
concession of any part of Palestine. The leaflet provides the following
explanation for its rejection of territorial compromise: "How can we allow
the Jews to establish a state of oppression and terrorism on four-fifths
of [our] holy land?" In leaflet #68 (December 1990), the movement declared
it would "continue the part of Jihad until all of our blessed land is liberated
from the river to the sea."

<P>A slightly more moderate interpretation of Hamas’ position regarding
territorial compromise, appeared in the Jordanian daily Sawt A-Shab (18
January 1990). According to this article, Hamas could agree to territorial
concessions to Israel, providing it were understood that this compromise
would only be temporary, and on condition that the compromise would not
obligate the Palestinians to recognize Israel’s right to exist in any part
of Palestine. The article states: "Hamas believes that liberation of all
of Palestine from the river to the sea, is the highest possible strategic
goal. The movement believes, however, that this does not preclude liberating
parts of Palestine by force or any other method, as long as this solution
does not include recognition of the legality of the Zionist presence in
Palestine, and as long as this solution does not revoke the right of the
Palestinian people and of the Arab and Islamic nations, to liberate all
of the Palestinian homeland and destroy the foreign Zionist entity."

<P><A NAME="No Negotiations with Israel"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>No Negotiations
with Israel</FONT>

<P>The hard-line stance taken by Hamas regarding territorial compromise
also accounts for the movement’s opposition to any negotiation with Israel
whatsoever, for fear that a peace process might entail a demand for Palestinian
concessions as well. The movement’s Charter states in Article 13:"Initiatives
and so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences for the
resolution of the Palestinian problem, are contrary to the views of the
Islamic Resistance Movement... These conferences are nothing but another
method by which the infidels take possession of Moslem land. When did the
infidels ever deal justly with sons of the faith?... The only solution
to the Palestinian problem is Jihad. All of the initiatives, proposals
and international conferences are a waste of time."

<P>In Article 32 of the Charter, the movement expresses its opposition
to any bilateral agreement between Israel and the Arab states: "World Zionism
and the imperialist forces are cleverly trying through careful planning
to remove the Arab states, one by one, from the arena in order to isolate
the Palestinian people.... The Islamic Resistance Movement calls upon Arab
and Moslem peoples to act seriously and continuously to thwart this fearful
plan, and to awaken public awareness to the danger involved in withdrawal
from the field of conflict with Zionism."

<P>In Hamas leaflets distributed over the past few years in the territories,
the movement has expressed its opposition to every possible peace plan
that has arisen. In leaflet #46 (September 1989) the movement rejected
Egypt’s ten-point peace plan and warned Palestinians against contact with
the United States. In leaflet #55 (March 1990) the movement attacked Palestinian
figures who had met with former U.S. President Carter, and declared that
these were trying to revive Camp David accords and that they do not represent
the Palestinian people.

<P>Predictably, Hamas also opposes the current peace talks between Israel
and the Palestinians and other Arabs. The talks that began in Madrid and
have continued in Washington, have aroused the anger of Hamas, whose activists
have vowed to do everything in their power to undercut them and have branded
the Palestinian delegates as traitors.

<P><A NAME="The Imperative of Holy War"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>The Imperative
of Holy War</FONT>

<P>In the absence of any willingness to accept territorial compromise,
and in the light of the movement’s adamant refusal to conduct negotiations
with Israel, the only path left open to Hamas for the resolution of the
Palestinian problem, is that of violent struggle to the death - the way
of Jihad.

<P>Since its founding, Hamas has emphasized the imperative upon Moslems
everywhere to take part in the Jihad for the liberation of Palestine, as
expressed in Article 14 of the charter: "It (the liberation of Palestine)
is the personal obligation of all Moslems everywhere. The problem must
be viewed on this basis, and every Moslem must understand this;" and in
Article 15: "The day upon which the enemy steals a part of the Moslem lands,
Jihad becomes the personal obligation of every Moslem. In light of the
Jewish theft in Palestine, there is no alternative but to raise the flag
of Jihad."

<P>The movement, however, defines Jihad in a broader sense. Jihad, according
to the charter, "is not limited to bearing arms. The struggle against the
enemy, with an appropriate word, a good article, or a helpful book; through
support and assistance, when done in the name of victory for the flag of
Allah - are all Jihad for the sake of God."

<P>In an interview with Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in Yediot Ahronot
(September 1988), there appeared, nevertheless, to be a remote chance that
the movement might agree to negotiations with Israel. Yassin declared:
"As long as we ourselves have not liberated any part of Palestine, there
is no point in beginning these proceedings. Their time has not yet come.
The PLO must exercise patience and not recognize Israel, since Israel has
taken everything from the Palestinian people and given nothing in return.
Israel must first restore the rights of the Palestinian people. Only then
will it be possible to talk."

<P>In an interview with Israel Television’s Arabic service (while imprisoned
in September 1989), Yassin explained that he would agree to peace talks
with Israel providing that both the terms of the peace plan and the final
objectives of negotiations were clear. A short time later (December 1989),
the movement’s representatives in the territories demanded that the PLO
allot five places to Hamas on the delegation then taking shape for negotiations
with Israel. It should be noted that the hierarchical structure of Hamas
(the leader of the movement is not only its central political figure, but
also the highest religious authority) grants its leadership room to maneuver
regarding negotiations with Israel. Thus, if at some point, the movement’s
leaders feel it is in its interest to do so, they might find religious
sanction for its participation in a peace process in the region.

<P>Hamas is opposed to the idea of autonomy in the territories since, according
to Sheikh Yassin, "the actual meaning of autonomy is that the Jews will
have everything and the Palestinians nothing." The final goal to which
the movement aspires, is the liberation of all of Palestine and the establishment
of an Islamic state from the river to the sea.

<P>In this regard, Hamas also opposes an independent Palestinian state.
In an interview in Haaretz, Gaza Hamas leader Mahmud Azhar state: "The
Palestinians were always part of a pan-Islamic state.... In Europe they
are now establishing an economic union and soon they will also establish
a political union. This is the direction in which the world is going today.
We Arabs have one culture and one language. The borders of the different
states in the Arab world are not our borders, but rather borders set by
France and Britain. The border with Egypt is not our border and the border
between Iraq and Syria is not our border. Nasser wanted to establish a
pan-Arab state in his way, the secular way, and failed. Now we want to
try this idea our way".

<P>In the ideal Islamic state, according to Hamas, peace and tranquility
will reign, as stated in Article 6 of the charter: "Alongside Islam, adherents
to all religions will be able to live in peace and safety to themselves,
their property and their rights."

<P>It appears, however, from other articles in the charter and the movement’s
various publications, that the attitude of Hamas toward Jews in general
and Israelis in particular, is not as humane as the movement would have
it seem. In leaflet #34 (January 1989) the movement called upon residents
of the territories to "destroy the Jews and take revenge on them". Article
7 of the Charter quotes from the Koran: "The hour will not come until the
Moslems fight the Jews and kill them, so much so that when a Jew will hide
behind a tree or a stone, these will say: "Moslem, servant of God, there
is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him."

<P>The Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba (October 1988) offered an explanation of the
movement’s attitude toward the Jews: "Allah gathered the Jews to Palestine
not so that it should serve them as a homeland, but rather so that Palestine
should serve them as a cemetery. Allah will rid the entire world of the
Jewish affliction, and just as pilgrims atone for their sins by offering
a sacrifice at Mecca, so the Jews will be offered as a sacrifice at Al-Aqsa
by hands as pure as those of the pilgrims."

<P><A NAME="Structure of the Movement"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Structure of the
Movement</FONT>

<P>Following the outbreak of the intifada, the leaders of the Moslem Brotherhood
decided that the time had come to found a military arm, which would take
part in resistance and protest activities in the territories, in terrorist
attacks against Israel, and in the Palestinian inter-organizational struggle
for control in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Some of the central sections
of Hamas (such as the military and security sections) were, therefore,
built upon the existing Moslem Brotherhood structures established during
the 1980s.

<P>Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, aged 47, and the father of 11, is still considered
the leader of Hamas. He is confined to a wheelchair, the result of a fall
on the beach in his teens (there are those who claim he was injured in
an explosion). Despite his disability, he studied at Ein Shams University
in Cairo and returned to Gaza as a teacher. In November 1989, Yassin was
charged with having devised the goals of the organizations he had founded,
directing their activities, passing on extensive financial assistance to
them, receiving reports on their activities, ordering the murder of three
collaborators and planning further murders. In October 1991, he was convicted
and sentenced to life imprisonment plus 15 years.

<P>Following the arrest of Sheikh Yassin, Dr. Ibrahim Yazouri was appointed
Head of the Moslem Brotherhood. Arrested in 1990, Yazouri was found guilty
of serious security offenses and of having been responsible for the deaths
of the two Israeli soldiers.

<P>In its founding stage during the early months of the intifada (1987-1988),
the movement concentrated upon building its sections and activating its
members. The institutionalizing stage came in 1989, during which the movement
worked on strengthening its infrastructure while establishing low-level
ranks of command on the regional level. The reorganizing stage began following
the first wave of arrests of the senior and mid-level leadership of Hamas
in late 1989. Israel’s determined action against the Islamic Resistance
Movement and its leaders, was a severe blow to the movement and forced
it to restaff most of the senior positions in its various divisions. The
movement was also forced to move its leadership to Jordan, to build its
control facilities there, and to establish its apparatus there along lines
similar to those in the territories.

<P>The military section of Hamas (called Mujahedim A-Falestinin) was founded
in 1982 as an independent body affiliated with the Moslem Brotherhood.
This section concentrates on planning and carrying out attacks against
Israeli military and civilian targets both in the territories and within
the "Green Line." The leaders of the military section order operatives
to carry out terrorist attacks, provide them with material, and brief them
prior to carrying out operations. The section operates under great secrecy,
employs various methods of hiding and relaying arms and information among
the movement’s activists, and trains operatives in various methods of fighting,
often including the use of live weapons and the preparation of explosives.
Until the end of 1989, the military arm was headed by Sheikh /Salah Shahadeh,
and since his arrest is apparently operated from Jordan and perhaps even
(through messengers) from Israeli jails.

<P>The Hamas security section, Al-Majd (Glory), was founded in 1987 (before
the intifada) within the Moslem Brotherhood in the territories. The aim
of this section, as defined by the movement’s leaders at the time, was
to fight "corruption" in the territories and to monitor Palestinians suspected
of collaboration with Israel. These tasks gained added significance with
the establishment of Hamas, and operatives of this division began to interrogate,
judge and carry out sentences issued by makeshift courts against Palestinians
suspected of transgressing against the precepts of Islam (such as drug
trafficking and sexual misconduct), or of collaboration with Israeli security
forces. In this fashion, operatives of the section brutally tortured and
murdered dozens of Palestinian "collaborators" during the years 1987-1991.

<P>Another task entrusted to the security section was the gathering of
information on the activities of other Palestinian organizations in the
territories, including surveillance of their operatives, gathering of leaflets
distributed by them, and even planting Hamas agents in their ranks. Among
the material discovered in the Hamas archive seized by Israeli security
forces in 1989, were surveillance reports on activists in other organizations,
as well as documents instructing Hamas operatives on how to infiltrate
other organizations and plant agents.

<P>As opposed to other Palestine organizations in the territories, Hamas
found no need to operate a special section for the dissemination of its
ideology among the residents of the territories. Hamas, established by
the Moslem Brotherhood, simply employed the dozens of mosques and Islamic
associations already existing in the West Bank and Gaza to this end. The
movement’s information section was, therefore, charged with the dissemination
of its decisions and instructions regarding strikes, demonstrations, etc.,
among the entire population of the territories and not specifically among
Hamas activists. Operatives of the Hamas information section are responsible
for writing the movement’s leaflets and distributing them throughout the
territories, for which purpose they use a vast network of messengers and
a modern system of facsimile machines (some of which were seized by Israeli
security forces in 1991).

<P>The information section is also apparently responsible for the publication
of the movement’s various periodicals in Arab countries and Europe (i.e.,
Falestine al-Muslimah,&yacute;&yacute; published in the U.K.). The section
apparently maintains strong ties with pro-Hamas newspapers published within
the "Green Line" by Moslem activists in Israel, as well.

<P>The "uprising" section of Hamas is responsible for organizing and implementing
protests and demonstrations in the territories. Section members write anti-Israel
slogans on the walls of buildings, prevent Palestinians from going to work
in Israel, and initiate local clashes with the IDF including stone-throwing
and roadblocks. This section is also in charge of distributing leaflets
on the street, organizing strikes and enforcing them, and distributing
funds to needy families.

<P>At the head of Hamas and subordinate to the movement’s leader, Sheikh
Yassin, stands the Steering Committee, which includes Sheikh Mohammed Abu
Zid, Sheikh Bassam Jarar, Sheikh Jamal Hamami and others and serves as
the movement’s senior ideological and religious authority.

<P>Following the arrest of Sheikh Yassin along with a number of the members
of the Steering Committee, new activists were appointed to leadership positions,
and the involvement of Jordan-based Moslem Brotherhood leaders in Hamas
activities in the territories increased.

<P>Lower down in the Hamas hierarchy is the Central Committee, in charge
of planning and coordination of the movement’s operation in the West Bank
and Gaza, and compromising four members: three from the West Bank and East
Jerusalem, and one from the Gaza Strip. Hamas operations sectors include
the Northern Sector (the Nablus Sector - coordinating activities in Jenin,
Nablus and Tulkarem), Jerusalem, Hebron and the Gaza Strip. Part of the
regional command structure was unearthed by Israeli security forces in
February 1991 and the regional leaders, who had been operating under the
guise of press offices, were arrested.

<P>Hamas receives funds from three main sources: a) Donations and dues
from members and supporters in the territories (often the result of coercive
campaigns rather than of a genuine desire to give); b) Special fund-raising
campaigns held in large Arab and Moslem communities in Arab countries (such
as Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states), and Islamic charitable institutions
in the various Arab countries.

<P>Hamas exerts great efforts at fund-raising among the Moslem communities
in the United States. As part of the campaign to strengthen ties between
Hamas and Moslem activists in the U.S., the movement’s Third Congress was
held in late 1990 in Kansas City, with the participation of senior Hamas
activists.

<P>An article critical of Hamas and representing the views of Fatah, which
appeared in the PLO weekly Falestin A-Thawra published in Nicosia, questioned
the sources of the money reaching Hamas and stressed that the receipt of
funds by Palestinian organizations not via the PLO, in fact, harms the
interests of the Palestinian people.

<P><A NAME="Relations with Other Organizations"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Relations
with Other Organizations</FONT>

<P>When Hamas was founded in the late 1980s, many Palestinian organizations
had already been operating in the territories for some time. These organizations
represent a wide range of national and social views and can be divided
into four groups: a) Mainstream (headed by Fatah-Arafat); b)Leftist (including
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, headed by George Habash
and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, headed by Naif
Hawatmeh); c) Pro-Syrian (including the Jibril Front, A’Saiqa, and Fatah-Abu
Mussa); d) Islamic (including the Islamic Jihad and Hamas).

<P>Hamas’ attitude toward the PLO is ambivalent: sympathetic (as a relative
and a partner in common goals and interests), but opposed to the PLO’s
secular outlook and its methods of operation in the international arena.
Despite attempts by mainstream groups to bring Hamas into the fold, the
movement has refused to participate in the joint leadership of the intifada
represented by the Unified National Command. At times, Hamas has maintained
strong ties with PLO activists in the territories - especially on the tactical
level. At others, the political and ideological differences have caused
tension which has even led to street battles between activists of the two
organizations.

<P>In the mid-1980s, as the religious revival in the territories began
to gather momentum, the rise in the popularity of the Moslem Brotherhood
became a matter of concern among the PLO leadership, and the inter-organizational
competition could be feld in the struggle for control of the universities
and Palestinian public opinion. This competition was often accompanied
by violent clashes between the rivals (using stones, clubs and axes), in
some cases leading to killings.

<P>By 1988, Hamas was enjoying incredible success, evident from the many
Palestinians joining its ranks and the response to its leaflets calling
strikes and demonstrations on days other than those called for by the PLO.

<P>During May and June 1991, as the U.S. worked to bring the Palestinians
into a peace process, the rivalry between the two organizations was marked
by violence - using live weapons at times - mainly in Nablus. Such conflicts
were renewed at the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992 against the background
of the decision by the PLO mainstream to participate in the peace talks
with Israel in Madrid and Washington.

<P>The year 1991, saw a number of setbacks in the standing of Hamas in
the territories, which affected its relations with the mainstream in Fatah.
At the outbreak of the Gulf War, support for Hamas in the territories had
reached its peak. "The mother of all wars" stimulated deep religious feelings
among the Palestinians and wall slogans in support of Saddam Hussein and
Hamas appeared on houses throughout the territories. The defeat of Iraq
also affected the Palestinians own sense of security and their belief in
the ability of the Islamic organizations to solve the Palestinian problem
and to destroy Israel by force, which resulted in a decline in the standing
of Hamas in the territories. Yet the rise of the independent Islamic Republics
out of the former USSR at the end of 1991, as well as the success of the
Moslem Brotherhood in Algeria, coupled with frustration at the lack of
success of the mainstrean PLO in the peace talks with Israel, have all
worked to improve the prospects of Hamas in the territories.

<P>The leftist organizations - the Habash Front, the Palestinian Communist
Party, and Naif Hawatmeh’s Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(which during the intifada joined the mainstream group and participated
in the Unified National Command) - are considered totally abhorrent by
Hamas. In September 1988, Sheikh Yassin stated with regard to the communists:
"No, I do not see any possibility of cooperation with them. They are heretics."

<P>The pro-Syrian groups, like most of the terrorist organizations, are
secular in their outlook and, moreover (as opposed to Fatah-Arafat), also
serve as Syrian puppets in the Palestinian arena. On the other hand, however,
after Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin had been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment
for possession of large quantities of arms and for heading a hostile organization
in the mid-1980s, he was released through the intervention of Ahmed Jibril’s
pro-Syrian organization, which demanded Yassin’s release as part of its
prisoner exchange with Israel.

<P>The Islamic Jihad - Hamas’ rival in the Islamic camp in the territories
- was, in fact, the catalyst for the establishment of the Hamas movement.
It was the achievements of the activist Islamic Jihad and the popularity
it enjoyed among Palestinians during the period prior to the outbreak of
the intifada and during its first few months that, inter alia, brought
the leaders of the Moslem Brotherhood to the realization that they must
take an active part in the Palestinian struggle in the territories.

<P>Since the Islamic Jihad and Hamas both derive their support from the
same group - the religious fundamentalists in the territories - the rivalry
between the two movements is great. Stategically, the two organizations
strive for the same goals: the liberation of Palestine through uncompromising
armed struggle, and the establishment of an Islamic religious regime in
the liberated territory. However, while the Islamic Jihad strives for an
Iranian-style Islamic revolution in Palestine with Iranian support, Hamas
is critical of the Islamic Jihad’s ties with Iran.

<P>Hamas also collaborates with Islamic fundamentalists in Israel. The
leader of the Islamic movement in Israel, Sheikh Abdullah Nimr Darwish,
in December 1989 called Hamas "an integral part of the Palestinian people,
struggling for an independent state." Most of this co-operation, however,
is limited to dissemination of the movement’s ideology through newspapers
printed and circulated in Israel (such as Sawt ak-Haq W’al-Hourriah - The
Voice of Justice and Freedom - published in Umm El-Fahm, and closed in
1990 by the Interior Minister for three months for anti-Israel agitation),
and technical assistance in printing the movement’s leaflets in Israel.

<P>Hamas continues to increase in strength in the Israeli-administered
territories and more and more is coming to threaten the exclusive position
of the PLO. The future growth of the movement may depend in a large part
on the outcome of the current peace talks. Lack of progress in the talks
as perceived by the Palestinians, may well work to the advantage of the
Islamic fundamentalists.
