<br><img SRC="../graphics/symbols4.gif" height=143 width=200 align=RIGHT>The
Sunni Islamist terror organizations led by “the Afghan Alumni” have since
the early 1990’s been a dominant factor in the international arena. Yet
their impact on Israel has so far been minimal. In spite of their radical
approach to what they see as the active part played by Israel and the Jews
in the West’s assault on the Muslim world, these Sunni terror organizations
have seldom attacked Israeli and Jewish targets. This is all the more conspicuous
against the background of terrorist activity perpetrated by the Palestinian
and Shi’ite terror organizations that were so prominent in the international
terrorist arena during the 1970s and 1980s.
<p>In recent years, the Saudi millionaire, Osama bin Laden has headed the
“Afghan Alumni” camp, after he founded an “Islamic Front” in order to counter-balance
what he saw as a Jewish-Christian coalition, which he perceived to be a
threat to Islam.
<p>This article will outline the characteristics of the “Afghan Alumni”
phenomenon, their ideology and the scope of their activities against Israeli
and Jewish targets, and will examine whether there is a tendency to expand
their activities into the State of Israel.
<p><b>Who are the “Afghan Alumni”?</b>
<br>The term “Afghan Alumni” relates to thousands of Muslims, particularly
from the Arab world, who hastened to Afghanistan from all over the world,
to fight at the side of the local Mujahideen against the former Soviet
Union (1979–1989). It refers also to “the second generation,” which included
hundreds of volunteers—mostly members of Arab Islamist terror organizations—who
were sent to Afghanistan, after the war, to train in guerilla and terror
warfare. It should be pointed out that although the Afghan Alumni have
been called “the Arab Afghans” and the “Afghans”(1), particularly those
of the “Second Generation,” there are many who were not Arabs at all. These
include the terrorists from Kenya, Tanzania, and the Comoro islands, who
were involved in the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
in August 1998.
<p>The “Afghan Veterans”—those who fought in the war against the Soviet
Union—comprise the backbone of the leadership of many radical terror organizations
active in the Middle East. Their status in their organizations was built
on the myth of their heroism and their success in defeating the “Christian”
Soviet Union in Afghanistan. They saw their victory as the main factor
in the downfall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Their battle experience
and readiness for personal sacrifice gave them the professional and moral
authority to lead their followers in an assault against the “heretic” regimes
in their own countries and against their allies, particularly the U.S.A.
and Israel.
<p>The end of the war in Afghanistan left a large reservoir of violent,
well-trained fighters experienced in guerilla and terror warfare, and motivated
by their radical religious ideology. These fighters searched for a way
to vent their Islamist and revolutionary energy, particularly in the period
after the war. The Afghan Alumni channeled this Islamic passion and battle
experience into various central channels:
<ol>
<li>
Returning to their home countries, they reinforced existing Islamic Jihad
organizations in their countries of origin and considerably intensified
their activities there, thus threatening the stability of their regimes.</li>

<li>
They established new organizational frameworks such as the Al-Qa’idah organization
led by Osama bin Laden.</li>

<li>
They established independent terror cells, with no defined organizational
affinity but with mutual connections with established radical organizations.</li>

<li>
They joined the fighting in areas involving Islamic communities, such as
Bosnia, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Kosovo and Kashmir.(2)</li>
</ol>
The influence of the Afghan Alumni can be seen in the activities of many
terror organizations in the Muslim world, particularly in the Egyptian
organizations Al- Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah and the Egyptian Jihad. They have
also had an impact on the Algerian GIA., the Kashmiri Harakat-ul-Ansar,
the Philippine “Abu Sayyaf,” and autonomous radical terrorist cells, not
to mention Al-Qa`idah.
<p><b>The ideology of the Afghan Alumni</b>
<br>The worldview of the Afghan Alumni has been shaped by living and fighting
in Afghanistan alongside the local Mujahideen. The process of absorbing
the volunteers in Pakistan and Afghanistan was accompanied by intensive
religious courses and indoctrination. Their long stay in a extremely homogenous
religious society—a society fighting a war of Jihad against a “Christian”
enemy—greatly influenced their thought and activity.
<p>A central element in their worldview was that their Jihad was a war
of self-defense against the cultural assault of the West, led by the Americans
and the Jews, who were seen as “running it and dictating its policy.” Bin
Laden, one of the central adherents of this worldview, cited in his militant
statements “the religious-cultural-historical struggle of Islam with the
“Judeo-Crusader” conspiratorial alliance, which aims at defeating Islam
and conquering its sacred lands.”(3) His views are amply illustrated in
interviews given to the press, as well as in his publications, such as
the “Declaration of war” in June 1996 (4) and his religious ruling (<i>Fatwah</i>)
of February 1998 (5). In his eyes, Islam is besieged on all sides by foreign
secular forces and by Western modernization.(6) In his mind, the whole
world in general, and the Middle East in particular, is an arena of a determinist
battle for survival between the three monotheistic religions. The enemy
in this battle is seen as the Christian-Jewish coalition of the US, Israel
and World Jewry. This enemy has occupied the most sacred lands of Islam,
in Mecca, Medinah, and Jerusalem, and seeks to defeat Islam and the Muslims.
According to bin Laden this unholy alliance is carrying out a systematic
and deliberate massacre of Muslims. His example is the massacre of the
Muslim Iraqi population by American forces in the Gulf War in 1991 and
their bombings in Iraq in December 1998, as well as the massacre in the
Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Christian Phalangists
allied with Israel and the killing of Palestinians by Israel.(7)
<p>In order to recruit and motivate Muslim believers, bin Laden has need
of historical terms with Islamic connotations, such as Crusaders and Jihad.
He explains the need for violent activity in terms of the defense of Islamic
sacred elements, and presents the Muslims as victims. His use of terrorism
and violence is meant to prove to his adherents that the so-called undefeatable
enemies of Islam, such as the US, the Soviet Union, and Israel, were vulnerable
due to the weakness of their faith. Terrorism is part of a struggle whose
goals are twofold: the “purification” of the sacred places in Mecca and
Medinah currently “under American occupation,” and the moral and psychological
victory of the Muslim warriors. Bin Laden has foreseen a similar fate to
the occupation of al-Aqsa and Jerusalem by Israel.(8)
<p>At the beginning of 1998, Bin Laden gathered around him an Islamist
coalition to assist him in consolidating a front against the Judeo-Crusader
alliance. On February 23<sup>rd</sup> 1998, he brought together the leaders
of several Islamist organizations in Afghanistan and declared the establishment
of “The Islamic International Front for the Struggle against the Crusades
and the Jews (“The Front”). An Islamic <i>Fatwah</i> was published signed
by five leaders of Islamist groups: Osama Bin Laden as head of Al-Qa`idah,
Ayman al-Zawahiri head of one of the factions of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad,
Ahmad Rifa`I Taha the leader of the Egyptian Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah,
Sheikh Mir Hamzah the Amir of Jamiat-ul-Ulama-e-Pakistan, and the leader
of the Jihad movement of Bangladesh. This <i>Fatwah</i> declared the killing
of Americans and their allies—civilians and military personnel alike—as
a religious duty. Such a duty is incumbent on Muslims all over the world
in order to liberate the “occupied” holy mosque in Mecca, meaning Saudi
Arabia, and Al-Aqsa Mosque, meaning Palestine in general and Jerusalem
in .(9)
<p><b>Operations carried out against Jewish and Israeli targets abroad</b>
<br>Despite the poisonous rhetoric of the Afghan Alumni, particularly bin
Laden, which is reminiscent of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” these
declarations have so far not given rise to a wave of terrorist operations
against Israeli or Jewish targets in the international arena.
<p>However, in the second half of the 1990s there were several attacks
or attempted attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad by these
organizations. The first such operation was carried out by an Islamist
who assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane in November 1990 in New York. In June
1993, a plot to carry out several operations in New York was thwarted.
The attacks were to have been carried out by an Islamist terror network
acting under the religious guidance and authorization of the blind Egyptian
Sheikh Omar `Abd al-Rahman. The group had planned to kill an American Jewish
senator, in addition to the bombing of the UN building and the FBI Headquarters.
Sa`id Nusair, the killer of Rabbi Kahane, was linked to Sheikh `Abd al-Rahman
and to the network involved in the planning of the operations thwarted
in June 1993.
<p>On April 19<sup>th</sup> 1996, the Egyptian Al-Gama'ah al-Islamiyyah
carried out a terrorist attack on tourists in the “Europe” hotel in Cairo,
in which 17 Greek tourists were killed. This was during the Israeli “Grapes
of Wrath” Operation. In its statement following the attack, the organization
claimed the attack was meant to target Israeli tourist that residing at
the hotel.
<p>The Egyptian Jihad group, led by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, which is part
of bin Laden's terrorist network, planned to carry out terrorist operations
against Israeli targets all over the world. This is according to a senior
member of the group, who was tried in Egypt on April 1999 in the case of
“The returnees from Albania.”(10)
<p>The Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has carried out three attacks
against Jewish targets in France in the framework of its terrorist activity
in that country in the mid- 1990s. These attacks included two car bombs.
One of these was near a synagogue in Lyon in 1994; the bomb was safely
defused. The second occurred near a Jewish school in Villerbane in 1995.
In this case the car was blown up and only a delay in the bell that ended
the school’s study period prevented the death of many pupils. The third
attack involved the sending of a letter bomb in 1996, to the editor of
a Jewish paper in France.
<p>In 1995 a group called “Bai`at al-Imam,” led by Sheikh Issam Muhammad
Tahir, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin, was arrested in Jordan. Among
the members of the group were several of the Afghan Alumni. They planned
to attack Israeli targets in Jordan. More members of this group were arrested
in July 1997, after they planned to cross the border to Israel to carry
out attacks.(11)
<p>The relatively small number of attacks and attempted attacks by Afghan
Alumni against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad thus far, is the consequence
of several factors. Among them the following:
<ol>
<li>
The Afghan Alumni’s struggle is directed above all against the secular
regimes in their homelands. Their first priority is the replacement of
these governments with Islamic regimes founded on the Islamic Shari`ah.</li>

<li>
The attacks on Jewish targets were merely part of the group’s terrorist
activity against their non-Muslim enemies.</li>

<li>
These groups see the US as their primary enemy, and attacks on American
targets as defense of Islam.</li>
</ol>
<b>The increase of the activity against Israel</b>
<br>In the past year, there has arisen the possibility that the Afghan Alumni
led by bin Laden have decided to focus part of their terrorism on Israeli
targets, both inside and outside of Israel. This new trend was reflected
in the arrest of an Islamist terrorist group in Jordan in December 1999.
This case illustrates a change in the activity against Israel on the part
of central activists of Al-Qa`idah.
<p>The Jordanian terror network was composed mostly of Jordanians of Palestinian
origin, as well as an Iraqi, an Algerian and Palestinians with American
passports. The detainees admitted in their interrogations that they had
been trained in Afghanistan in a training camp financed by Bin Ladin, and
were assisted by contact members of Al-Qa`idah in Afghanistan and Pakistan.(12)
Some of the them were trained in Lebanon with the help of Hizballah and
anti-Arafat Palestinians.
<p>The group planned to carry out mass attacks against Jewish and American
tourists and Christian pilgrims at the Radison hotel in Amman, at Mount
Nevo, at the check-points on the Israeli-Jordanian borders, and at the
place where Jesus was baptized.(13)
<p>One of the prominent characteristics in this case was the central part
of Palestinian Afghan Alumni among the members of the group and its collaborators
abroad. The central activists responsible for the logistics and religious
authorization for the attacks were three Palestinians who operated from
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the UK. These were Zein al-`Abedin alias “Abu
Zubaidah” originally from Gaza; Omar Abu Omar alias “Abu Qutadah” who lives
in London under political asylum; and Khalil Deek, a Palestinian with an
American passport who was arrested in Pakistan and extradited to Jordan.
<p>During the past year there have been several arrests that should warn
of the possibility of a change in bin Laden’s activities. In February 2000,
Said Hindawi, a Palestinian Afghan Alumnus who lived for many years in
Lebanon was arrested in Israel. Hindawi’s family is originally from Halhul.
Following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority his family returned
to the Palestinian Autonomy, where his father is the commander of Hebron
police. In his interrogation, Hindawi admitted that in 1998 he was trained
in guerrilla warfare and terrorism in Durante camp, one of bin Laden’s
main training camps in Afghanistan. In his possession were found illustrations
of explosives. Although he denied it, he was suspected of planning terrorist
attacks in Israel, possibly with the assistance of local Palestinians.(14)
<p>On August 21<sup>st</sup> 2000, Israel confirmed the arrest of an Islamist
terrorist network in June of this year. The commander of this network,
Nabeel `Uqal, a Palestinian from Jibalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip,
admitted to having undergone training in1997 one of bin Laden’s camps in
Afghanistan.
There he learned the use of firearms and explosives. After he returned
to the occupied territories he recruited several activists from Gaza, Judea
and Samaria, as well as Israeli Arab citizens, members of the Islamic movement
in Israel. These he planned to send for training in Afghanistan.
<p>`Uqal admitted to contacts with Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. `Uqal
told Yassin about his training in Afghanistan, and received from him money
to finance his group. The network planned to carry out large-scale operations
in Israel, including suicide operations, kidnapping IDF soldiers, and bombing
of Jewish settlements using anti-tank missiles.(15)
<p>It is unclear yet what brought bin Laden and the Afghan Alumni supported
by him to shift their policy towards an increase in terrorist attacks against
Israeli targets, not to mention to operate within the state of Israel.
Bin Laden has been criticized by other Islamist for concentrating on American
targets and neglecting the struggle for the liberation of the holy places
in Palestine. This could be the primary reason for this change, along with
the increasing involvement of Palestinians in the Islamist Front.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>Whatever the reason is, Israel must prepare for the possible need to
counter another radical Islamist terrorist adversary in the future. The
Afghan Alumni enjoy the support of Muslim states supporting terrorism such
as Afghanistan, Sudan, the Yemen, and even Iran. From these states, they
receive shelter, the sanction to train on their soil and occasionally even
active assistance in their training. They also benefit from the fortune
of Osamah Bin Laden, which is dedicated to the promotion of world Jihad
against the enemies of Islam.
<p>In the past few years, against the background of a complicated and sensitive
political processbetween Israel and the Palestinians, terrorism against
Israel has changed, in the eyes of the Israeli decision-makers, from a
tactical issue to a strategic one. The addition of the radical Afghan Alumni
to this delicate equation could increase the attempts by the rejectionist
factions to harm the peace process and to destabilize the region.
