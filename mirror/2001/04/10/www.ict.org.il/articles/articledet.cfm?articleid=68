<p><center><h2>Syrian Support to Hizballah: The Turkish Lesson</h2></center>

<p>
<P>On October 22, 1998 an agreement was signed between the governments
of Turkey and Syria in the framework of which Syria agreed to:
<UL>
<LI>
recognize the PKK as a terrorist organization and pledges to cease every
aid to the organization, whether in weapons, logistics, financing, or propaganda;</LI>

<LI>
shut down all PKK training camps on its territory and arrest the organization’s
activists;</LI>

<LI>
deport PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan from Syria and keep members of the organization
from entering<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>Syria;</LI>

<LI>
work together with Lebanon and Turkey in combating the organization’s terrorist
activity.</LI>
</UL>
One of the agreement’s clauses - Ocalan’s expulsion - was carried out even
before the treaty was signed<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">.</FONT>

<P>The agreement constitutes in fact a Syrian surrender to Turkey’s demands.
It was reached at the end of a severe crisis, following military and political
moves on the part of the Turkish government from the beginning of<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</FONT>September<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>1998,<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</FONT>along with an ultimatum from Turkish President Demirel that if Syria
did not cease its support for PKK, Turkey would have no recourse but the
military option.

<P>For years Turkey has tried, to no avail, to influence or to coerce Syria
to cease its support for the PKK, which has put in jeopardy the territorial
integrity and the internal stability of Turkey since 1984, when it first
became active. The aid<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>to
the PKK was instrumental for Syria in its dispute with Turkey over territory
and rights to water sources originating in Turkey. Every one of the understandings
and agreements signed in the past was consistently and openly violated
by<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>the Syrian regime--notwithstanding
political or economic pressures.

<P>What then liesbehind Turkey’s recent power play and its success? A combination
of factors worked toward moving the Turkish authorities to take resolute
and effective action at this time<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
The successes of the Turkish army and security forces in countering PKK’s
activity, both in Turkey and in northern Iraq, which significantly weakened
the operational capabilities of the organization<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
On the other hand, the feeling that the organization is on the verge of
a political breakthrough - including recognition by European governments
and the European Union<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
The determination shown during the last year by the secular Turkish regime,
with the backing of the military, to fight Islamic fundamentalism. This
resolve led to the removal of the Islamic Welfare Party from power and
the reduction of Iranian involvement in Turkey’s internal affairs.</LI>

<LI>
The American example of total war on terrorism, primarily the American
missile strikes on Osama bin Ladin’s bases in Afghanistan and the chemical
plant in Sudan, but also the understanding of the American need for Turkish
support in<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>the Iraqi crisis.</LI>

<LI>
The strategic agreement with Israel, which reinforced the Turkish leadership’s
feeling of Syria’s strategic isolation.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
Is it possible for<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>Israel
to accomplish a similar feat? Could Syria be forced to cease its support
for Hizballah’s terrorist and guerrilla activities against Israel, or to
give up its sponsorship of Palestinian opposition groups? Some of these
groups, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are capable of significant
damage to the peace process.

<P>This question is of even greater import now, when the issue of Israel’s
withdrawal from Lebanon is raised on the background of heavy losses in
Southern Lebanon, and the United States is trying to renew the peace process
with Syria.<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"></FONT>

<P>Historically, Israeli policy, and that of other Western states, including
the United States has been exceedingly cautious in the face of <A HREF="../inter_ter/st_terror/syrian_terror.htm">Syrian
support for terrorist organizations</A>--an approach that has had no real
impact on Syrian policy.<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>Syria
did not pay a significant price for its backing of the terror activities
of Hizballah against the American, French and Israeli forces in Lebanon--activities
that in the end forced the Americans and the French out of Lebanon. Israel
for its part was forced to retreat to the security zone, where it continues
to incur casualties.

<P>Only recently, Mustapha Tlass, the Syrian Army Commander boasted that
in 1983 he gave the green light to the Islamic organizations to act against
the American and French forces in Lebanon. However, he said, facetiously,
he did not permit operations against the Italians because he was enamored
of the Italian film star, Gina Lolobrigida! Has any Western government
reacted at all to this little scoop?<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"></FONT>

<P>The United States bombed Libya in 1986 for its support of anti-American
terrorist acts, but was careful not to adopt the same policy when it became
clear that Syria was behind an attempt to blow up an El Al plane in the
air enroute from London.<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"></FONT>

<P>All of Israel’s leaders have declared that without the approval of Syria,
Hizballah could not act in Lebanon; that Iranian aid to Hizballah arrives
through the good offices of Syria; that all the Palestinian terrorist organizations
operate headquarters and training camps either in Syria or in the Syrian
controlled Baka’a Valley. Yet, Israel<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</FONT>has never taken any significant action against Syria, even when
it was clear that it was using Hizballah as a bargaining chip in the negotiations
with Israel at Wye Plantation in 1996.

<P>In light of the Turkish success in bringing about a real change in Syria’s
attitude toward the PKK, it seems that there is a need to reevaluate and
revise Israel’s strategy regarding the Syrian support for Hizballah and
Palestinian terrorism. Actually, most of the political and strategic factors
that worked for the benefit of Turkey in<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</FONT>the last crisis, exist also in the case of Israel<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
The American policy favoring decisive action against states that sponsor
terrorism. It is necessary to explain to the American government, public
opinion and media that this policy can not be applied successfully if<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</FONT>states such as Syria continue to benefit from leniency with regard
to their support of terrorism</LI>

<LI>
The strategic agreement between Israel and Turkey works both ways, and
Syria’s apprehensions about the alliance should be exploited in the framework
of the struggle against terrorism.</LI>

<LI>
Iran,<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>the main sponsor of
Hizballah, and Syria’s sole remaining strategic partner, has been weakened
recently due to internal strife in the regime, even if this is not yet
evident as regards Iran’s policy toward Israel.</LI>

<LI>
Israel must not repeat the mistake of engaging in negotiations under American
auspices, while giving Syria a free hand to use terrorism from Lebanon
to reinforce its tactical positions.</LI>

<LI>
Israel cannot continue to accuse the Palestinian Authority of not acting
consistently against terrorism and its infrastructure, while at the same
time ignoring the use to which Syria puts the same terrorism. This dual
policy will become all the more acute as the negotiations for a permanent
settlement draw near, and the Palestinian Authority will be tempted to
use terrorism or violence to further its strategic goals<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
And last but not least, while the “The Lion of Damascus” may well have
nerves of steel, it was shown that he knows how to retreat when he senses
his adversary’s determination to put an end to the policy of blackmail.</LI>
</UL>
Over the past few years the public discussion of the problem of terrorism
from Lebanon<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </FONT>has centered
only on two options: a Israeli unilateral withdrawal without prior security
arrangements; or a withdrawal in the framework of a general settlement,
which would enable Syria to reap the fruits of its occupation of Lebanon
and ensure the recovery of the Golan Heights at minimal cost. The time
has come to look at the new strategic map and examine other options.<FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"></FONT>
