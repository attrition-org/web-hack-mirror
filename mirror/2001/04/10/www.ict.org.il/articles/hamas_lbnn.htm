<h2>
Hamas Expanding its Activity in the Lebanese Palestinian Refugee Camps</h2></center>
<b>Reuven Paz,</b>
<br><b>ICT Academic Director</b>
<p>Over the past few months Hamas has been expanding its activity and influence
in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. One vehicle for this expansion
is a London-based center called “The Palestinian Return Center” (PRC).
In November 1998 the center opened an Internet site, which at this time
is still under construction. The stated aims of the PRC activity are as
follows:
<ul>
<li>
To promoting the Palestinians “right of return.”</li>

<li>
To work to preserve the Palestinian identity and resist attempts to resettle
the Palestinians of the Diaspora.</li>

<li>
To widen the awareness of the general public of the facts and issues concerning
the plight of the Palestinian people.</li>

<li>
To introduce the general public in Europe, and especially in Britain, to
the true dimensions of the Palestinian issue in general, in addition to
the rights that were conceded through the peace accords.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
The center is supposed to act through donations from sympathizers, both
individuals and associations. Its directors claim that the center is not
identified with any particular political trend in the Palestinian public.
However, the linkage of its site on the internet to the official sites
of Hamas and the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood show that its ideological
alliance is with the Palestinian Islamic movement. As such it serves the
interests of the Palestinian opposition to the reconciliation process between
Israel, the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. The contents of its publication,
<i>Al-Awdah</i>
(The Return) also demonstrates an indirect connection with Hamas. The infiltration
of Hamas to the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon is also reflected
in the past few months in data and articles of its central organ, the monthly
<i>Filasteen al-Muslimah</i>, also published in London.
<p>Hamas has recently founded a new Islamic body in Lebanon—“The Association
of the Islamic Clerics of Palestine in Lebanon” (<i>Tajammu` ‘Ulama Filastin</i>
in Lebanon). This association is meant to serve as the movement’s highest
Islamic council for the conduct of its activity among the Palestinians
in Lebanon. The association is identical to the “Association of Islamic
Clerics of Palestine,” a front group created by Hamas three years ago in
the Territories. It is also identical to the “Association of Islamic Clerics
in Lebanon and the Beqa` Valley.” This later is a very active front institution
that was founded in the 1980s on Iranian initiative, in order to consolidate
Shi`ite and Sunni clerics in Lebanon under the patronage of Iran and Hizballah.
<p>The establishment of this latest Palestinian institution in Lebanon
was announced at a press conference in Siddon in November 1998. Siddon
is home to a number of veteran Sunni Islamic groups composed of Lebanese
and Palestinians, the most prominent being <i>Al-Jama`ah al-Islamiyyah</i>.
Representatives of various Palestinian organizations and refugee camps
in Lebanon took part in the press conference. The founding of the association
was consecrated by several prestigious Islamic clerics—the Sunni <i>Mufti</i>
of Lebanon, Sheikh Muhammad Rashid Qabbani; the spiritual leader of Hizballah,
Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah; the Chairman of the High Shi`ite Council,
Sheikh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din; and the Secretary General of Al-Jama`ah
al-Islamiyyah in Saida Sheikh Faisal Mawlawi.
<p>The association is headed by Sheikh Daud Mustafa and is composed of
67 Islamic clerics and an 11 members executive committee. In his speech
at the press conference Sheikh Mustafa determined the basic objectives
of the association as follows:
<ul>
<li>
The protection of the Palestinian people and its rights, together with
its bolstering by Islam in order to carry on its role in the Jihad.</li>

<li>
The dissemination of the message that Palestine is Arabic and Islamic soil
and that the Jihad for its liberation is a sacred duty.</li>

<li>
The promotion of the awareness of the Palestinian people to the need to
oppose the disintegration of the Palestinian issue.</li>

<li>
The strengthening of the Islamic activity in the Palestinian public in
all dimensions.</li>
</ul>
The infiltration of Hamas into the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon
is a new phenomenon. The movement has been altogether absent in these camps
since the establishment<i> </i>of Hamas and its mother organization, the
Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood at the beginning of the <i>Intifadah</i>.
This infiltration has started mainly since the consolidation of the ten
opposition groups that oppose the reconciliation process between Israel
and the Palestinians. These groups are concentrated in Damascus under Syrian
patronage. They held a joint convention in Damascus on the eve of President
Clinton’s visit in Gaza to protest the abolition of the anti-Israel clauses
in the Palestinian Charter.
<p>This infiltration can be understood in the context of several recent
changes in the Palestinian situation in Lebanon. First there is the void
left by the Fath organization in the refugee camps in Lebanon in the wake
of the removal of its headquarters to the Territories. Secondly, the diminishing
support for the political process with Israel, and the transfer of the
Palestinian “center of mass” to the Territories in the wake of the establishment
of the Palestinian Authority. And lastly, there is the perceived disregard—in
the course of the negotiations with Israel—for the issue of the return
of the refugees.
<p>The void left by Fath in Lebanon brought about the increasing activity
of rival groups, which were close to the Syrians. However, these groups
have difficulty in enlarging their support due to of the lack of novelty
of their message, the aging of their leadership and their lack of financial
resources. Hamas, on the other hand, can present itself as the central
Palestinian opposition force, and the central legitimate alternative in
the Territories to the Palestinian Authority. The movement has a relatively
large public following, and above all, is the main Palestinian element
that has not only not abandoned the policy of armed struggle, but engages
in intensive terrorist activities against Israel.
<p>Another advantage of Hamas in its activity in Lebanon is its relations
with Hizballah and Iran, its financial resources and its traditional activity
as a Muslim Brotherhood organization in a variety of social and communal
issues. Furthermore, Hamas has much greater independence than do such groups
as PFLP, PDFLP, Abu-Musa etc., which act in Lebanon under Syrian patronage—a
factor that greatly limits their activity.
<p>The establishment of “The Association of Islamic clerics of Palestine
in Lebanon” illustrates the strengthening of the relationship between Hamas
and Hizballah. This is especially noticeable in its similarity to the older
body established at the initiative of Hizballah and Iran, and its connections
to Al-Jama`ah al-Islamiyyah in Siddon—one of the few Sunni Islamic groups
in the Arab world under Iranian influence since the early 1980s.
<p>It should be pointed out that the expansion of Hamas’ activity in Lebanon
might also widen the gap between the “internal leadership” in the Territories
and the “external leadership” in the Diaspora. Furthermore, the social
development of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon in the past 50 years
under the influence of the PLO was directed toward a clear nationalist-secular
conception. However, the social and political developments of the Shi`ite
community in Lebanon since 1982 and the strong influence of the Iranian
supported Islamic movements there may serve as a model for the Palestinians
too.
<p>It would seem that from an Israeli point of view, the Islamist activity
in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon brings with it the risk of
further strengthening the Iranian elements and Hizballah in that country,
by swelling their ranks with reinforcements whose past is replete with
violence. At present this phenomenon seems to be in its infancy. However
the large-scale socio-political activity of Hamas in these camps may strengthen
the Islamist hold over this part of the Palestinian public. This, plus
future developments in the talks with Israel, which will put the emphasis
on the Territories at the expense of “the right of return” may also have
internal consequences on the Lebanese scene relevant to Israel. The most
important of these are the implications for the overall situation in Southern
Lebanon and the possibility of terrorism against Israel from Lebanese territory
in the case of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the security zone.
