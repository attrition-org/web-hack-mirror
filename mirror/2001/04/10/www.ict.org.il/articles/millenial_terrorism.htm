Extremism, like all sociological phenomena,
waxes and wanes according to a complex mix of economic and political factors,
and threats from such groups are nothing new. But the approaching turn
of the millennium is different. What gives this year’s celebrations an air
of urgency for those entrusted with public security is the coincidence
of religious, political and technological milestones.&nbsp;
<p>For many Christians, the year 2000, or “Y2K” symbolizes the beginning of
the prophesied “End Times.” For most of the world, the number is associated
with the possible collapse of the world’s digital networks, as their computers
fail to recognize the difference between the years 2000 and 1900. In addition,
the secular New Year this year falls in the middle of the Muslim Holy month
of Ramadan.

<p>So while some religious groups are awaiting the onset of the “End Times,”
characterized by social and political upheaval, people from all walks of
life—from government to business—are anxiously waiting to see if essential
utilities and communications will collapse as their computers succumb to
the Y2K bug.
<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation carried out a nine-month long
analysis of the possible threat of domestic terrorism from apocalyptic
groups. The final report, “<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/library/megiddo/publicmegiddo.pdf">Project
Megiddo</a>” emphasized that the risk, though difficult to pin down to
any one group, was quite real nonetheless:
<blockquote>As the end of the millennium draws near, biblical prophecy
and political philosophy may merge into acts of violence by the more extreme
members of domestic terrorist groups that are motivated, in part, by religion.
The volatile mix of apocalyptic religions and NWO conspiracy theories may
produce violent acts aimed at precipitating the end of the world as prophesied
in the Bible. [Project Megiddo, p. 7]</blockquote>
<a NAME="Ideologies"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Apocalyptic
Ideologies</font></font></b>
<p>The <i>Mirriam-Webster English Dictionary</i> defines “ideology” as:
“1) visionary theorizing; 2) a: a systematic body of concepts especially
about human life or culture; b: a manner or the content of thinking characteristic
of an individual, group, or culture; c: the integrated assertions, theories
and aims that constitute a sociopolitical program.”
<p>The term “ideology” here will be used to refer to any worldview—whether
religious, racial or political—that serves to unify and motivate a group
of people. We will concentrate here on the various millennial ideologies,
in an attempt to find common factors indicative of a worldview’s potential
for violence.
<p>The theme of “apocalypticism,” though generally associated with religious
worldviews, actually appears in a number of secular politically or racial
ideologies as well. Broadly defined, the term refers to a view of history
as a one-directional process, marked by clearly delineated milestones.
Such beliefs are clearly evident in worldviews as diverse as Marxism, Evangelical
Christianity and some varieties of primitive animism.
<p>The more common apocalyptic ideologies can be divided into three main
groups: religious, racial, and historical. Adherents of apocalyptic worldviews
often hold a combination of these beliefs simultaneously. For example the
worldview of many white supremacists, though essentially racially motivated
is also built on a foundation of religious beliefs.
<p><a NAME="religious_ideologies"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Religious
Ideologies</font></i></b>
<p>Religious Apocalypticism focuses on cryptic revelations about a sudden,
dramatic, and cataclysmic intervention of God in history, the judgment
of all men, the salvation of the faithful elect, and the eventual rule
of the elect with God in a renewed heaven and earth. In the Judeo-Christian
religions apocalypticism is based upon two main scriptural sources: the
Book of Daniel in the Old Testament, and the Book of Revelation in the
New Testament.
<p><b>Christian Eschatology</b>
<p>In Christianity the apocalyptic worldview usually surfaces as Millennialism
(from the Latin word for 1,000). Millennialism is a both a theological
standpoint and a religious movement now associated with such modern Protestant
sects as the Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and certain segments of many
Protestant denominations. The term is derived from the imagery of the New
Testament Book of Revelation (Rev. 20), in which the writer describes a
vision of Satan being bound and thrown into a bottomless pit and of Christian
martyrs being raised from the dead and reigning with Christ for 1,000 years.
This 1,000-year period, known as the millennium, is viewed as a time during
which man’s yearnings for peace, freedom from evil, and the rule of righteousness
upon earth are finally realized through the power of God. At the end of
the period, Satan is to be loosed for a time to unify the nations of the
world under a single evil government, before being ultimately defeated.
All the dead are then to be gathered for the final judgment.[See Tabor,
James. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/explanation/brevelation.html" target="_new">The
Book of Revelations</a>]
<p>Many different interpretations of the millennium have been given. Some,
called premillennialists, believe that the Second Coming of Christ will
begin the 1,000-year period of righteousness in the world. Others, known
as postmillennialists, the Second Coming will occur only at the end of
this 1,000-year period, during which Christianity will be accepted throughout
the world. The climax of this period of Christian righteousness will be
the return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment.
<p>Common to all forms of Christian apocalypticism is the belief that the
Second Coming will begin with an apocalyptic final conflict, which will
engulf the entire world. What makes some of these beliefs dangerous is
the fact that their believers see themselves as the harbingers or catalysts
of this final conflict. There is a real danger that these people will take
steps to set off the cataclysm, which they believe is necessary to bring
about the return of the Messiah. Some adherents of apocalypticism see themselves
as martyrs who will, by their deaths, set off the battle of the righteous
against Satan. In addition, apocalyptic Christians the world over tend
to view either their own government, or the United Nations as the Evil
Empire of Revelations, which is destined to launch a war against the Christians.
<p><b>Evangelism, the Jews and Israel</b>
<p>Almost all apocalyptic Christian groups feel quite passionate about the Jews
and/or about Israel, this passion taking the form of a kind of love/hate
relationship in some cases and virulent anti-Semitism in others. In the
United States, the Christian right is one of the staunchest supporters
of Israel. The motives for such support are not always clear. In Genesis
15:18, God gives the land of Israel to the Jews, and for most fundamentalist
Christians that settles the matter. However, in the worldview of most evangelists,
the Second Coming will occur only after the destruction of Israel in the
apocalyptic meeting between Christ and the Antichrist at Armageddon, or
Megiddo. Those Jews who survive this catastrophe—only a hundred and forty-four
thousand, according to some interpretations of the Scripture—will finally
turn to Jesus as the true Messiah. [Wright, Lawrence. “<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/readings/forcing.html" target="_new">Forcing
the End</a>”]
<p><b>Jewish Apocalypticism</b>
<p>Judaism too has its version of the apocalypse. In fact, eschatology
originally entered Christianity by way of the Jewish Scriptures. Old Testament
eschatology centers on the conviction that the catastrophes that beset
the people of Israel happened because of the Jewish people’s disobedience
to the laws and will of God. Subsequent conformity to the will of God will
result in the spiritual and physical redemption of the Jewish people. Because
the Scriptural references upon which this belief are based were almost
all written during periods of exile, this redemption takes the form of
the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel and the reestablishment of
the Golden Age of the Kingdom of David. But the return also has a spiritual
component, in the form of a return to righteousness in compliance with
the Law. Only after the symbolic cleansing of the Jewish people, will Israel
be “a light to the nations” tasked with spreading God’s word to the other
nations of the world.
<p>Jewish eschatology is thus closely bound up with the concept of a redemptive
history, in which the Jewish people are viewed as God’s chosen instrument
for the carrying out of his purpose. Thus upon the fulfillment of God’s
promises, the Jewish people are to be the vehicle for both their own salvation
and that of the rest of the world.
<p>Throughout history Jewish apocalypticism has waxed and waned with the
fortunes of the Jewish people. However, with the establishment of the State
of Israel, such beliefs have come to be seen by many Jews as a tangible
pattern being worked out in modern history. The recapture of the Old City
of Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War, brought about a distinct
change in Jewish apocalyptic yearnings. For the first time in over 2,000
years, a Jewish government controlled the Temple Mount, the site of the
first two Jewish Temples. Several prominent rabbinical authorities came
to believe that Israel was already living in the End Time, and that the
Jews must now do their part to prepare the way for the Messiah.
<p>But preparing for the Messiah is not a mere spiritual matter. In the
modern reality of the Middle East, it has significant political overtones.
The Temple Mount is holy not just to Jews, but over Islamic history has
come to be regarded as the third holiest shrine of Islam as well. It is
the site of two venerated Islamic holy places—the Dome of the Rock, and
the al-Aqsa Mosque, from which according to legend Mohammed ascended to
Heaven.
<p>In an article entitled, “<a href="http://www.ict.org.il/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=52" target="_new">The
Threat of Jewish Terrorism in Israel</a>,” ICT Islamic expert, Reuven Paz
emphasized the growing importance of these shrines to Islam:
<blockquote>Jerusalem in general and the Aqsa Mosque in particular have
since 1967 achieved an increasing importance in the eyes of most of the
Arab Muslim world, both for governments and for peoples. The radical Islamic
revival in the Arab world has succeeded in establishing Jerusalem and the
Mosque as the major point of contention between Israel and the Arabs.</blockquote>
The situation is made all the more volatile by the fact that this elevation
in sanctity comes at this particular point in history:
<blockquote>This increase in the sanctity of the of al-Aqsa to Muslims
takes place on the background of the growing importance of Jerusalem and
the Temple Mount to the Israelis in general and to Jewish religious-political
groups in particular, particularly since 1967. The issue of Jerusalem has
become crucial to both sides, not only as a point of political dispute,
but even more as the focus of religious-Messianic contention.
<p>Any attempt therefore, to carry out a terrorist operation in the area
of the Aqsa Mosque could be interpreted in the Arab world as part of the
Muslim-Jewish global war.</blockquote>
The complexity of the matter was illustrated by Lawrence Wright, in his
article, “<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/readings/forcing.html" target="_new">Forcing
the End</a>”:
<blockquote>Soon after the Six-Day War was over, Shlomo Goren, who later
became the Chief Rabbi of Israel, led a group of fifty followers onto the
Mount, where they fought off Muslim guards and Israeli police and conducted
a prayer service. A week later, the Chief Rabbinate ordered that signs
be placed in front of the gates saying that no Jews should set foot on
the Temple Mount. The reasoning was that, because Jews are ritually impure,
they might accidentally step on the place where the Holy of Holies once
stood. Such a desecration is punishable by death at the hand of God. This
was supposed to put the Temple Mount theologically off limits…</blockquote>
Despite this proscription, there are several Jewish fundamentalist groups
who are convinced that the time to rebuild the Temple is now at hand. The
obvious drawback is that the Third Temple cannot be built while the Muslim
shrines still stand. There have been several serious attempts to blow up
the Muslim holy places. Both Israeli and Islamic authorities are extremely
concerned that the ill-conceived actions of a small number of Jewish fanatics
may set off a violent confrontation between Muslims and Jews.
<p>One of the more volatile Jewish apocalyptic groups is the Temple Mount
Faithful, led by Gershon Salomon. Among the group’s stated long-term objectives
is “Liberating the Temple Mount from Arab (Islamic) occupation.” According
to the Temple Mount Faithful, “The Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa mosque
were placed on this Jewish or Biblical holy site as a specific sign of
Islamic conquest and domination.” While the Temple Mount Faithful do not
directly call for the destruction of the Muslim shrines, their own suggestion,
“that they be removed, transferred to and rebuilt at Mecca,” does not appear
to convey much conviction, even within the group itself. [<a href="http://www.templemountfaithful.org/obj.htm" target="_new">http://www.templemountfaithful.org/obj.htm</a>]
<p>The secular millennium holds no significance for orthodox Jews, who eschew
secular New Year celebrations as being alien to Judaism. The irony is that
it is precisely here that Jewish apocalyptic aspirations coincide with
those of the fundamentalist Christians, who foresee a cataclysmic war in
Israel. For nothing would be as sure to set off such a war as the fulfillment
of the designs of the Temple Mount Faithful. Any harm to the Muslim shrines
on the Temple Mount would be almost certain to bring about a violent confrontation—one
that could easily rage out of control.
<p>Nadav Shragai, a reporter for the Israeli newspaper <i>Ha’aretz </i>and
the author of a 1995 book, “The Temple Mount Conflict,” estimates that
there are about a thousand active supporters of the most radical Temple
Mount movements.[Quoted in Wright] The potential of the Temple Mount Faithful
to stir up conflict in this most sensitive of places is illustrated by
an event that occurred in 1990. Salomon led a group of his followers to
the Mount in order to lay a “cornerstone” for the Third Temple. As many
as five thousand Muslims of all ages turned out to “defend the sanctuaries,”
and began hurling stones onto Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall below.
The situation rapidly deteriorated into a riot. The Israeli authorities,
who had failed to reinforce a police garrison on the Mount, dispatched
border guards to control the situation. In the resulting struggle seventeen
Muslims were killed and hundreds of people on both sides wounded.
<p>Just how sensitive the site is can be seen in the fact that the opening
of an archeological site near the Temple Mount to tourism in September
1996, led to riots by Muslims throughout the country. In the disturbances
eighty people were killed..
<p>In a way, the Temple Mount Faithful are only the extreme manifestation
of an underlying trend in Jewish fundamentalism, whose more moderate expressions
can be seen in the increasing political activity of Israel’s religious
population.
<p>Some see the increasing political involvement of religious Jews as stemming
primarily from an apocalyptic view of modern history. According to Emmanuel
Sivan of Hebrew University, “Jewish fundamentalism of the nationalist branch
is mostly the product of the Six Day War. The fact is that until ‘67 the
national religious camp was a very moderate Zionist movement. It has turned
extremist because of this apocalyptic vision.” [Quoted in Wright]
<p>Fortunately, the more extreme forms of apocalypticism are in a vast
minority in Israel, and are actively represented in only a few organized
movements. Israel’s General Security Service is faced with the unenviable
task of struggling to keep abreast of every possible provocation by such
groups, in a region where a single spark can set off a sweeping conflagration.
<p><b>Islam and the Apocalypse</b>
<p>Islam is not a messianic religion and has no room for a savior-messiah.
However there is in Islam a kind of counterpart to the Christian messiah,
in the form of an eschatological restorer of the faith. The concept probably
owes a good deal to Christian influence, as the restorer is sometimes identified
with the returning ‘Isa (Jesus). However, he is usually considered to be
a descendant of the Prophet and is referred to as the mahdi, or the “guided
one,” who will usher in the Day of Judgment. [9]
<p>The Day of Judgment is one of the five cardinal beliefs of Muslims.
After death, everyone is questioned about their faith by two angels: Munkar
and Nakir. Only those who died as martyrs are guaranteed an immediate place
in paradise; all others go through a type of purgatory.
<p>Islam usually views the outward manifestations of the End Time pessimistically:
God will abandon the godless world. The Ka’bah (the great pilgrimage sanctuary
of the Muslim world) will vanish, the copies of the Qur’an will become
empty paper, and its words will disappear from memory. At doomsday all
will die and be resurrected and judged according to his deeds in life.
<p>These beliefs, though similar in some ways to Christian eschatology
are not linked in any significant way with the coming millennium. In fact,
the Gregorian year 2000 has no significance at all in Islam; by the Muslim
calendar the secular New Year will occur in the middle of the year 1420.
<p>Writing on the significance of the millennium to modern Muslims, UK
Islamic scholar, Abdal Hakim Murad emphasized that while, the passing of
the first millennium of the Muslim calendar raised the same type of anxiety
that is currently sweeping believing Christians, this milestone was safely
passed several hundred years back. [Murad, Abdal Hakim. “<a href="http://ds.dial.pipex.com/masud/ISLAM/ahm/millen.htm" target="_new">Islam
and the New Millenium</a>”]
<blockquote>Imam al-Suyuti, the greatest scholar of medieval Egypt, was
concerned about the nervous expectations many Muslims had about the year
1000 of the <i>hija</i>. Would it herald the end of the world, as many
thought?
<p>Imam al-Suyuti allayed these fears by examining all the hadith he could
find about the lifetime of this Umma. He wrote a short book which he called
al-Kashf an <i>mujawazat hadhihi al-umma al-Alf</i> (‘Proof that this Umma
will survive the millennium’).</blockquote>
However, Murad does point out one rather ironic outcome of this work:
<blockquote>But rather soberingly for our generation, he speculates that
the hadiths at his disposal indicate that the signs which will usher in
the return of Isa (a.s.), and the Antichrist (<i>al Masih al-Dajjal</i>),
are most likely to appear in the fifteenth Islamic century; in other words,
our own.[Ibid.]</blockquote>
According to Reuven Paz, none of these beliefs are such as to motivate
Islamic groups to violence in connection with the turn of the millennium,
as the secular millennium holds no significance for Islam. Thus Islamic
apocalypticism is not a primary danger either in Israel or in other countries.
This is not to say that Islamic groups will not carry out actions during
the secular millennium, but only that such actions will stem from operational
concerns alone and not from any apocalyptic beliefs.
<p><a NAME="racial_supremacy"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Racial Supremacy</font></i></b>
<p>The principle racially motivated apocalyptic ideologies stem from intense
and usually mystical beliefs in the innate superiority of one race above
all others. In many of these ideologies the superior race is seen as the
descended from some mythical “chosen race.” Invariably this race is seen
as a persecuted minority, involved in an ongoing race war with the inferior
races of the world. This war is destined to end in a final cataclysm, in
which the chosen race will utterly destroy or enslave all the others and
will take its place as ruler of the world.
<p>One of the factors making racial supremacy so dangerous is the fact
that this worldview is so often founded on religious beliefs or itself
constitutes a religion. Thus the adherent of such a worldview combines
the intensity of religious belief with the virulent xenophobia of the racist.
<p><b>Conspiracy Theories</b>
<p>Racial Supremacist ideologies often revolve around intricate conspiracy
theories, which serve to explain how the chosen race is kept from assuming
its rightful place by the combined action of the other races of the world.
Without such a conspiracy, in the eyes of the racial supremacist ideology
there would be no explanation of how an innately superior race is kept
“enslaved” by an inferior one. The need for such explanation stems from
the tenant underlying most supremacist worldviews that the chosen race’s
superiority is one of “fitness” to rule or to survive. It is this evolutionary
point of view that makes such ideologies so amenable to an apocalyptic
view of history.
<p>A number of the main apocalyptic racial supremacy groups are based in
the United States, and were given special attention by the FBI’s report
on the threat of apocalyptic violence, “Project Megiddo.” For the most
part adherents of these ideologies present a threat of domestic rather
than international terrorism. Yet the fact that followers of these ideologies
have already been involved in a number of racially motivated murders and
indiscriminate attacks in several different countries clearly illustrates
the potential for violence inherent in such beliefs.
<p>Central to many of these conspiracy theories is the notion that the
United Nations has a secret plan to take over the world and set up a world
government, beginning in the year 2000. This is known as the New World
Order (NWO) conspiracy. The New World Order take-over is to be activated
by the Y2K computer crisis. The New World Order conspiracy is not limited
to the UN. Adherents of the NWO conspiracy theory believe that the conspiracy
also involves such diverse groups as the Jews, the World Monetary Fund,
the Communists, and the American Council on Foreign Relations. Believers
point to the merging of European currency, the Y2K bug and a number of
other signs and portents as allegedly supporting their beliefs.[Project
Megiddo, see also Jensen, Carl J. <a href="http://www.mille.org/jensen.html" target="_new">Law
Enforcement and the Millennialist Vision: A Behavioral Approach </a>]
<p><a NAME="doomsday_cults"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Historical Eschatology:
Doomsday Cults</font></i></b>
<p>The term “cult” is often used by members of established religions as
a derogatory term to refer to other non-standard religions. Here the term
will be used in a very narrow sense to refer only to a group of individuals
who have surrendered their own will and opinions to that of a charismatic
leader. Cults generally have a very rigid hierarchical structure in which
the cult leader is seen as the ultimate authority. These groups, though
often enigmatic and sometimes contentious generally are not a danger to
the society around them.
<p>However, Those cults motivated by apocalyptic worldviews, even when
not constituting a present danger to their societies generally have the
potential to do so. At the very least, they can present a to their own
members, as for example the Heavens Gate and Solar Temple cults, both of
whose members were induced to participate in mass suicides.
<p>The ideology of apocalyptic cults revolves around the cult as a harbinger
of a new age for humanity. Often they see the cult leader as a prophet,
a messiah, or even the personification of a deity. A number of such cults
ascribe supernatural powers to the cult leader and to a lesser degree to
the inner circle. They often view these powers as indicative of their superiority
over the rest of humanity. Cult members tend to see themselves as being,
not only the future participants in a new era, but those who will bring
about the next phase of human history.
<p>Almost universally the millennium is held to be the time during which
this new phase is to begin, often after a cataclysmic war. Some apocalyptic
cults see themselves as the destined survivors of the cataclysm. Others
see themselves as being essential to the occurrence of the cataclysm. While
the former are most concerned with preparing themselves to survive the
end of the world, it is the second type of cult that presents the greatest
danger.
<p>In order to determine which cults should be classified as “doomsday
cults,” B.A. Robinson of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance
has identified several main factors commonly found in such cults. [“<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/cultsign.htm">Factors
Commonly Found in Doomsday Cults</a>”]. These factors were present to an
extreme degree in organizations with a history of mass suicide or killing:
<p><i>Apocalyptic Beliefs:</i>
<ul>
<li>
The leader’s preaching concentrates heavily on the impending end of the
world, often at a great battle (e.g. War of Armageddon). Alternately (as
in the case of the Solar Temple and Heaven’s Gate groups) the leader preaches
that through group suicide at a particular time, they will all be transported
to a wonderful place and escape the devastation that is about to come to
the earth.</li>

<li>
The group is expected to play a major, elite role at the end time.</li>
</ul>
<i>Charismatic Leadership</i>
<ul>
<li>
They are led by a single male charismatic leader.</li>

<li>
The leader dominates the membership, closely controlling them physically,
sexually and emotionally.</li>
</ul>
<i>Social Encapsulation</i>
<ul>
<li>
They are a small religious group, not an established denomination.</li>

<li>
The group (or at least the core members) lives together in an intentional
community which is isolated from the rest of society.</li>

<li>
There is often extreme paranoia within the group; they believe that they
are in danger and that they are being closely monitored and heavily persecuted
by governments or people outside the group.</li>

<li>
People on “the outside” are demonized.</li>

<li>
Information and contacts from outside the cult are severely curtailed.</li>
</ul>
<i>Other Factors</i>
<ul>
<li>
The group leadership assembles an impressive array of guns, rifles, other
murder weapons or weapons of mass destruction. They may prepare defensive
structures.</li>

<li>
They follow a form of Christian theology (or a blend of Christianity with
another religion), with major and unique deviations from traditional beliefs
in the area of end-time prophecy</li>
</ul>
Many intentional communities and most religious groups exhibit a few of
the above factors. They are probably not dangerous, because some of the
factors are absent and/or because the factors are not practiced to an intense
degree.
<p><i>Ex: Concerned Christians, House of Yahweh</i>
<p>Many apocalyptic groups are inspired by science fiction scenarios or
a belief in alien visitations. Last summer around 60 members of the Stella
Maris Gnostic church went missing in the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern
Colombia where they were due for an alleged rendezvous with a spaceship.
They were hoping to be carried off by extraterrestial beings in time to

believed the extraterrestials would rescue 140,000 people in a kind of
new Noah’s Ark.

<p><a NAME="common_themes"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Common Themes</font></i></b>
<p>While apocalyptic worldviews can be motivated by religious beliefs or
by political or racist ideologies, a number of common themes can be seen
running through most of these worldviews. These common themes include:
<p><i>Isolationism/nationalism</i> – the group sees itself as constituting
an elite, separate from the rest of humanity. This isolationism can be
that of a race, a nation or a cult.
<p><i>Extreme paranoia</i> – members of the group are convinced that they
are persecuted by powerful enemies, that they are under surveillance by
their governments, or that the world is somehow united against them.
<p><i>Xenophobia</i> – outsiders are feared and hated by members of the
group. To some extent this is a function of the group’s paranoid “us-against-them”
outlook.
<p><i>Belief in historical destiny for the elite</i> – members of the group
see themselves as destined to bring in a new era, or to fulfill an ancient
prophecy. Often they believe themselves to be the only ones destined to
survive the imminent destruction of the world. Such a belief reinforces
the group’s view of itself as superior to the rest of humanity.
<p><i>Dualism</i> – members of the group see the world as being divided
into two opposing camps of Good and Evil. Events on the local scene are
viewed as evidence of this great cosmic struggle.
<p><b>Nationalism and Internationalism</b>
<p>For many people, the theme of the millennium is “unification.” The growth
of the Internet has done more than anything else to erase national borders,
while in world economic interdependence is greater than ever before. Not
everyone is happy with these developments.
<p>Oddly enough, one of the common threads running through most apocalyptic
worldviews, whether evangelical or conspiracy theories is the role played
by global unification, as embodied by the increasing ascendancy of the
United Nations in world affairs. In both worldviews, the apocalypse is
preceded by the formation of “one world government” under the control of
the United Nations.
<p>Perhaps this is not so surprising. Paranoia thrives on disorder and
lack of cohesion; extremist worldviews have always vigorously opposed the
“threat” of internationalism. Naturally many of the paranoids of the world
view increasing internationalization—the advent of the “global village”—as
a threatening development.
<p>Typical of the paranoid worldview is the theme of “us against them.”
Such a worldview is essentially xenophobic—it requires an external enemy,
and in the absence of such will happily invent one. Such an outlook is
in direct contrast with the standpoint of the “global village,” whose theme
is “no more us and them; no more national borders.” In fact these two worldviews
are true dichotomies which, in one form or another, can be seen running
throughout all of human history. It is the classic battle between the philosophy
of the “nationalist” and that of the “internationalist.”
<p><a NAME="changes"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>The Changing
Face of Terrorism</font></font></b>
<p>One of the lessons brought into sharp relief by the efforts to combat
millennial terrorism is the changing nature of the terrorist organizations
themselves. Gone, for the most part, are the days of the clearly delineated,
hierarchically-organized terrorist group. Today’s terrorist is just as
likely to be an individual unaffiliated with any known group, who’s operational
knowledge was gleaned from the internet and who’s inspiration and marching
orders come from an extremist website. Such an individual has no defined
place in an established hierarchy and is on no government’s list of possible
terrorists.
<p>This point was particularly emphasized in the FBI’s “Project Megiddo”
in which the difficulties facing law-enforcement agencies were underscored:
<blockquote>Quite simply, the very nature of the current domestic terrorism
threat places severe limitations on effective intelligence gathering and
evaluation. Ideological and philosophical belief systems which attach importance,
and possibly violence, to the millennium have been well-articulated. From
a law enforcement perspective, the problem therefore is not a lack ofunderstanding
of motivating ideologies: The fundamental problem is that the traditional
focal point for counterterrorism analysis—the terrorist group—is not always
well-defined or relevant in the current environment.</blockquote>
The FBI report pointed out that the general trend in modern terrorism is
a movement away from the traditional, hierarchically structured terrorist
organizations. “Even well-established militias, which tend to organize
along military lines with central control,” the report said, “are characterized
by factionalism and disunity.” And although the more traditional hierarchical
terrorist groups still exist, and are still a force to be reckoned with
on the international scene “the overwhelming majority of extremist groups
in the United States have adopted a fragmented, leaderless structure where
individuals or small groups act with autonomy.” Although the FBI report
focused primarily on the threat of domestic terrorism, the same trend can
be found to some extent in international networks, such as that of Ossama
bin Ladin.
<p><a NAME="leaderless_resistance"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">The Leaderless
Resistance</font></i></b>
<p>In February 1992, an American white-supremacist named Louis Beam published
a pamphlet entitled “The Seditionist.” In this work, Beam proposed a new
strategy to be followed by what he called “the brave sons and daughters
[willing] to fight off ever increasing persecution, oppression…and tyranny”
of the U.S. federal government.
<p>Beam pointed out that the usual hierarchic structure leaves an organization
open to infiltration by security forces. Do away with the hierarchy, says
Beam, and replace the pyramid of command with individuals and cells operating
according to broadly disseminated ideology, and you do away with this vulnerability.
In such a system there is no central direction. Rather the organization
is made up of what Beam called “Phantom cells,” which operate independently
of, and unknown to, one another.
<p>Such an organization is “leaderless” in the sense that its individuals
never report to a central headquarters or a single leader for orders. However,
leadership of a sort is there nonetheless, in the form of a common ideology
and common goals.
<p>In his article “<a href="http://www.ict.org.il/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=87" target="_new">Right-wing
Terrorism on the Rise</a>,” ICT researcher Ely Karmon describes the mode
of operation of such an organization:
<blockquote>The participants in a program of Leaderless Resistance, through
phantom cells or individual action, must know exactly what they are doing,
and how to do it. It becomes the responsibility of the individual to acquire
the necessary skills and information as to what is to be done. This is
by no means as impractical as it appears, because it is certainly true
that in any movement, all persons involved have the same general outlook,
are acquainted with the same philosophy, and generally react to given situations
in similar ways.</blockquote>
The individual cells communicate by means of newspapers, leaflets and,
increasingly, the Internet. According to Beam such communications “keep
each person informed of events, allowing for a planned response that will
take many variations. No one need issue an order to anyone. Those idealists
truly committed to the cause of freedom will act when they feel the time
is ripe, or will take their cue from others who precede them.”
<p>In the words of Dr. Karmon, “Such a situation is an intelligence nightmare
for a government intent upon knowing everything they possibly can about
those who oppose them.”
<p><a NAME="adapting"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Adapting
to Changing Times</font></font></b>
<p>Among the more obvious changes in the terrorism arena is the displacement
of politically motivated terrorism by primarily religiously motivated terrorism.
The changing operational structure of terrorist organizations, as well
as the upsurge of religiously motivated terrorism requires security forces
to alter the way they fight terrorism.
<p>In the past, counter-terrorist analysis was group-oriented; the principle
task of a counter-terrorist operation was to identify an organization as
having the potential to carry out terrorist acts, name its chief members
and infiltrate or otherwise discover its operational plans. However, these
days some of the most dangerous terrorist groups operate without a centralized
structure and without identifiable leaders. In such cases, there is no
organization to infiltrate, and few pre-determined operational plans.
<p>Thus, rather than focusing on organizations as the basic “elementary
particle” of terrorism, today’s security services must focus less on groups
and more on <i>ideologies</i>. The principle task facing law enforcement
agencies will thus be to determine which ideologies should be regarded
as having the potential to inspire their adherents to carry out violence
in the service of their beliefs.
<p>This of course gives rise to some extremely thorny dilemmas for democracies,
which must walk a fine line between insuring the security of their citizens,
while at the same time allowing freedom of opinion.
<p><a NAME="evaluating"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Evaluating the Threat</font></i></b>
<p>All of the forgoing leads us to some common traits that may serve as
signs that an apocalyptic movement is potentially dangerous. For this it
is not enough that an organization or group of people follow a discernibly
apocalyptic ideology. We must be able to point to indicators that this
ideology is likely to spur its adherents to violent action.
<p><b>Danger Signs in Apocalyptic Movements</b>
<p>An analysis of this kind was given by Kevin M. Gilmartin, in “<a href="http://www.leo.gov/tlib/leb/1996/sept961/txt" target="_new">The
Lethal Triad</a>: Understanding the Nature of Isolated Extremist Groups.”
According to Gilmartin, there is a “lethal triad” of factors, which when
combined in a single group should set off danger signals for law enforcement
authorities:
<blockquote>“... <i>isolation</i><b> </b>causes a reduction of critical
thinking on the part of group members who become entrenched in the belief
proposed by the group leadership. As a result, group members relinquish
all responsibility for group decision making to their leader and blame
the cause of all group grievances on some outside entity or force, a process
known as projection. Finally, isolation and <i>projection</i><b> </b>combine
to produce pathological <i>anger</i>, the final component of the triad.”</blockquote>
Both the American Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service have recently issued reports aimed at keeping local
law enforcement agencies informed of the possible millennium violence from
cults and extremist groups.
<p>The following list combines the reports of these and other law enforcement
agencies in determining common factors and danger signs regarding potentially
dangerous apocalyptic movements.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Active apocalyptic Ideology<b> </b></i>– Apocalyptic beliefs that involve
the believer to take positive action to bring about a cataclysmic change
in history. The movement’s members see themselves as being essential players
in a cosmic drama. They feel that their action is needed to pave the way
for the victory of the forces of good over evil.</li>
</ul>

<dir>As the millennium draws near, believers may feel the need to take
immediate action to ensure their salvation.</dir>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Demonization of Outsiders </i>– believers feel that their salvation
and the victory of the forces of good depends on the eradication of their
enemies. The profound xenophobia of such movements leads them to demonize
all those that do not belong to the movement. The group is always on the
verge of anticipating confrontation, which justifies action to eliminate
evil and eradicate enemies.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Extreme Paranoia </i>– The belief of members that their movement is
under constant or imminent attack by outside forces can lead them to justify
violent action against perceived enemies.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
<i>Charismatic Leadership – </i>Although many<i> </i>extremist groups adhere
to a leaderless structure, the presence of a “prophetic” personality can
add to the potential for violence by an apocalyptic movement. Often such
a leader will portray himself as a prophet or messiah.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Absolute control over member’s beliefs</i> – Apocalyptic movements can
exhibit a dangerous control over the morality and inhibitions of their
movements. The creed of the movement takes the place of external belief
systems, thus insulating their members from the influence of broader social
constraints.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Moral and physical isolation</i> – An apocalyptic movement is demonstrably
more dangerous when its members live iphysical isolation from the surrounding
society. This isolation fosters and feeds off the belief on the part of
the movement’s followers that they are above the laws of society. The movement’s
own social code is established as the basis of all acceptable behavior.
It’s members operate in a social vacuum where there is a relative absence
of normal institutionalized restraints to curb their whims.</li>
</ul>

<dir>This isolation also increases the dependency of the movement’s members
on their leader and/or the social structure of the movement.</dir>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Arms acquisition</i> –Violence plays a major role in the ideology of
many apocalyptic movements. This, together with the paranoia and xenophobia
can cause a movement to live in expectation of violent conflict with outside
forces. Such a belief generally leads to the hoarding of arms and preparation
of defensive arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cults: A Different Focus</b>
<p>By contrast to the trend toward the unstructured, non-hierarchical,
leaderless structure of many newer terrorist groups, cults retain a rigidly
hierarchical structure, based upon a charismatic leader. For this reason,
counter-terrorism efforts must put great emphasis on understanding the
leader, his background, his worldview and his plans for the future.
<p>Project Megiddo listed the principle signs that law enforcement officials
need to watch for in a cult and its leader to determine whether the cult
had the potential for carrying out millennium violence:
<ul><li>Sequestered Groups </i>– Members of sequestered groups lose access
to the outside world and information preventing critical evaluation of
the ideas being espoused by the leader.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Leader’s History </i>– The fantasies, dreams, plans, and ideas
of the leader are most likely to become the beliefs of the followers because
of the totalitarian and authoritarian nature of cults.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Psychopaths </i>– Control of a group by charismatic psychopaths
or those with narcissistic character disorders.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Changes in the Leader </i>– Changes in a leader’s personality caused
by traumatic events such as death of a spouse or sickness.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Language of the Ideology </i>– Groups that are violent use language
in their ideology that contains the seeds of violence.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Implied Directive for Violence </i>– Most frequently, a leader’s
speeches, rhetoric, and language does not explicitly call for violence,
rather it is most often only implied.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Length of Time </i>– The longer the leader’s behavior has gone
unchecked against outside authority, the less vulnerable the leader feels.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Who is in the Inner Circle </i>– Cults with violent tendencies
often recruit people who are either familiar with weapons or who have military
backgrounds to serve as enforcers.</li></ul>
<p>The following Table sums up the danger signs for both types of apocalyptic
movement.

<p><a NAME="window"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>A Window of
Opportunity for Terrorists?</font></font></b>
<p><a NAME="y2k"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">The Y2K Bug and the Apocalypse</font></i></b>
<p>The Y2K phenomenon plays a major role in the conspiracy theories of
a number of worldviews. Some see the entire scenario of possible computer
shutdowns and technological chaos as being yet another tool for the manipulation
of the unwary masses, who have purposely been kept in the dark by their
governments. Others see the entire Y2K phenomenon as being a tremendous
hoax perpetrated by governments bent on sowing panic in their populations,
the better to gain supreme control of fringe elements and militias.
<p>Such groups are likely to view any power outages or computer malfunctions
as proof of their conspiracy theories. Neil Gallagher, head of the FBI’s
national security division said that one danger was that conspiracy theorists
would misinterpret any system failures “as a sign that in fact the New
World Order is beginning.” John Trochmann, leader of the Militia of Montana,
foresees terrorist attacks around the country if computers fail and utilities
break down.
<p>James G. “Bo” Gritz, once a decorated Army colonel in the Green Berets,
now deep in the militant Patriot movement, toured the country this year
cautioning that Washington is planning Y2K problems to allow a global organization
to take over America.
<p>But while some see the Y2K bug as a mere government ploy or catalyst,
there are others who see in the phenomenon something more; they view Y2K
as a window of opportunity. There is every possibility that terrorists
will take advantage of any minor breakdowns to advance their own agenda.
<p><a NAME="domestic"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Domestic Terrorism</font></i></b>
<p>The approaching millennium has confronted a number of countries with
an increased threat of terrorism on the part of anti-government groups
within their borders. Such threats tend to come from two main types of
organization: religious extremists, who see the millennium as the onset
of the “End Times,” and secular right-wing groups, based on various conspiracy
theories.
<p>In the United States, for example, organizations of the second type
style themselves “Patriot groups,” and share a common goal of overthrowing
the American government. American law enforcement officials estimate that
there are nearly 1,000 cults and more than 500 hate groups. Of the latter,
many are quite well-armed.
<p>While some domestic groups are believed to have the potential for violence,
they generally confine their activities to their countries of origin and
for the most part are not expected to cross international boundaries. The
FBI report cautioned that power outages or other problems associated with
the Y2K bug could be interpreted by American apocalyptic movements as a
sign of the impending UN take-over, and could spur their members to take
action against what they see as an immediate threat.
<p><b>Case in Point: The Sacramento bomb plot</b>
<p>During the first week of December, U.S. Federal agents arrested two
anti-government militia members who were reportedly planning to blow up
a Sacramento, Calif., propane plant, possibly around New Year’s Eve. The
authorities believe the plot was designed to exploit Y2K fears among the
nation’s hate groups.
<p>A threat assessment report by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory concluded that a successful attack on either tank
“would likely result in a firestorm that could reach as far out as 14 kilometers
from the site and could cause a fatality rate as high as 50 percent up
to five miles away.”
<p>U.S. law enforcement officials said the two were planning to commit
terrorist acts against multiple targets in northern California, including
television and radio towers, in an attempt to prompt a declaration of martial
law. They apparently hoped that the ensuing civic unrest would ultimately
pave the way for a militia takeover of the federal government.
<p>An FBI affidavit said “It was further believed that if the government
declares martial law, the militia will develop a public following and the
current United States government will be overthrown by revolution.” Both
men were previously involved with the San Joaquin County Militia, which
authorities said planned to use violence to bring about martial law in
the belief that this would help the group attract a public following to
launch a revolution to overthrow the U.S. government.
<p>In general the threat of domestic terrorism to Muslim countries arises
not from any significance of the millennium to local countries, but from
the possibility that internal terrorist groups may exploit any problems
arising from the Y2K bug to advance their own agenda. In several countries
in the Middle East, the greater danger as far as domestic terrorism involves
religious extremist groups, which may step up their attempts to overthrow
secular governments in favor oftheocracies.
<p><a NAME="international"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">International Terrorism</font></i></b>
<p>While many Millennial groups confine themselves to changing the established
order in their own countries, the majority also express rather sharply
defined beliefs about the relationship of events in their own countries
to those on the international scene. In this sense the Millenium has served
to refocus the interests of some millennial groups from local to global
happenings. In fact, it is the onset of the Millenium that has in many
cases lent an air of internationalism to what would otherwise be a rather
insular worldview.
<p>Thus even the domestic groups may constitute a threat on the international
scene, should they feel the need to re-write events on the world stage
to suit their own views of what “ought” to transpire. Of particular importance
here are the groups based on a religious or apocalyptic worldview. Such
groups are by their very nature, concerned with events in countries other
than their country of origin. Many express very particular views on the
abrupt changes about to take place on the world stage with the onset of
the Millenium, and see themselves as catalysts for the chaos and upheaval
that will be necessary to bring about such change.
<p><b>Ossama bin Ladin</b>
<p>Of all the possible security threats during the millennium one of the
names most often mentioned is that of Ossama bin Ladin. The exiled Saudi
dissident is accused of masterminding a host of indiscriminate attacks
over the past 15 years, among them the August, 1998 bombing of the American
embassies in East Africa. Security forces in several Middle Eastern countries
have launched an unprecedented campaign to thwart possible attacks by bin
Ladin’s widespread network.
<p>With the latest wave of arrests of potential terrorists the level of
cooperation between American and Middle Eastern security forces has reached
a new high. In the majority of cases, those arrested were said to have
links to Osama bin Ladin and his Al-Qaidah network.
<p>In the U.S. and Canada authorities are attempting to unravel the chain
of events that lead an Algerian to attempt to smuggle a truckfull of bomb-making
materials into Washington State from Canada. Ahmed Ressam was arrested
after he allegedly boarded a ferry to Port Angeles from Victoria, British
Columbia. Ressan had been turned down for refugee status in Canada because
he was suspected of belonging to the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the Algerian
terrorist group held responsible for bombings in France and countless massacres
in their own country.
<p><b>Turkey and the Iranian connection</b>
<p>Turkey’s Counter-Terrorism units have been put on alert against possible
terrorist attacks several times over the past few months. In October security
forces captured several Islamic militants allegedly connected with al-Qaidah,
who attempted to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran. According to <i>Al-Watan
el-Arabi</i>, the interrogation of the militants revealed that a “commando
unit” affiliated with Osama bin Ladin had infiltrated into Turkey across
the Iranian border. The results of the interrogations prompted Turkish
intelligence to inform their counterparts in Europe of the possibility
of action by bin Ladin’s network in their countries.
<p>A Turkish intelligence report called attention to the statement of one
of the captured militants to the effect that the unit was trained by an
Iranian official from the city of Tevriz. Most of the unit’s members infiltrated
from Iran, while others entered Turkey by way of European countries, such
as Italy and Bosnia. The report said that two additional infiltrators were
still in Iran waiting to cross over into Turkey. According to the Turkish
report, the militants were financed by bin Ladin and infiltrated into Turkey
on his orders.
<p>The Turkish authorities said that six members of an eight member team
crossed into Turkey from Iran on 11 June, 1999 and are currently at large
somewhere in Turkey. The unit was said to include four Iranian Kurds and
two Algerians, all of whom were carrying forged passports. An Egyptian
Islamist in exile confirmed that such a manhunt was underway, but insisted
that the suspects were in no way affiliated with bin Ladin. He was speaking
to the Arabic-language paper <i>Al-Hayyat</i>.
<p>On December 6, Turkish police detained six Libyans suspected of planning
an attack against American diplomatic targets. According to the Turkish
media, security forces received intelligence information that a terrorist
cell affiliated with Osama bin Ladin had infiltrated into Turkey. They
were reportedly planning an attack on the American embassy in Ankara. The
suspects, who claim to be Libyan dissidents, were charged with traveling
on false passports and possession of forgery materials.
<p><b>Arrests in Jordan</b>
<p>On December 15, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Raouf al-Rawabdeh announced
that Jordanian security forces had arrested a group of eleven Jordanian
nationals, an Iraqi and an Algerian on suspicion of planning terrorist
attacks.
<p>Jordanian officials said the group was plotting attacks on Christian
pilgrimage sites in the Hashemite kingdom. Three suspects were still being
sought outside of Jordan. A Jordanian official was quoted by AFP as saying,
“The ring that was smashed was funded in particular by Omar Abu Omar, also
known as Abu Qatadah, who is a right-hand man of Osama bin Laden.”
<p>Omar Mahmoud Abu Omar is well known to Jordanian security forces. In
1998 he was sentenced <i>in absentia</i> for his part in a series of bomb
blasts in Amman at the beginning of 1998, one of which targeted the former
official of Jordanian military intelligence.
<p>Abu Omar was the ideologue of a group known as “The movement of reform
and challenge” (<i>Harakat al-Islah wal-Tahaddi</i>). He was granted political
asylum in the UK. In the last few years Abu Omar served as one of the editors
of “Al-Ansar,” the official publication of GIA. He published his radical
Islamic ideas in a book Between two Methods (<i>Bayn al-Minhajayn</i>).
<p>The leader of the Afghan-trained group was identified as Khader Abu
Ghoshah. In 1993 Abu Ghoshah was sentence to a jail term in Jordan for
several bombings. He was released before his sentence was served out by
a royal pardon. From Jordan he traveled to Afghanistan, where, according
to Jordanian security forces, he was trained in explosives and bomb-making.
Abu Ghoshah formed a group called Jaish Mohammed (the army of Mohammed),
comprising veterans of the Afghan conflict. Jordanian officials say the
group wbehind some of the bombings last year in the Kingdom.
<p>The unnamed Jordanian source quoted by the AFP said that the security
forces had the Afghan group under surveillance shortly after they returned
to Jordan, but waited to make arrests until all its members could be detained.
The clampdown came on December 5, after the last members of the group,
most of whom traveled on false passports, were once more back in the country.
<p>The arrests were linked to an American travel warning to its citizens
traveling abroad that terrorists could be seeking to target Americans.
The travel warning cited “credible evidence that terrorists are planning
attacks specifically targeting American citizens” over the New Year, which
this year coincides with the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
<p>On 13 October, a man reported to be an aide to Ossama bin Ladin, Mahrez
Hamduni was apprehended at Istanbul’s international airport during the
course of a police action in which Interpol was also involved. He was said
to be carrying a Bosnian passport. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, a man called
Khalil al-Deek, also known as Abu Ayed was arrested on suspicion of having
close ties with bin Ladin. Al-Deek, an American-Jordanian who holds a US
passport was extradited to Jordan on December 16<sup>th</sup> at the request
of the Jordanian authorities.
<p>Senior Afghani sources told Al-Hayyat that the arrest of Hamduni may
be connected to the arrest of a suspected “Western spy.” A young Jordanian
man, identified as Abu al-Mubtasim was arrested by the Taliban on suspicion
of providing information on the movements of Osama bin Ladin’s network
to “a foreign country.”
<p>The arrests of bin Ladin’s operatives following to the bombing in Kenya
and Tanzania in August 1998 are indicative of the extent of his organization’s
international infrastructure. At the same time, the potential threat has
increased the degree of international counter-terrorist cooperation to
a level unheard of in previous years. The recent arrests are an encouraging
sign that the international community has so far proven equal to the challenge
presented by bin Ladin’s network.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="jerusalem"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">Jerusalem and the Apocalypse</font></i></b>
<p>A great deal of emotional and religious ardor centers around Jerusalem,
and more specifically around the Temple Mount, a piece of real estate a
few square kilometers in area.
<p>This site is sacred to three religions. For the Jews it is where the
First and Second Temples stood in biblical times, for Muslims it is where
Mohammed ascended to heaven. The el-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock,
which stand where the Temple once stood mark the third holiest site in
Islam. Many Christians believe that the Second Coming will take place on
the Temple Mount, and possibly concomitant with the building of the Third
Temple.
<p>But of course the Temple cannot be rebuilt while the Muslim shrines
still stand. So the threat is actually three-fold, as it isn’t only the
Christian apocalyptic groups that attach special meaning to the Temple
Mount and the millennium. Radical Jewish groups too could attempt to take
some action aimed at laying the foundation for the building of the Third
Temple. If such a group perpetrated a symbolic attack against the Muslim
holy places, this could set in motion a chain of events leading to war.
Muslim groups in turn, might take action to prevent what they perceive
as a threat against the Dome of the Rock and el-Aqsa.
<p>Yet another millennium-related complication is what is known in psychiatric
circles as the “Jerusalem syndrome,” a belief that one is destined to play
a key role in the apocalypse. In extreme cases, a sufferer actually comes
to believe that he is the Messiah. Jerusalem mental health commissioner
Yair Bar-el warned that of the four million Christians expected to visit
the country in 2000 some could suffer from religious delusions and could
become dangerous.
<p><b>Deportations &amp; dilemmas</b>
<p>In consultation with American and European security officials, Israel
is seeking to stave off possible violence on the part of religious groups
and right-wing extremists who place particular importance on the turn of
the millennium as a sign of massive social changes.
<p>In Israel police are on the lookout in particular for Christian “doomsday”
cults, which may seek to induce mayhem in Jerusalem as a precondition for
the Second Coming of Christ. Members of such cults have already entered
Israel, according to American and Israeli sources. Last January Israel
deported 14 members of a Denver-based culled called Concerned Christians.
In 1996, the cult’s leader Monte Kim Miller told his followers that he
would be a “witness,” who would announce the Second Coming. He sent a number
of cult members to Israel in the next few years, saying that he would be
murdered on the streets of Jerusalem in December 1999, and be resurrected
three days later.
<p>On October 25 Israeli authorities expelled 20 members of two Christian
groups--called Solomon’s Temple and the House of Prayer, most of them Americans.
The cultist lived in two groups on the Mount of Olives across from the
Old City of Jerusalem, where, according to Christian belief, Jesus will
arrive to mark the Second Coming. Israeli authorities said they suspected
the groups of planning a mass suicide on the Temple Mount. They were also
suspected of planning an attack on the Temple Mount, an act designed to
lead to the “war of Armageddon,” which was to presage the redemption.
<p>The last member of the group, the leader of the House of Prayer, called
Brother David was deported to the United States on 5 November. For years
his identity had been a mystery. Finally, with the help of the FBI, Israeli
authorities identified him as David William Gardner a former trailer park
manager from Syracuse, N.Y. Gardner arrived in Israel in May 1982, and
apparently destroyed his passport and other documents.
<p>Two weeks prior to this another Christian group was turned away by Israel
port police following intelligence information that members of the group
were planning to commit mass suicide in Jerusalem. The group eventually
returned to Greece, the country from which they had sailed to Israel.
<p>Israeli police believe that many more cult members have arrived in Israel
and are hiding in areas under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority.
Israeli sources said they hope for cooperation with the Palestinian police
in keeping tabs on suspected millennial groups. For the most part, intelligence
on these groups comes from the authorities in their home countries working
with their Israeli counterparts.
<p>There have been fears that the crackdown on religious extremists could
deter some moderate Christian groups from visiting Israel during the millennium.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron has said that Israel is making a
determined effort to distinguish between the Christians who visit Israel
for sincere religious reasons and those who are members of potentially
violent cults. Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak admitted that police
could make mistakes, but said his first priority is safety for the tourists
and the holy sites. For Israeli law enforcement officials the operative
phrase seems to be “better safe than sorry.”
<p><a NAME="Conclusion"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Conclusion</font></font></b>
<p>The millennium is a historic milestone for people from a broad spectrum
of belief. Its significance lies in its symbolic nature, and in the fact
that followers of apocalyptic worldviews may interpret the mundane events
associated with the turn of the millennium as portents of the fulfillment
of their own particular prophecies. Thus, a religious system that predicts
chaos and upheaval at the onset of the End Times may interpret minor computer
glitches associated with the Y2K bug as a sign that the end of the world
is at hand. It is this perception that could conceivably cause some group’s
to cross the line from the harmlessly eccentric to the actively violent.
<p>Not all apocalyptic groups are motivated by religious extremism. Some
are founded on right-wing or racial ideologies. The FBI’s “Project Megiddo”
outlined some of the chief dangers from fringe groups on or around the
change of the millennium. Among these are groups that believe in the “New
World Order” conspiracy—the idea that the UN will attempt to take over
the world at the turn of the millennium and set up a “One World Government.”
This belief is sometimes combined with apocalyptic Christian belief that
such a united world government will be established by the Antichrist, and
will be overthrown at the Second Coming of Christ.
<p>An added danger may come from groups fervently awaiting the fulfillment
of their prophecies, when the date for fulfillment passes by with no results.
Dissapointment could spur believers to seek out scapegoats to explain the
failure of the prophecies to come true.
<p>Regardless of ideological motivation, the coming millennium presents
unprecedented challenges to counter-terrorism worldwide. These challenges
are not confined to the period surrounding January 1, but can be expected
to continue for some time into the coming year.
