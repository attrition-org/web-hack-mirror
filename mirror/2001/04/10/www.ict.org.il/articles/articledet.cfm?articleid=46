<P><B>The Rationale - from political rivalry to religious conflict</B>
<BR>The recent “war” between the USA and the Islamist [<A HREF="#notes">1</A>]
followers of Osama ibn Laden, has brought to light a problem that has been
facing the Western world for several years, but which it preferred, for
various reasons, to ignore. To begin with the terrorist activity of Islamic
radical groups<FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>in a number of places around the world--and
not only in the Middle East--has, since the early 1980s, been aimed primarily
at the United States. In addition, the decline of the Soviet Union (1990-1991)
seems to have forced the Western world to seek out for a new enemy. These
two trends converged during the 1990s with the growth of an aura of global
conflict between socio-political cultures: Islam and the Muslim world versus
America as the leading element of Western culture.

<P>These perceptions harmonized with the views of radical Islam developed
since WWII, in the wake of the creation of the so-called Third World and
growing independence of underdeveloped countries. The permanent conflict
in the Middle East and its prominent role in the Cold War gave Islamic
radicals an excellent opportunity to further expand this theme of an eternal
global rivalry between the main cultures of the world. Since 1948 they
have seen in the Jews--as partners and allies of the new “crusaders” in
the West--a new villain in the global conspiracy against Islam as a culture
and religion, and against the Muslim nation in general.

<P><B>The Need for an Enemy</B>
<BR>The problem of the Western world--even more relevant today--is how
to refrain from a rivalry that wears the guise of a war of religions between
Islam and Western culture. The modern culture of the West--combining elements
of democracy, human rights, civil infrastructure, liberalism etc., with
the social and human values of Christianity-- seems to view the phrase
“Islamic Terrorism” as politically incorrect.

<P>Western man would prefer to believe that there is no problem between
him and the general Muslim population or most of it, but only between him
and certain marginal groups, which have no real support, sympathy or allies
in their homelands.

<P>On the other hand, Muslim perceptions increasingly see the West as an
enemy, not necessarily for religious reasons but for socio-economic ones.
The problems stems from a variety of causes: the growing hatred of the
wealthy Western countries; the growing alienation of different factions
of societies from one another; together with the burst of nationalistic
disputes and open conflicts after the fall of the Soviet Union. All this
has resulted in a sense of global cultural conflict between the USA--the
sole leader of the West--and the rest of the so-called Third World, of
which the Muslims are the greater part. This sense of conflict brought
with it a growing “solidarity of the poor,” cemented by religious ties.
And this in turn gave rise to the feeling that an American or Western attack
on any Muslim country or internal group constitutes an attack on the whole
of the Muslim world. This solidarity is based also on the Islamist view
that the unification of the Muslim world is their primary mission in the
world. It is this cohesion that causes governments under threat of internal
terrorism on a religious basis to join the general choir of condemnations
of the West under the flag of artificial solidarity promoted by terrorists
or radical and fundamentalist groups.

<P>The West too is in need of an enemy. The absence of the USSR as an enemy
or rival for the West seems to contribute also to this problem. Again--though
not necessarily on a religious basis--Western society needs “someone to
hate”--someone who will embody in vivid colors the eternal rivalry between
God and the Devil, good and evil. Terrorism in general, and that of Islamic
radical groups in particular, is perfect for the role, seeming as it does
to threaten the most important elements of life in the modern Western world--peace
and security.

<P>In short, both sides have developed a sense of conflict between sworn
enemies, with each more demonic in the eyes of the other. The veneer of
religion causes them both to stick more firmly to their positions, in mirroring
the eternal war between good and evil, light and darkness, which is deeply
rooted in their religions.

<P>What then is the root of the problem?

<P>The real problem lies in the ambivalence--perhaps even hypocrisy--of
the West, which is frightened by the very thought of being perceived as
party to a religious war--a notion so old fashioned, un-liberal, politically
incorrect and possibly frightening. Its leaders tend to bury their heads
in the sand, ignoring very important processes taking place in the Muslim
world in recent years.

<P>The fear of using the phrase “Islamic Terrorism” seems to represent
one of the weaker elements of Western counter-terrorism.

<P><B>The Islamic perceptions of the global war</B>
<BR>One of the Islamic radical movements’ greatest successes in the past
three decades is their ability to present themselves to a large Muslim
public all over the Arab and Muslim world as the bearers of true Islam,
emphasizing those socio-political elements that attract the majority of
the population. They appeal to the lower classes of society, who are seeking
messianic solutions to their hopeless situation, by emphasizing the more
political elements of Islam and the human values such as social justice.
In addition, they have something to offer the intellectuals of the middle
class, who seek democracy, human rights and civil infrastructure but are
disappointed with the “imported” ideologies and forms of government--including
socialism, liberal nationalism, fascism and communism and military dictatorships--as
applied in the Arab world.

<P>In conservative populations religion--particularly Islam--and men of
religion, are highly regarded and have a good deal of respect and influence.
One of the basic tenents of Islam is the division of the world into two
defined parts in perpetual conflict--the world of Islam (<I>Dar al-Islam)
</I>and the world of heresy (<I>Dar al-Harb). </I>Thus, the perception
of global conflict is deeply rooted in Muslim society. Furthermore, these
perceptions were strengthened and enhanced before the Islamic radical revival
by similar ideas developed under national, socialist or secular regimes,
which had viewed the West as colonialist and imperialist. However, the
basic hatred to the wealthy West under American hegemony has only taken
a religious guise in the last three decades. The elementary perceptions
of the Arab world fighting the Crusaders were an integral part of the ideology
of Gamal `Abd al-Nasser and the leaders of the Syrian Ba`th party long
before the present Islamic expansion in the Arab world.

<P>The Islamists--whether ruled by the elementary doctrines of the Muslim
Brotherhood, or by the ideology developed by Sayyed Qutb, father of some
of the modern Jihad groups--have always sought for global missions: the
revival of the former Muslim empire, the unification of the Muslim world
as one nation, and the reclamation of Islamic glory. All of these missions
are based on a view unique to Islam, that religion is an integral part
of politics and vise versa. There is a conflict of giants and Islam or
the Muslim world is destined by Allah the almighty to win.

<P>However, for the past few centuries of Muslim history, the West has
had the upper hand over the Muslims and therefore some explanation for
this is required. On the other hand the Islamist revival through the various
movements, groups and ideological streams, had to plant in the general
public the sense that the Islamic victory is close at hand. For this purpose
two important perceptions were developed by the different movements, singularly
homogeneous in viewpoint. One was the hidden power of Islam in contrast
to the actual cowardliness and moral weakness of the West and its Jewish
allies. The other was the global conspiracy against Islam as a religion
and the Muslims as its adherents.

<P>The combination of these two perceptions led most of the radical Islamic
groups to the conclusion that they could win over the West in general or
over what they see as its leading moral and cultural elements--the Americans
and the Jews--by main force. As long as they were not governments or regimes,
and perceived most of the Arab regimes as part of the global conspiracy,
they looked for the soft belly of their enemy. Islamic Jihad thus departed
from the ways of conventional warfare between regular armies recruited
by a <I>Khalifah, </I>the politico-religious authority of the Muslim State--as
dictated by orthodox Islamic principles, and deteriorated instead into
a war of mere indiscriminate terrorism. And this terrorism is directed
against an enemy whose corrupt morals transformed him from a dreadful colonialist
into a “paper tiger.”

<P>In the eyes of the Islamist movements and ideologists, there is already
a state of war between the Muslim world and the Crusaders’ political culture.
From their viewpoint, members of Islamist groups are not terrorists, but
permanent soldiers in the service of Allah. As the enemy is everywhere,
not only in its own countries but also deep inside the Arab and Muslim
world in the form of corrupt governments and diseased cultures, the soldiers
of Allah must wage a constant war on many fronts. And as the conspiracy
is against Islam and the Muslims, their war is actually one of self-defense.
Just as the infidels fight using contemptible and foul methods, the Islamic
answer should use all possible means of defense--including indiscriminate
terrorism.

<P><B>The popular legitimacy of Islamic Terrorism</B>
<BR>The various Islamist radical groups have emerged outside of the Islamic
establishments in the Arab or Muslim world. The later, being appointed
and controlled by secular regimes, are perceived as subordinate to their
masters, “the clerics of the regime” (<I>‘Ulama` al-Salatin</I>). Their
religious rulings (<I>Fatawa</I>) were often denied, especially those dealing
with cultural and socio-political issues. Various Islamist groups have
their own clerics and religious rulings. Some of these rulings are given
by ideological or political leaders who lack any official religious education
and who issue far-reaching commentary of Islamic principles. They have
therefore, no problem in forcing their views on their adherents, who view
their ideology and doctrines as an integral part of true religion.

<P>But, the main success or failure of these terrorist groups does not
depend on their religious commentary or authority. It lies in their ability
to gain legitimacy from the general public or from the greater part of
it in each Muslim country, as well as in the Arab world in a whole. The
need for public sympathy and support is a crucial element of every terrorist
group without regard to its ideology or political affiliation. However,
in a society where religion has so great an influence as in the Arab and
Muslim world, the teachings of Islamist groups are perceived by certain
parts of society as the true principles of religion. The socio-cultural
elements of their teachings are often combined with the “secular” tradition
of hostility toward the West under American hegemony and/or toward its
protection of Israel and the Jews, who are according to the Quran: “The
worst enemies of the believers.” [<A HREF="#notes">2</A>]

<P>This popular support for various Islamist terrorist groups in many parts
of the Arab and Muslim world, increases the solidarity of a large public
with the sense of conflict with the West and with the United States. This
accord supplies popular legitimacy to indiscriminate terrorism in the cover
of a religious duty of Jihad. This phenomenon from time to time affects
not only the general public but certain governments as well. The American
strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan was not perceived by Arab governments,
at least in their public reactions, as part of legitimate counter-terrorism,
but as an unjustified aggression. Condemnations of the United States were
heard in various degrees from the entire Arab world, including those normally
regarded as moderate, such as Egypt and Jordan, not to mention the Gulf
states. Certain forms of terrorism as “the weapon of the poor” are regarded
by both peoples and governments as self defense, while the American attacks
are considered “war crimes.”

<P>So long as Islamic fundamentalism and radicalism have popular support--whether
in the form of ideology or in the form of movements and organizations--its
influence over large parts of the Muslim world gives it the legitimacy
to wage a war that is perceived as between the West and the Islamic world.
Arab and Muslim governments will not attempt to delegitimize those movements
until they begin to threaten the regimes themselves. In fact, governments
often join, either publicly or privately, in promoting the notion of hostility
to the West disseminated by the radical Islamic movements or groups--hostility
that provides the soil in which the seeds of terrorism in the name of Islamic
Jihad may grow.

<P>In addition to the foregoing, the West in general and the United States
in particular, should take into consideration that in various forms there
already exist several Muslim regimes that promote Islamic radicalism and
support Islamic terrorism: Iran, Afghanistan under the Taliban rule, the
Sudan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The last has shown in the last year increasing
qualms about assisting the United States in fighting terrorism against
American targets on Saudi territory, for example, in Dhahran and Riyadh.
Some of these states were and are state-sponsors of terrorism.

<P>The USA and its Western allies confront not only Osama ibn Laden and
his partners from the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al-Gama`at al-Islamiyah.
They must not regard their Islamist enemies as marginal groups in the Muslim
world. They actually confront large portions of the Islamic world, whose
backing for the “marginal” groups give them the public legitimacy to promote
their terrorist activity.

<P><B>In Conclusion</B>
<BR>There is an Islamic terrorism based on socio-religious perceptions.
It may not include the whole Arab and Muslim world, but it perceives the
terrorism it wages against the West as an integral part of its religion.
The West in general and the USA in particular cannot ignore it and should
therefore unite their efforts in an attempt to find different means of
countering this kind of Islamic terrorism.

<P>The West should learn from one of the best students of Islamic fundamentalism
and radicalism, the Dutch scholar, Prof. Johannes Jansen:
<BLOCKQUOTE>“In a fiercely competitive society the dominant religion may
preach that the greatest virtue is to love one’s neighbor. The religion
of a group which over the centuries has become marginalised may, on the
other hand, preach that God has exclusively and explicitly chosen those
who follow his commandments. This group may come to believe that it plays
a central role in the history of God and his creation. In a society where
the law is not much more than an interesting but highly theoretical matter,
the major religion may proclaim that following God’s laws is the only way
to put things right. . . Islamic fundamentalism is both politics and religion.
It has a dual nature. When it is analyzed as if it were a movement that
has political nature only, mistakes are made because fundamentalism is
fully religion at the same time.” [<A HREF="#notes">3</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the Islamic world one cannot differentiate between the political violence
of Islamic groups and their popular support derived from religion. They,
at any rate, do not recognize any disparity.

<P>The important question remains as to how the West should defend itself
against Islamic terrorism. To address the question would require another
article. Suffice it to say that in order to deal with this problem, the
West must first recognize that the present terrorism on the part of the
Arab and Muslim world is Islamic in nature.

The term “Islamist” is often used by Islamic radical groups and scholars
of the Islamic revival, to emphasize the distinction between orthodox Islamic
groups and movements that follow orthodox Islam, and radical or fundamental
groups. It also serves the claim of many Muslims and Muslim organizations
that the phenomenon of these radical or extremist groups does not represent true
Islam but stems from a misinterpretation of the religion, and even heresy. They also
claim that Islam cannot be used for terrorist activity because of its peaceful
elements.</LI>
