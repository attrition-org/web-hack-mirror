<p><center><h2>Suicide Terrorism: an Overview</h2></center>
<P><b>Boaz Ganor</b>

<P><font size="-1"></font>

<p><p>Over the past decade, several countries all over the world have been
forced to contend with the phenomenon of suicide attacks. Radical activists
from such diverse countries as Turkey, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, as well as Palestinians
have elected to use suicide as a weapon in terrorist attacks aimed at various
targets—both civilian and military—where large crowds tend to gather.
<p>Suicide attacks constitute an additional stage in the escalation of
terrorist activity, with the clear intention of causing the maximum number
of casualties and damage—even more importantly—of striking a blow to public
morale.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="90%">
<p><b><font size=+1>What is a suicide attack?</font></b>
<br>A suicide attack is an “operational method in which the very act of
the attack is dependent upon the death of the perpetrator.” The terrorist
is fully aware that if he does not kill himself, the planned attack will
not be implemented. The attack is carried out by activating explosives
worn or carried by the terrorist in the form of a portable explosive charge,
or planted in a vehicle he is driving.
<p>It is important to correctly define a suicide attack, for there are
different types of attacks, which may be mistakenly considered as belonging
to this special category:
<p>On many occasions, the perpetrator of an attack sets out with the knowledge
that there is a good chance of being killed in the course of an attack
(for example in trying to force a bus over a cliff). In spite of the imminent
danger to the terrorist’s life, as long as there is a possibility of the
attack being carried out without him being forced to kill himself during
the course of it, this <i>should</i> not considered to be “ a suicide attack.”
<p>Sometimes the terrorist makes concrete preparations for the possibility
of death as a result of the attack (preparing a will, carrying out purification
ceremonies, etc.). However, these preparations in themselves do not turn
the attack into a suicide attack.
<p>In some attacks, the terrorists are equipped with arms or explosives
for blowing themselves up should the attack go wrong, (For example if the
attack fails, or security forces break into a building where terrorists
are holding hostages). The existence of such arms or explosives—and even
the decision use them—does not constitute adequate grounds for the attack
to be defined as a suicide attack.
<p>As mentioned above, in a true suicide attack, the terrorist knows full
well that the attack will not be executed if he is not killed in the process.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="90%">
<p><font size=+1>What are the benefits of the suicide attack for the terrorist
organization?</font>
<br>Suicide attacks are attractive to terrorist organizations, as they
offer them a variety of advantages:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Suicide attacks result in many casualties and cause extensive damage.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Suicide attacks attract wide media coverage. A suicide attack is a newsworthy
event for the media as it indicates a display of great determination and
inclination for self-sacrifice on the part of the terrorists.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Although a suicide attack is a very primitive and simple attack,<i> </i>the
use of suicide tactics guarantees that the attack will be carried out at
the most appropriate time and place with regard to the circumstances at
the target location. This guarantees the maximum number of casualties (in
contrast to the use of technical means such as a time bomb or even a remote
controlled explosive charge). In this regard the suicide bomber is no more
than a sophisticated bomb—a carrier that brings the explosive device to
the right location and detonates it at the right time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In a suicide attack, as soon as the terrorist has set off on his mission
his success is virtually guaranteed. It is extremely difficult to counter
suicide attacks once the terrorist is on his way to the target; even if
the security forces do succeed in stopping him before he reaches the intended
target, he can still activate the charge and cause damage. (Thus the need
for accurate intelligence concerning the plans of the terrorist organizations
is crucial).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Planning and executing the escape route after a terror attack has occurred
is usually one of the most complicated and problematic stages of any terrorist
attack. Suicide attacks require no escape plan.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Since the perpetrator is killed during the course of the suicide attack,
there is no fear of him being caught afterwards, being interrogated by
the security forces and passing on information liable to endanger other
activists.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="90%">
<p><font size=+1>What are the benefits for the perpetrator of the suicide
attack?</font>
<br>Suicide attacks are considered attractive by groups of religious and
nationalistic fanatics who regard them as a kind of “Holy War” and a divine
command. The phenomenon has seen a growing popularity especially among
Islamist fundamentalist terror groups. Here we will focus on the Hamas,
an organization that has carried out a number of suicide attacks against
Israeli buses, markets and other civilian targets.
<p>For Hamas, the perpetrator of the suicide attack is not considered either
by himself or by other activists to have committed suicide. He is rather
perceived to be a “shahid”— a martyr who fell in the process of fulfilling
a religious command, the “Jihad” or “Holy War.” (Thus his act is called
in Arabic <i>Istishhad</i>).
<p>Suicide attacks may provide the shahid and his families with substantial
rewards:
<ul>
<li>
The majority of the shahids come from a low social status background. The
shahid improves his social status after their death as well as that of
his families.</li>

<li>
The family of the shahid is showered with honor and praise, and receives
financial rewards for the attack (usually <i>some thousands of </i>dollars).</li>
</ul>
In addition to the religious mission and the family rewards, the shahid
also receives some personal benefits (according to his belief), including:
<ul>
<li>
Eternal life in paradise,</li>

<li>
The permission to see the face of Allah,</li>

<li>
And the loving kindness of 72 young virgins who will serve him in heaven.</li>

<li>
The shahid also earns a privilege to promise a life in heaven to 70 of
his relatives.</li>
</ul>
The will of Hisham Ismail Abd-El Rahman Hamed (a suicide attacker who blew
himself up in November 1994 at Nezarim, killing 3 IDF officers and wounding
2 Israelis and 4 Palestinians), reflects the state of mind of the shahid
at the time of the attack. He wrote:
<blockquote>Dear family and friends! I write this will with tears in my
eyes and sadness in my heart. I want to tell you that I am leaving and
ask for your forgiveness because I decided to see Alla’ today and this
meeting is by all means more important then staying alive on this earth….
(Maariv 13/11/94 p. 15)</blockquote>
Another suicide attacker – Salah Abed El Hamid Shaker, who blew himself
up with another shahid at Beit Lid in January ’95, killing 18 Israelis
and wounding 36, wrote in his will:
<dir>I am going to take revenge upon the sons of the monkeys and the pigs—the
Zionists infidels and the enemies of humanity. I am going to meet my holy
brother Hisham Hamed and my distinguished<font face="Miriam"> </font>teacher,
Hani El Abed and all other Shahids and saints in paradise. Please Forgive
me.” (Maariv, 23/1/95)</dir>
All of these factors constitute a substantial incentive for fundamentalist
believers to adopt suicide attack tactics. When there are religious, nationalistic,
economic, social, and personal rewards for this kind of action, it is no
wonder that Hamas and Islamic Jihad find no difficulty in recruiting volunteers
for such missions.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="90%">
<p><font size=+1>Who is the shahid?</font>
<p>Again, focusing on suicide attacks carried out by Hamas against Israeli
targets, we can see a number common characteristics of the shahid which
serve as a basic profile of the suicide bomber. These include:
<ol>
<li>
Young—usually from18 to 27 years of age,</li>

<li>
Usually not married, unemployed and from a poor family.</li>

<li>
Usually the shahid completed high school,</li>

<li>
Most were devoted students in the Islamic fundamentalist education centers
in Gaza and in the West Bank directed and financed by Hamas.</li>

<li>
Some of the shahids arrested by Israel in the past have expressed the desire
to avenge the death or injury of a relative or a close friend at the hands
of Israel.</li>
</ol>
The reason for committing a suicide attack for most of the shahids is therefore
first and foremost religious fanaticism combined with nationalist extremism,
and a wish for revenge, but not personal despair.
<p>Usually a shahid does not volunteer for his missions. The shahid<i>
</i>may be selected by his Islamic religious teacher at the mosques and
Islamic education centers in Gaza and the West Bank. Usually the most devoted
students are selected after a close examination by the teachers and over
a long time of acquaintance. Sometimes the Shahid is picked by the planner
or the initiator of the attack on the basis of previous acquaintance.
<p>After the potential shahid is selected, he usually participates in long
training sessions in order to test his attitudes and performance under
pressure and in life-threatening situations. Only the trainees who are
both willing and cool-headed are permitted to move on to the next stage.
<p>Subsequently the shahid usually “disappears” from his home without farewell,
while he begins several days of intensive training in order to understand
all operational aspects of his mission and learn how to deal with the explosive
device. At this time the shahid also undergoes a process of physical and
mental purification.
<p>Some of the terrorists who were trained to be shahids testified that
at this stage they were taken to a graveyard and told to lie down inside
one of the graves for several hours in order to overcome the fear of death.
(<i>Yediot</i> 9/3/95), (<i>Maariv</i>, 24/3/97)
<p>On the last day before the attack the shahid is well trained, brain
washed, and willing and able to execute the suicide attack. At his point
he writes a will, in which he asks his family not to mourn him, because
he did not die but rather was transformed to another life in which he will
be with Allah. Also, he records a propaganda videocassette in which he
is disguised (usually by wearing an IDF uniform or typical Israeli clothes
and shaving his beard), he says a special prayer, and together with his
collaborators he drives to the target area.
<p>The shahid usually transports the explosive in a vehicle, sometimes
even by bicycle or cart. Alternately the device is hidden in a bag or in
a military vest under a coat.
<p>Standard explosives run to about 3-15 kilograms of TNT or <i>homemade</i>
explosives. In order to increase the damage small chunks of iron or a large
quantity of nails are often packed around the explosives. The detonator
is of a very simple design which allows the perpetrator to activate the
explosives at the proper time even when under pressure.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="90%">
<p><b><font size=+1>What can be done to fight suicide terrorism?</font></b>
<p>Terrorists use suicide attacks to instill a feeling of helplessness
in the population—the notion that they have no way of protecting themselves
against such attacks. These feelings strike a blow to public morale, creating
fear and panic.
<p>Any country faced with a struggle against this type of terrorism must
do its utmost to protect the population, and to provide them with a feeling
that “things can and will be done” against suicide attacks in order to
decrease the damage to the public morale.
<p>A state faced with suicide attacks must thwart these attacks through
intelligence, operational (counter-terrorist) measures, and protective
(anti-terrorist) measures. To these steps must be added psychological measures.
<p>Intelligence is the first link in the chain of thwarting any terror
attack, but is of the utmost importance in thwarting suicide attacks before
they are put into practice. The wave of suicide attacks in Israel in the<i>
</i>nineties reflects<i> </i>a decrease in Israeli intelligence capability
against the terrorist organizations.
<p><b>Operational (counter-terrorist) measures </b>– Since direct action
against the shahid himself is usually a complicated operation, operational<i>
</i>efforts should be diverted towards the application of pressure on those
elements involved in the overall planning and implementation of these attacks.
<p>Surrounding the shahid are several circles of activists, who are aware
in advance of the plan to execute a suicide attack.
<p>The first circle is the family. In many cases they notice a change in
the behavior of the shahid. In some cases the shahid has a brother or a
father <i>serving </i>in the Palestinian security services and this relative
could report to their commanders and prevent the attack.
<p>The second circle includes activists who initiate the attack, recruit
the terrorist, train him, and devise the explosive device, gather operational
intelligence on the target, and guide the shahid on his mission.
<p>The third circle is comprised of the collaborators, who give logistical
assistance to the shahid and the operational team, and drive the shahid
to the target.
<p>And the last circle is the supporters who approve these kinds of attacks
and create an atmosphere which makes it possible for the shahid and his
team to operate freely among them.
<p>The operational measures must focus simultaneausly on all of these circles
of activist.
<p><b><i>Security Measures</i> (anti-terrorist measures) </b>–<i> </i>Intelligence
and operational measures alone are not sufficient. New security methods
should be adopted, and action should be taken in order to prevent the Shahid
from reaching his target or getting inside the target.
<p>Even a shahid may be deterred, or at least his plans may be obstructed.
Increased protective measures and the exposure of the Shahid before he
has the opportunity to carry out the attack at the planned target, may
reduce the amount of damage caused by the Shahid and perhaps even prevent
the attack.
<p>The security measures are the last link in the chain of thwarting terror
attacks. But in the absence of sufficient intelligence or where the operational
capability against the terrorists is limited, the importance of this last
link in the chain becomes exceedingly high.
<p><b><i>Psychological Measures</i></b> - Another important facet of fighting
suicide attacks, as mentioned before, is countering the moral damage of
these attacks.
<p>Of foremost importance is the task of supporting and strengthening the
civilian population in dealing with suicide terrorism. It should be borne
in mind that the main victims of terrorism in general and suicide attacks
in particular are civilians, and it is they who are on the front line in
the fight against terrorism.
<p>States faced with suicide attacks must do whatever can be done to strengthen
the spirit of the people and their feeling of security, and thus convey
the message to the terrorists that these attacks do not serve their goals.
In this regard there must be cooperation between the administration, the
media, decision makers and politicians, security personnel and other sectors
which can work together to lessen the psychological damage of the suicide
attacks by means of propaganda and education.
<p>In summary, suicide attacks are the latest “fashion” in terrorism in
the Middle East and other countries worldwide. However, just as in the
past waves of terrorism waxed and waned, so too this wave of terrorism
will eventually die out.
<p>In contending with the phenomenon of suicide terrorism we should bear
in mind that the suicide attack is not an act of a lone lunatic or desperate
terrorist who decides to attack as an act of revenge. Rather it is a well-planned
terror attack, which demands extensive preparations and the involvement
of a number of activists and leaders.
<p>Therefore, countering this wave of terrorism requires a combination
of effective intelligence, operational activity, security and psychological
measures combined with international cooperation in the fight against the
organizations responsible for such attacks.
