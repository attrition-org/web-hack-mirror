<p><CENTER><B>THE CHARTER OF THE HAMAS(1)</B></CENTER>


<P>In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate

<P>"You are the best community that has been raised up for mankind. Ye
enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in Allah. And
if the People of the Scripture(2) had believed, it had been better for
them. Some of them are believers; but most of them are evil-doers.

<P>They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight against
you they will turn and flee. And afterward they will not be helped.

<P>Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save [where
they grasp] a rope from Allah and a rope from man.(3) They have incurred
anger from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because
they used to disbelieve the revelations of Allah, and slew the Prophets
wrongfully. That is because they were rebellious and used to transgress."
Surat Al-Imran (III), verses 109-111.(4)
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"Israel will rise and will remain erect until Islam eliminates it as
it had eliminated its predecessors."

<BR>May Allah Pity his Soul

<P>"The Islamic World is burning. It is incumbent upon each one of us to
pour some water, little as it may be, with a view of extinguishing as much
of the fire as he can, without awaiting action by the others." Sheikh Amjad

<P>In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>INTRODUCTION</B></CENTER>


<P>Grace to Allah, whose help we seek, whose forgiveness we beseech, whose
guidance we implore and on whom we rely. We pray and bid peace upon the
Messenger of Allah, his family, his companions, his followers and those
who spread his message and followed his tradition; they will last as long
as there exist Heaven and Earth.

<P>O, people!

<P>In the midst of misadventure, from the depth of suffering, from the
believing hearts and purified arms; aware of our duty and in response to
the decree of Allah, we direct our call(6), we rally together and join
each other. We educate in the path of Allah and we make our firm determination
prevail so as to take its proper role in life, to overcome all difficulties
and to cross all hurdles. Hence our permanent state of preparedness and
our readiness to sacrifice our souls and dearest [possessions] in the path
of Allah.

<P>Thus, our nucleus has formed which chartered its way in the tempestuous
ocean of creeds and hopes, desires and wishes, dangers and difficulties,
setbacks and challenges, both internal and external.

<P>When the thought matured, the seed grew and the plant took root in the
land of reality, detached from temporary emotion and unwelcome haste, the
Islamic Resistance Movement erupted in order to play its role in the path
of its Lord. In so doing, it joined its hands with those of all Jihad(7)
fighters for the purpose of liberating Palestine. The souls of its Jihad
fighters will encounter those of all Jihad fighters who have sacrificed
their lives in the land of Palestine since it was conquered(8) by the Companion(9)
of the Prophet, be Allah's prayer and peace upon him, and until this very
day. This is the Charter of the Islamic Resistance (Hamas) which will reveal
its face, unveil its identity, state its position, clarify its purpose,
discuss its hopes, call for support to its cause and reinforcement, and
for joining its ranks. For our struggle against the Jews is extremely wide-ranging
and grave, so much so that it will need all the loyal efforts we can wield,
to be followed by further steps and reinforced by successive battalions
from the multifarious Arab and Islamic world, until the enemies are defeated
and Allah's victory prevails. Thus we shall perceive them approaching in
the horizon, and this will be known before long:

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>KNOWING THE MOVEMENT</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Ideological Aspects</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article One</B>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement draws its guidelines from Islam; derives
from it its thinking, interpretations and views about existence, life and
humanity; refers back to it for its conduct; and is inspired by it in whatever
step it takes.

<P>The Link between Hamas and the Association of Muslim Brothers

<P><B>Article Two</B>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement is one of the wings of the Muslim Brothers
in Palestine. The Muslim Brotherhood Movement is a world organization,
the largest Islamic Movement in the modern era. It is characterized by
a profound understanding, by precise notions and by a complete comprehensiveness
of all concepts of Islam in all domains of life: views and beliefs, politics
and economics, education and society, jurisprudence and rule, indoctrination
and teaching, the arts and publications, the hidden and the evident, and
all the other domains of life.
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Structure and Essence</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Three</B>

<P>The basic structure of the Islamic Resistance Movement consists of Muslims
who are devoted to Allah and worship Him verily [as it is written]: 'I
have created Man and Devil for the purpose of their worship" [of Allah].
Those Muslims are cognizant of their duty towards themselves, their families
and country and they have been relying on Allah for all that.

<P>They have raised the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors in
order to extricate the country and the people from the [oppressors'] desecration,
filth and evil.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Nay, but we hurl the true against the false; and it does break
its head and lo! it vanishes" Sura 21 (the Prophets), verse 18.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B>Article Four</B>

<P>The Movement welcomes all Muslims who share its beliefs and thinking,
commit themselves to its course of action, keep its secrets and aspire
to join its ranks in order to carry out their duty. Allah will reward them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Dimensions of Time and Space of the Hamas</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Five</B>

<P>As the Movement adopts Islam as its way of life, its time dimension
extends back as far as the birth of the Islamic Message and of the Righteous
Ancestor. Its ultimate goal is Islam, the Prophet its model, the Quran
its Constitution. Its spacial dimension extends wherever on earth there
are Muslims, who adopt Islam as their way of life; thus, it penetrates
to the deepest reaches of the land and to the highest spheres of Heavens.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Seest you not how Allah coins a similitude: a goodly saying,
as a goodly tree, its root set firm, its branches reaching into heaven:
Giving its fruit at every season by permission of its Lord? Allah coins
the similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect." Sura 14 (Abraham),
verses 24-25.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Peculiarity and Independence</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Six</B>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement is a distinct Palestinian Movement which
owes its loyalty to Allah, derives from Islam its way of life and strives
to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine. Only under the
shadow of Islam could the members of all regions coexist in safety and
security for their lives, properties and rights(11). In the absence of
Islam, conflict arises, oppression reigns, corruption is rampant and struggles
and wars prevail. Allah had inspired the Muslim poet, Muhammed Iqbal(12),
when he said:

<P>When the Faith wanes, there is no security There is no this-worldliness
for those who have no faith Those who wish to live their life without religion
Have made annihilation the equivalent of life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Universality of Hamas</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Seven</B>

<P>By virtue of the distribution of Muslims, who pursue the cause of the
Hamas, all over the globe, and strive for its victory, for the reinforcement
of its positions and for the encouragement of its Jihad, the Movement is
a universal one. It is apt to be that due to the clarity of its thinking,
the nobility of its purpose and the loftiness of its objectives.

<P>It is in this light that the Movement has to be regarded, evaluated
and acknowledged. Whoever denigrates its worth, or avsupporting it, or
is so blind as to dismiss its role, is challenging Fate itself. Whoever
closes his eyes from seeing the facts, whether intentionally or not, will
wake up to find himself overtaken by events, and will find no excuses to
justify his position. Priority is reserved to the early comers.

<P>Oppressing those who are closest to you, is more of an agony to the
soul than the impact of an Indian sword.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And unto thee have we revealed the Scripture with the truth,
confirming whatever scripture was before it, and a watcher over it. So
judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their
desires away from the truth which has come unto thee. For each we have
appointed a divine law and a traced-out way. Had Allah willed, He could
have made you one community. But that He may try you by that which he has
given you [He has made you as you are]. So vie with one another in good
works. Unto Allah, you will all return. He will then inform you of that
wherein you differ." Sura V (the Table), verse 48.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Hamas is one of the links in the Chain of Jihad in the confrontation with
the Zionist invasion. It links up with the setting out of the Martyr Izz
a-din al-Qassam(13) and his brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood who fought
the Holy War in 1936; it further relates to another link of the Palestinian
Jihad and the Jihad and efforts of the Muslim Brothers during the 1948(14)
War, and to the Jihad operations of the Muslim Brothers in 1968(15) and
thereafter.

<P>But even if the links have become distant from each other, and even
if the obstacles erected by those who revolve in the Zionist orbit, aiming
at obstructing the road before the Jihad fighters, have rendered the pursuance
of Jihad impossible; nevertheless, the Hamas has been looking forward to
implement Allah's promise whatever time it might take. The prophet, prayer
and peace be upon him, said:

<P>The time(16) will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill
them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: 0 Muslim!
there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him! This will not apply
to the Gharqad(17), which is a Jewish tree (cited by Bukhari and Muslim)(18).
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Slogan of the Hamas</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Eight</B>

<P>Allah is its goal, the Prophet its model, the Quzan its Constitution,
Jihad its path and death for the case of Allah its most sublime belief.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>PART II</B></CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>OBJECTIVES</CENTER>


<P>Hamas finds itself at a period of time when Islam has waned away from
the reality of life. For this reason, the checks and balances have been
upset, concepts have become confused, and values have been transformed;
evil has prevailed, oppression and obscurity have reigned; cowards have
turned tigers, homelands have been usurped, people have been uprooted and
are wandering all over the globe. The state of truth has disappeared and
was replaced by the state of evil. Nothing has remained in its right place,
for when Islam is removed from the scene, everything changes. These are
the motives.

<P>As to the objectives: discarding the evil, crushing it and defeating
it, so that truth may prevail, homelands revert [to their owners], calls
for prayer be heard from their mosques, announcing the reinstitution of
the Muslim state. Thus, people and things will revert to their true place.
Allah is the one whose held we see,
<BLOCKQUOTE>"...And if Allah had not repelled some men by others the earth
would have been corrupted. But Allah is the Lord of kindness to [His] creatures."
Sura II (The Cow), verse 251.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B>Article Ten</B>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement, while breaking its own path, will do
its utmost to constitute at the same time a support to the weak, a defense
to all the oppressed. It will spare no effort to implement the truth and
abolish evil, in speech and in fact, both here and in any other location
where it can reach out and exert influence.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>PART III</B></CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>STRATEGIES AND METHODS</CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Strategy of Hamas: Palestine is an Islamic
Waqf(19)</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Eleven</B>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine
has been an Islamic Waqf throughout the generations and until the Day of
Resurrection, no one can renounce it or part of it, or abandon it or part
of it. No Arab country nor the aggregate of all Arab countries, and no
Arab King or President nor all of them in the aggregate, have that right,
nor has that right any organization or the aggregate of all organizations,
be they Palestinian or Arab, because Palestine is an Islamic Waqf throughout
all generations and to the Day or Resurrection. Who can presume to speak
for all Islamic generations to the Day of Resurrection? This is the status
[of the land] in Islamic Shari'a(20), and it is similar to all lands conquered
by Islam by force, and made thereby Waqf lands upon their conquest, for
all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. This [norm] has
prevailed since the commanders of the Muslim armies completed the conquest
of Syria and Iraq, and they asked the Caliph of Muslims, 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab(21).
for his view of the conquered land, whether it should be partitioned between
the troops or left in the possession of its population, or otherwise. Following
discussions and consultations between the Caliph of Islam, 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab,
and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, be peace and prayer upon
him, they decided that the land should remain in the hands of its owners
to benefit from it and from its wealth; but the control(22) of the land
and the land itself ought to be endowed as a Waqf [in perpetuity] for all
generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. The ownership of
the land by its owners is only one of usufruct, and this Waqf will endure
as long as Heaven and earth last. Any demarche in violation of this law
of Islam, with regard to Palestine, is baseless and reflects on its perpetrators.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! This is certain truth. Therefore 0 Muhammed, praise the
name of thy Lord, the Tremendous." Sura LVI (the Event), Verse 95.23</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas in Palestine: Its Views on Homeland and
Nationalism(24)</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Twelve</B>

<P>Hamas regards Nationalism (Wataniyya) as part and parcel of the religious
faith. Nothing is loftier or deeper in Nationalism than waging Jihad against
the enemy and confronting him when he sets foot on the land of the Muslims.
And this becomes an individual duty(25) binding on every Muslim man and
woman; a woman must go out and fight the enemy even without her husband's
authorization, and a slave without his masters' permission.

<P>This [principle] does not exist under any other regime, and it is a
truth not to be questioned. While other nationalisms consist of material,
human and territorial considerations, the nationality of Hamas also carries,
in addition to all those, the all important divine factors which lend to
it its spirit and life; so much so that it connects with the origin of
the spirit and the source of life and raises in the skies of the Homeland
the Banner of the Lord, thus inexorably connecting earth with Heaven.

<P>When Moses came and threw his baton, sorcery and sorcerers became futile.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"...The right direction is henceforth distinct from error.,
And he who rejects false deities and believes in Allah has grasped a firm
handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower." Sura II (the
Cow), verse 256(26).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Peaceful Solutions [Peace] Initiatives and International
Conferences</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Thirteen</B>

<P>[Peace] initiatives, the so-called peaceful solutions, and the international
conferences to resolve the Palestinian problem, are all contrary to the
beliefs of the Islamic Resistance Movement. For renouncing any part of
Palestine means renouncing part of the religion; the nationalism of the
Islamic Resistance Movement is part of its faith, the movement educates
its members to adhere to its principles and to raise the banner of Allah
over their homeland as they fight their Jihad: "Allah is the all-powerful,
but most people are not aware."

<P>From time to time a clamouring is voiced, to hold an International Conference
in search for a solution to the problem. Some accept the idea, others reject
it, for one reason or another, demanding the implementation of this or
that conditions, as a prerequisite for agreeing to cthe Conference or for
participating in it. But the Islamic Resistance Movement, which is aware
of the [prospective] parties to this conference, and of their past and
present positions towards the problems of the Muslims, does not believe
that those conferences are capable of responding to demands, or of restoring
rights or doing justice to the oppressed. Those conferences are no more
than a means to appoint the nonbelievers as arbitrators in the lands of
Islam. Since when did the Unbelievers do justice to the Believers?

<P>And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians,
till thou follow their creed. 'Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah [himself]
is the Guidance. And if you should follow their desires after the knowledge
which has come unto thee, then you would have from Allah no protecting
friend nor helper." Sura 2 (the Cow) verse 120. There is no solution to
the Palestinian problem except by Jihad. The initiatives, proposals and
International Conferences are but a waste of time(27), an exercise in futility.
The Palestinian people are too noble to have their future, their right
and their destiny submitted to a vain game. As the Hadith has it:

<P>"The people of Syria are Allah's whip on this land; He takes revenge
by their intermediary from whoever he wishes among his worshippers. The
Hypocrites among them are forbidden from vanquishing the true believers,
and they will die in anxiety and sorrow." (Told by Tabarani, who is traceable
in ascending order of traditionaries to Muhammed, and by Ahmed whose chain
of transmission is incomplete. But it is bound to be a true hadith, for
both story tellers are reliable. Allah knows best(28).)
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Three Circles</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Fourteen</B>

<P>The problem of the liberation of Palestine relates to three circles:
the Palestinian, the Arab and the Islamic. Each one of these circles has
a role to play in the struggle against Zionism and it has duties to fulfill.
It would be an enormous mistake and an abysmal act of ignorance to disregard
anyone of these circles. For Palestine is an Islamic land where the First
Qibla(29) and the third holiest site(30) are located. That is also the
place whence the Prophet, be Allah's prayer and peace upon him, ascended
to Heavens(31).
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Glorified be He who carried His servant by night from the
Inviolable Place of worship(32) to the Far Distant Place of Worship(33),
the neighborhood whereof we have blessed, that we might show him of our
tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer." Sura XVII (al-Isra,)(34),
verse 1.</BLOCKQUOTE>
In consequence of this state of affairs, the liberation of that land is
an individual duty binding on all Muslims everywhere(35). This is the base
on which all Muslims have to regard the problem; this has to be understood
by all Muslims. When the problem is dealt with on this basis, where the
full potential of the three circles is mobilized, then the current circumstances
will change and the day of liberation will come closer.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"You are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah. That
is because they are a folk who understand not." Sura LIX, (Al-Hashr, the
Exile), verse 13.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine is an
Individual</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Obligation(36)</B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Fifteen</B>

<P>When our enemies usurp some Islamic lands, Jihad becomes a duty binding
on all Muslims. In order to face the usurpation of Palestine by the Jews,
we have no escape from raising the banner of Jihad. This would require
the propagation of Islamic consciousness among the masses on all local,
Arab and Islamic levels. We must spread the spirit of Jihad among the [Islamic]
Umma, clash with the enemies and join the ranks of the Jihad fighters.

<P>The 'ulama as well as educators and teachers, publicity and media men
as well as the masses of the educated, and especially the youth and the
elders of the Islamic Movements, must participate in this raising of consciousness.
There is no escape from introducing fundamental changes in educational
curriculi in order to cleanse them from all vestiges of the ideological
invasion which has been brought about by orientalists and missionaries.
That invasion had begun overtaking this area following the defeat of the
Crusader armies by Salah a-Din el Ayyubi(37). The Crusaders had understood
that they had no way to vanquish the Muslims unless they prepared the grounds
for that with an ideological invasion which would confuse the thinking
of Muslims, revile their heritage, discredit their ideals to be followed
by a military invasion. That was to be in preparation for the Imperialist
invasion, as in fact [General] Allenby(38) acknowledged it upon his entry
to Jerusalem: "Now, the Crusades are over." General Gouraud(39) stood on
the tomb of Salah a-Din and declared: 'We have returned, O Salah-a-Din!"
Imperialism has been instrumental in boosting the ideological invasion
and deepening its roots, and it is still pursuing this goal. All this had
paved the way to the loss of Palestine. We must imprint on the minds of
generations of Muslims that the Palestinian problem is a religious one,
to be dealt with on this premise. It includes Islamic holy sites such as
the Aqsa Mosque, which is inexorably linked to the Holy Mosque(40) as long
as the Heaven and earth will exist, to the journey of the Messenger of
Allah(41), be Allah's peace and blessing upon him, to it, and to his ascension
from it(42).
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Dwelling one day in the Path of Allah is better than the entire
world and everything that exists in it. The place of the whip of one among
you in Paradise is better than the entire world and everything that exists
in it. [God's] worshipper's going and coming in the Path of Allah is better
than the entire world and everything that exists in it...." (Told by Bukhari,
Muslim, Tirmidhi and Ibn Maja)(43)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>I swear by that who holds in His Hands the Soul of Muhammed! I indeed
wish to go to war for the sake of Allah! I will assault and kill, assault
and kill, assault and kill (told by Bukhari and Muslim(44)).
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Educating the [Young] Generations</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><P><B>Article Sixteen</B>

<P>We must accord the Islamic [young] generations in our area, an Islamic
education based on the implementation of religious precepts, on the conscientious
study of the Book of Allah; on the Study of the Prophetic Tradition(45),
on the study of Islamic history and heritage from its reliable sources,
under the guidance of experts and scientists(46); and on singling out the
paths which constitute for the Muslims sound concepts of thinking and faith.
It is also necessary to study conscientiously the enemy and its material
and human potential; to detect its weak and strong spots, and to recognize
the powers that support it and stand by it. At the same time, we must be
aware of current events, follow the news and study the analyses and commentaries
on it, together with drawing plans for the present and the future and examining
every phenomenon, so that every Muslim, fighting Jihad, could live out
his era aware of his objective, his goals, his way and the things happening
round him.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O my dear son! Lo! though it be but the weight of a grain
of mustard-seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the
earth, Allah will bring it forth. Lo! Allah is subtile. Aware. 0 my dear
son! Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid inequity and persevere,
whatever may befall thee. Lo! that is of the steadfast heart of things.
Turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk, nor walk with pertness in the
land. Lo! Allah loves not braggarts and boasters." Sura XXXI (Luqman),
verses 16-18.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Role of Muslim Women</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Seventeen</B>

<P>The Muslim women have a no lesser role than that of men in the war of
liberation; they manufacture men and play a great role in guiding and educating
the [new] generation. The enemies have understood that role, therefore
they realize that if they can guide and educate [the Muslim women] in a
way that would distance them from Islam, they would have won that war.
Therefore, you can see them making consistent efforts [in that direction]
by way of publicity and movies, curriculi of education and culture, using
as their intermediaries their craftsmen who are part of the various Zionist
Organizations which take oall sorts of names and shapes such as: the Free
Masons, Rotary Clubs, gangs of spies and the like. All of them are nests
of saboteurs and sabotage. Those Zionist organizations control vast material
resources, which enable them to fulfill their mission amidst societies,
with a view of implementing Zionist goals and sowing the concepts that
can be of use to the enemy. Those organizations operate [in a situation]
where Islam is absent from the arena and alienated from its people. Thus,
the Muslims must fulfill their duty in confronting the schemes of those
saboteurs. When Islam will retake possession of [the means to] guide the
life [of the Muslims], it will wipe out those organizations which are the
enemy of humanity and Islam.

<P><B>Article Eighteen</B>

<P>The women in the house and the family of Jihad fighters, whether they
are mothers or sisters, carry out the most important duty of caring for
the home and raising the children upon the moral concepts and values which
derive from Islam; and of educating their sons to observe the religious
injunctions in preparation for the duty of Jihad awaiting them. Therefore,
we must pay attention to the schools and curriculi upon which Muslim girls
are educated, so as to make them righteous mothers, who are conscious of
their duties in the war of liberation. They must be fully capable of being
aware and of grasping the ways to manage their households. Economy and
avoiding waste in household expenditures are prerequisites to our ability
to pursue our cause in the difficult circumstances surrounding us. Therefore
let them remember at all times that money saved is equivalent to blood,
which must be made to run in the veins in order to ensure the continuity
of life of our young and old.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Lo, men who surrender unto Allah, and women who surrender
and men who believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who
obey, and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth and men
who persevere (in righteousness) and women who persevere and men who are
humble and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give
alms, and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their modesty
and women who guard [their modesty], and men who remember Allah much and
women who remember that Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a vast
reward." Sura 33 (Al-Ahzab, the Clans), verse 35.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Role of Islamic Art in the War of Liberation</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Nineteen</B>

<P>Art has rules and criteria by which one can know whether it is Islamic
or Jahiliyya(47) art. The problems of Islamic liberation underlie the need
for Islamic art which could lift the spirit, and instead of making one
party triumph over the other, would lift up all parties in harmony and
balance.

<P>Man is a strange and miraculous being, made out of a handful of clay
and a breath of soul; Islamic art is to address man on this basis, while
Jahili art addresses the body and makes the element of clay paramount.
So, books, articles, publications, religious exhortations, epistles, songs,
poems, hymns, plays, and the like, if they possess the characteristics
of Islamic art, have the requisites of ideological mobilization, of a continuous
nurturing in the pursuance of the journey, and of relaxing the soul. The
road is long and the suffering is great and the spirits are weary; it is
Islamic art which renews the activity, revives the movement and arouses
lofty concepts and sound planning. The soul cannot thrive, unless it knows
how to contrive, unless it can transit from one situation to another. All
this is a serious matter, no jesting. For the umma(48) fighting its Jihad
knows no jesting.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Social Solidarity</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Twenty</B>

<P>Islamic society is one of solidarity. The Messenger of Allah, be Allah's
prayer and peace upon him, said:

<P>What a wonderful tribe were the Ash'aris! When they were overtaxed,
either in their location or during their journeys, they would collect all
their possessions and then would divide them equally among themselves.

<P>This is the Islamic spirit which ought to prevail in any Muslim society.
A society which confronts a vicious, Nazi-like enemy, who does not differentiate
between man and women, elder and young ought to be the first to adorn itself
with this Islamic spirit. Our enemy pursues the style of collective punishment
of usurping(49) people's countries and properties, of pursuing them into
their exiles and places of assembly. It has resorted to breaking bones,
opening fire on women and children and the old, with or without reason,
and to setting up detention camps where thousands upon thousands are interned
in inhuman conditions. In addition, it destroys houses, renders children
orphans and issues oppressive judgements against thousands of young people
who spend the best years of their youth in the darkness of prisons. The
Nazism of the Jews does not skip women and children, it scares everyone.
They make war against people's livelihood, plunder their moneys and threaten
their honour. In their horrible actions they mistreat people like the most
horrendous war criminals. Exiling people from their country is another
way of killing them. As we face this misconduct, we have no escape from
establishing social solidarity among the people, from confronting the enemy
as one solid body, so that if one organ is hurt the rest of the body will
respond with alertness and fervor.

<P><B>Article Twenty One</B>

<P>Social solidarity consists of extending help to all the needy, both
materially and morally, or assisting in the execution of certain actions.
It is incumbent upon the members of the Hamas to look after the interests
of the masses the way they would look after their own interests. They must
spare no effort in the implementation and maintenance of those interests,
and they must avoid playing with anything that might effect the future
generations or cause damage to their society. For the masses are of them
and for them, their strength is [ultimately] theirs and their future is
theirs. The members of Hamas must share with the people its joys and sorrows,
and adopt the demands of the people and anything likely to fulfill its
interests and theirs. When this spirit reigns, congeniality will deepen,
cooperation and compassion will prevail, unity will firm up, and the ranks
will be strengthened in the confrontation with the enemy.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Powers which Support the Enemy</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Twenty Two</B>

<P>The enemies have been scheming for a long time, and they have consolidated
their schemes, in order to achieve what they they have achieved. They took
advantage of key-elements in unfolding events, and accumulated a huge and
influential material wealth which they put to the service of implementing
their dream. This wealth [permitted them to] take over control of the world
media such as news agencies, the press, publication houses, broadcasting
and the like. [They also used this] wealth to stir revolutions in various
parts of the globe in order to fulfill their interests and pick the fruits.
They stood behind the French and the Communist Revolutions and behind most
of the revolutions we hear about here and there. They also used the money
to establish clandestine organizations which are spreading around the world,
in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests. Such organizations
are: the Free Masons, Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs, B'nai B'rith and the like.
All of them are destructive spying organizations. They also used the money
to take over control of the Imperialist states and made them colonize many
countries in order to exploit the wealth of those countries and spread
their corruption therein.

<P>As regards local and world wars, it has come to pas s and no one objects,
that they stood behind World War 1, so as to wipe out the Islamic Caliphate(50).
They collected material gains and took control of many sources of wealth.
They obtained the Balfour Declaration(51) and established the League of
Nations in order to rule the world by means of that organization. They
also stood behind World War II, where they collected immense benefits from
trading with war materials, and prepared for the establishment of their
state. They inspired the establishment of the United Natioand the Security
Council to replace the League of Nations, in order to rule the world by
their intermediary. There was no war that broke out anywhere without their
fingerprints on it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"...As often as they light a fire for war, Allah extinguishes

<P>The Hamas views the other Islamic movements with respect and appreciation.
Even when it differs from them in one aspect or another or on one concept
or another, it agrees with them in other aspects and concepts. It reads
those movements as included in the framework of striving [for the sake
of Allah], as long as they hold sound intentions and abide by their devotion
to Allah, and as long as their conduct remains within the perimeter of
the Islamic circle. All the fighters of Jihad have their reward.

<P>The Hamas regards those movements as its stock holders and asks Allah
for guidance and integrity of conduct for all. It shall not fail to continue
to raise the banner of unity and to exert efforts in order to implement
it, [based] upon the [Holy] Book and the [Prophet's] Tradition(53).

<P><B>Article Twenty Four</B>

<P>Hamas will not permit the slandering and defamation of individuals and

despite the need to differentiate between that and the positions and modes
of conduct adopted by individuals and groups whenever the Hamas detects
faulty positions and modes of conduct, it has the right to point to the
mistake, to denigrate it, to act for spelling out the truth and for adopting
it realistically in the context of a given problem. Wisdom is roaming around,
and the Believer ought to grasp it wherever he can find it.

firmly as long as they do not owe their loyalty to the Communist East or
to the Crusader West. We reiterate to every one who is part of them or
sympathizes with them that the Hamas is a movement of Jihad, or morality
and consciousness in its concept of life. It moves forward with the others,
abhors opportunism, and only wishes well to individuals and groups. It
does not aspire to material gains, or to personal fame, nor does it solicit
remuneration from the people. It sets out relying on its own material resources,
and what is available to it, [as it is said] 'afford them the power you
can avail yourself of." [All that] in order to carry out its duty, to gain
Allah's favor; it has no ambition other than that.

<P>All the nationalist streams, operating in the Palestinian arena for
the sake of the liberation of Palestine, may rest assured that they will
definitely and resolutely get support and assistance, in speech and in
action, at the present and in the future, [because Hamas aspires] to unite,
not to divide; to safeguard, not to squander; to bring together, not to
fragment. It values every kind word, every devoted effort and every commendable
endeavor. It closes the door before marginal quarrels, it does not heed
rumours and biased statements, and it is aware of the right of self-defense.

<P>The Hamas, while it views positively the Palestinian National Movements

<P>The PLO is among the closest to the Hamas, for its constitutes a father,

his brother, his relative or his friend? Our homeland is one, our calamity
is one, our destiny is one and our enemy is common to both of us. Under
the influence of the circumstances which surrounded the founding of the
PLO, and the ideological confusion which prevails in the Arab world as
a result of the ideological invasion which has swept the Arab world since
the rout of the Crusades, and which has been reinforced by Orientalism
and the Christian Mission, the PLO has adopted the idea of a Secular State,
and so we think of it. Secular thought is diametrically opposed to religious
thought. Thought is the basis for positions, for modes of conduct and for
resolutions. Therefore, in spite of our appreciation for the PLO and its
possible transformation in the future, and despite the fact that we do
not denigrate its role in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we cannot substitute
it for the Islamic nature of Palestine by adopting secular thought. For
the Islamic nature of Palestine is part of our religion, and anyone who
neglects his religion is bound to lose.
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And who forsakes the religion of Abraham, save him who befools

When the PLO adopts Islam as the guideline for life, then we shall become
its soldiers, the fuel of its fire which will bum the enemies. And until
that happens, and we pray to Allah that it will happen soon, the position
of the Hamas towards the PLO is one of a son towards his father, a brother
towards his brother, and a relative towards his relative who suffers the
other's pain when a thorn hits him, who supports the other in the Confrontation
with the enemies and who wishes him divine guidance and integrity of conduct.

desires. It relies to a great extent, for its meddling and spying activities,
on the clandestine organizations which it has established, such as the
Free Masons, Rotary Clubs, Lions, and other spying associations. All those
secret organizations, some which are overt, for the interests of Zionism
and under its directions, strive to demolish societies, to destroy values,
to wreck answerableness(58), to totter virtues and to wipe out Islam. It
stands behind the diffusion of drugs and toxics of all kinds in order to
facilitate its control and expansion.

<P>The Arab states surrounding Israel are required to open their borders
to the Jihad fighters, the sons of the Arab and Islamic peoples, to enable
them to play their role and to join their efforts to those of their brothers
among the Muslim Brothers in Palestine.

<P>The other Arab and Islamic states are required, at the very least, to
facilitate the movement of the Jihad fighters from and to them. We cannot

as well as in information, in time and space. Among other things, they
hold solidarity meetings, issue explanatory publications, supportive articles

the problems it faces and of the plans to resolve them; and to mobilize
the Islamic peoples ideologically, educationally and culturally in order

<P>Under the shadow of Islam it is possible for the members of the three
religions: Islam, Christianity and Judaism to coexist in safety and security.
Safety and security can only prevail under the shadow of Islam, and recent

other religions must desist from struggling against Islam over sovereignty
in this region. For if they were to gain the upper hand, fighting, torture
and uprooting would follow; they would be fed up with each other, to say
nothing of members of other religions. The past and the present are full

<P>World Zionism and Imperialist forces have been attempting, with smart
moves and considered planning, to push the Arab countries, one after another,
out of the circle of conflict with Zionism, in order, ultimately, to isolate
the Palestinian People. Egypt has already been cast out of the conflict,
to a very great extent through the treacherous Camp David Accords, and
she has been trying to drag other countries into similar agreements in
order to push them out of the circle of conflict.

<P>Hamas is calling upon the Arab and Islamic peoples to act seriously
and tirelessly in order to frustrate that dreadful scheme and to make the
masses aware of the danger of coping out of the circle of struggle with
Zionism. Today it is Palestine and tomorrow it may be another country or
other countries. For Zionist scheming has no end, and after Palestine they
will covet expansion from the Nile to the Euphrates. Only when they have
completed digesting the area on which they will have laid their hand, they
will look forward to more expansion, etc. Their scheme has been laid out
in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and their present [conduct] is
the the best proof of what is said there.

<P>Leaving the circle of conflict with Israel is a major act of treason

<P>Palestine is the navel of earth, the convergence of continents, the
object of greed for the greedy, since the dawn of history. The Prophet,
may Allah's prayer and peace be upon him, points out to that fact in his
noble hadith(62) in which he implored his venerable Companion, Ma'adh ibn
Jabl, saying:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O Ma'adh, Allah is going to grant you victory over Syria after
me, from Al-Arish to the Euphrates, while its men, women, and female slaves
will be dwelling there until the Day of Resurrection. Those of you who
chose [to dwell] in one of the plains of Syria or Palestine(63) will be
in a state of Jihad to the Day of Resurrection."</BLOCKQUOTE>
The greedy have coveted Palestine more than once and they raided it with
armies in order to fulfill their covetousness. Multitudes of Crusades descended
on it, carrying their faith with them and waving their Cross. They were
able to defeat the-Muslims for a long time, and the Muslims were not able
to redeem it until their sought the protection of their religious banner;
then, they unified their forces, sang the praise of their God and set out
for Jihad under the Command of Saladin al-Ayyubi, for the duration of nearly
two decades, and then the obvious conquest took place when the Crusaders
were defeated and Palestine was liberated(64).
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Say (O Muhammed) unto those who disbelieve: ye shall be overcome

This is the only way to liberation, there is no doubt in the testimony
of history. That is one of the rules of the universe and one of the laws
of existence. Only iron can blunt iron, only the true faith of Islam can
vanquish their false and falsified faith. Faith can only be fought by faith.
Ultimately victory is reserved to the truth, and truth is victorious.

<P><B>Article Thirty Five</B>

<P>Hamas takes a serious look at the defeat of the Crusades at the hand
of Saladin the Ayyubid and the rescue of Palestine from their domination;
at the defeat of the Tatars at Ein Jalut (65) where their spine was broken
by Qutuz(66) and Al-Dhahir Baibars(67), and the Arab world was rescued
from the sweep of the Tatars which ruined all aspects of human civilization.
Hamas has learned from these lessons and examples, that the current Zionist
invasion had been preceded by a Crusader invasion from the West; and another
one, the Tatars, from the East. And exactly as the Muslims had faced those
invasions and planned their removal and defeat, they are able to face the
Zionist invasion and defeat it. This will not be difficult for Allah if
our intentions are pure and our determination is sincere; if the Muslims
draw useful lessons from the experiences of the past, and extricate themselves
for the vestiges of the [western] ideological onslaught; and if they follow
the traditions of Islam.

<P>l. Hamas, the acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement; (Harakat
Muqawama Islamiyya) literally means "enthusiasm," "zeal," "fanaticism,"
which is quite descriptive of their mode of operation.

<P>2. This is the classical Muslim designation for Jews and Christians
whose scriptures had been acknowledged by Islam, except that they were
accused of having forged parts of their holy texts, thus making the divine
message of the Quran, which supplanted them, an updated imperative.

<P>3. This means that unless the Scriptuary peoples, (specifically the
Jews), grasp and keep the Covenant which the Prophet had made with them
in Medinah, ignominy shall be their fate.

<P>4. Translation follows Muhammed Marmaduke Pickthall's The meaning of
the Glorious Koran, Mentor Books, N.Y., (no date). According to this translation,
the verses in question are 110-112.

<P>5. Hassan al-Banna was the founder of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt in
the 1920's. The Hamas claim affiliation with that movement.

<P>6. Da'wa, is the "call", the "Mission," which successive Islamic movements
have used as a euphemism for their indoctrination and missionary set up.
The Journal of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt is also call Da'wa.

<P>7. Holy War for the cause of Islam.

<P>8. "Faith" is used here in the traditional Islamic sense of conquest
by and for the sake of Islam. Hence the sanctity of the conquered land
as part of Dar-al-Islam, the Abode of Islam.

<P>9. Palestine was conquered by Umar ibn al-Khattab, one of the Prophet's
closest and ablest companions and the second Caliph of Islam (634-644).

<P>1O. The translation of the verse is Pickthall's, op. cit.

<P>11. Under Islam, Jews (and other Scriptuaries for that matter) are indeed
assured the status of Ahl-a-dhimma (protected people), which guarantees
their lives and properties as long as they submit to the rule of Islam,
pay the poll-tax (jizya) and conform to the restrictions imposed upon them
by Islamic rule.

<P>12. A prominent Indian-Muslim thinker and theologian.

<P>13. See the Authors Introduction for the context of Qassam's role in
Palestine in the 1930's.

<P>14. In the 1948 War of Israel's Independence, the Muslim Brothers played
a meaningful role. See the Author's Introduction.

<P>l5. During the "War of Attrition" which followed the Arab defeat of
1967, groups of the Muslim Brothers purportedly participated in attacks
against Israel.

<P>16. Reference is made to the Day of judgement. This tradition (Hadith),
which is imputed to the Prophet, has been often quoted in Islamic literature,
old and modem. The Egyptian troops who launched the assault on the Bar-Lev
Line in October 1973, were equipped with "booklets of guidance" which included,
inter alia, this same quotation.

<P>17. Some sort of desert tree, probably the wild orache.

<P>18. Bukhari and Muslim are the authors of the two most authoritative
and widely accepted collections of hadith (traditions of the Prophet).

<P>19. Waqf is a religendowment. There are various kinds: family and private
waqfs, whose proceeds accrue to the members of the donor's family, and
after the death of the last descendant go to a charitable purpose; public
endowments set apart for a charitable or religious purpose. The Holy land
is regarded, like all lands conquered forcibly by Islam, as unalienable
property belonging to the Muslim public.

<P>20. Shari'a is the Holy Law of Islam.

<P>21. The Second Caliph of Islam (634-644) after the death of the Prophet.
Under his reign the Islamic Empire, including Palestine, was established
and expanded.

<P>22. "Raqba" in Arabic could mean either control, supervision, guardianship,
or could be read "raqaba" and meaning the slaves working on the land.

<P>24. On the meaning of watan and wataniyya see the Author's Introduction.

<P>25. Fard 'ayn, is an individual duty under Islamic Law, to distinguish
from "Fard Kifaya," which is a collective duty. Fard 'ayn is an absolute
duty which overrides other considerations such as the duties of a wife
towards her husband and of a slave towards his master.

<P>26. It is significant that the first sentence of this verse -Mere is
no Compulsion in religion," which the Muslims often cite as a proof of
tolerance in Islam, was dropped from this quotation, indicating the absolute,
unshared and uncompromising truth of Islam, the "right direction."

<P>27. The heads of the Hamas, notably Sheikh Yasin of Gaza, when interviewed
by the media on their solution to the Palestinian problem, have termed
diplomatic demarches as a "waste of time."

<P>28. This is an allusion to the traditional Islamic method of scholarly
examination of hadiths of the Prophet in order to ascertain their veracity.

<P>29. Jerusalem was declared by the Prophet as the Qibla (direction of
prayer) for the Believers in Medina, apparently as a gesture towards the
Jews there, whom he hoped to convert them to his faith. However, after
he broke with the Jews, and when he conquered Mecca, this became the Qibla
of all Muslims. But Jerusalem retained its exalted title as the First Qibla.

<P>30. The two holiest shrines of Islam are in Mecca, where the Black Stone
of the Ka'ba is located, and Medina where the Prophet lived and died. Third
in line is the Haram-al-sharif on Temple Mount in Jerusalem where the Prophet
is believed to have ascended to the Seven Heavens (Mi'raj).

<P>31. The Masra is the point of departure for the Prophet's Journey to
Heavens.

<P>32. This is recognized in Islamic tradition as Mecca.

<P>33. The "far-distant place," in Arabic "Al-Aqsa" has been referred to

<P>35. See footnote 25 above.

<P>36. See footnote 25 above.

<P>37. Salah-a-din, or Saladin, a Muslim Kurd who ruled the Ayyubid Kingdom
at the time of the Crusaders, has become renowned after the defeat he inflicted
on the Crusades in the decisive Hittin battle (1187) and his second conquest
of Jerusalem for Islam (1189). In the modem world of Islam his memory has
been revived and cultivated as part of the struggle against Zionism, which
is usually likened, in contemporary Arab/Muslim literature, to the Medieval
Crusades.

<P>38. General Allenby took over Palestine from the Ottomans during World
War 1, to usher in the era of the British Mandate over Palestine which
lasted until 1948. No reference could be found by the author to anything
said by the British General relating his takeover of Jerusalem with the
Crusades.

<P>39. The Arabic original speaks about General "Guru," which is probably
a rendering of General Gouraud, the first French High Commissioner in Syria,
who is reputed to have uttered that statement.

<P>40. According to Islamic tradition, this was the place of the prophet's
point of departure for his Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem. See footnotes
26-31 above.

<P>41. See footnote 30 above.

<P>42. See footnotes 29-31 above.

<P>43. All Hadith collectors and transmitters, see footnote 18 above.

<P>44. See footnote 18 above.

<P>45. Reliance on the Quran and the Sunna (tradition of the prophet) is
characteristic of fundamentalist Islamic movements, who hold in low esteem
the other three of the usul-a-Din (the Foundation of the Faith, the Sources
of the Sharira Law), namely Qiyas (analogy), Ijma' (consensus) and Ada
(local customs).

<P>46. Scientists here are Ahl-el-Ilm-ulama (the Doctors of the Holy Law).

<P>47. Jahiliyya is the era of ignorance which preceded the coming of the
Prophet Muhammed, an era usually depicted in terms of oppression, lawlessness,
ungodliness, injustice and darkness, until the Prophetic Message Muhammed
brought light unto the Arabs of Arabia. Thereafter, any reversion to anti-Islamic
or a-Islamic rule, any renegation of Islam or act of Apostasy by Muslims
in all domains of life, have been described by Islamic fundamentalist literature
as a return to "Jahiliyya."

<P>48. The umma is the universal congregation of all Muslims.

<P>49. Reference is made to Israel's occasional actions among Palestinian
populations across its borders.

<P>50. The dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire signalled indeed the end
of the Caliphate.

<P>51. The famous letter of Lord Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary,
dated 2 November 1917, in which he pledged Britain's help to establish
a Jewish Homeland in Palestine, which was to be given as a mandate to the
British after the war.

<P>52. This is only part of the verse which refers specifically to the
Jews and says, inter alia, "we have cast among them enmity and hatred till
the Day of Resurrection."

<P>53. See Footnote 45 above.

<P>54. In Pickthall's translation, it is verse 103.

<P>55. In view of what was said above about the Jews, as individuals and
as a

<P>group, it appears that they are the exception to this rule.

<P>56. In Pickthall's translation, they are verses 148-9.

<P>57. The reference is to a man who brought false news of a revolt of
the subject Jews at Khaybar.

<P>58. The term used is "Dhimam," the plural of "Dhimma," the very word
in Islamic tradition, which defined the status of Jews (and Christians)
under Islam. these People were protected and safe if they paid a special
Capital tax and recognized the hegemony of Islam.

<P>59. It is impossible to ascertain what this claim is based on. There
is a popular Arabic song which denigrated those who failed to rear sons
and only left behind daughters.

<P>60. Despite their protestation to the contrary, the Hamas uses Jews
and Zionism interchangeably. The thrust of their assault is against Zionism,
but by introducing incidentally anti-semitic themes, such as the "Protocols
of the Elders of Zion," which preceded the birth of Zionism, they expose
their real intent against Jews in general.

<P>61. This verse explicitly talks about the Jews in its first part which
is not quoted here.

<P>62. A tradition related to the Prophet and indicating that he did or
said or approved of a particular thing. Since the Prophet is taken to be
the most noble of men and his life is a model to be emulated, knowing the
Hadith and acting upon it is regarded as one of the loftiest pursuits in
Islam.

<P>63. The term used is "Bayt al-maqdas," namely the Holy House. This term
was used to denominate Jerusalem and then, by extension, all Palestine:

<P>64. See footnote 37.

<P>65. The battle of Ein Jalut (1260) is the one that arrested the advance
of the Mongols in the Middle East when they were defeated by the Muslim
Mameluks under Baibars (1223-1277).

<P>67. See footnote 65 above..
