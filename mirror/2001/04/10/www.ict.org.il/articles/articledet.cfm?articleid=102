<p><center><h2>Islamic Terrorist Activities in Turkey in the 1990s</h2></center>
<P><b>Ely Karmon</b>
<BR><b>ICT Senior Researcher</b>
<P><font size="-1">This article was first published in Terrorism and Political Violence,
Vol. 10, No.4 (Winter 1998), pp.101-121.</font>

<P><p>This article focuses on Islamic terrorism in the framework of overall
Islamic activity in Turkey. It argues that Islamic terrorist organizations
active in Turkey during the 1990s strived to establish an Islamic Sharia’-based
state on the Iranian model, profited from deeper social and political trends
in Turkish society, and at the same time strengthened these trends by their
violence. These groups enjoyed wide Iranian support and often acted on
behalf of Iranian local, regional, political and strategic interests. The
reaction of Turkish authorities in the past to Islamic terrorist activity
was limited and thus encouraged leaders of these groups and their sponsors
to continue escalating violence hoping it will bring down the secular democratic
regime in Turkey.
<p>Most observers in Turkey and abroad have viewed the Kurdish Workers’
Party (PKK) as the main threat to the Turkish state’s national unity and
defense.[1] Despite recent interest in the Islamic fundamentalist Welfare
Party’s (<i>Refah Partisi</i>, RP) growth, hardly any research examines
the radical and violent Islamic movements there.[2] The violent groups
are largely ignored because of their small size and apparently limited
threat.[3]
<p>It has been argued that the marginality of violent Islamist groups in
Turkey in contrast to the vigorous armed opposition in Egypt or Algeria
is due to the Turkish political system’s pluralism and the RP’s full integration
into this system.[4] But the leaders and sponsors of these extremist organizations
think that by violence against the secular symbols of the Turkish state,
leading secular intellectuals and journalists, and representatives of “Imperialism
and Zionism,” they will indeed help install an Islamic state. The limited
reaction by the authorities up to 1996 and the RP’s electoral victories
seemed to provide reasons for this hope.
<p><p><b>Political and Strategic Background</b>
<p>The military coup of 1980 was intended to end a long period of widespread
terrorism and violence throughout the country perpetrated by extremist
left-wing and right-wing organizations, and also to hold back the threat
of radical Islam embodied in the National Salvation Party led by Necmettin
Erbakan.[5] But while military rule between 1980-1983 did break up the
extreme left and right, the Islamic movement survived and even grew in
importance during the 1980s.[6]
<p>A new ideological concept was developed by a group of right-wing intellectuals
(Intellectuals’ Hearth—<i>Aidinlar Ocagi</i>) and adopted by the military,
“The Turkish-Islamic Synthesis” which, on its pragmatic side, represented
an attempt to integrate Islamists and the nationalists.[7] The main idea
was that the Islamist influence in the system would contribute to the territorial
integrity of the Turkish nation-state and counter revolutionary sentiments,
especially among Kurdish youth. The Islamists offered an attractive alternative
even for ex-communists after the collapse of communism in the Soviet bloc.[8]
<p>On the foreign front, the Turkish-Islamic synthesis was supposed to
help contain Soviet expansion southward and to combat the radical Iranian
brand of Islam by constructing a coalition of U.S.-backed moderate Islamic
states. This policy favored closer relations with Saudi Arabia to gain
big loans for the needy Turkish economy.[9] The Cold War’s end, USSR’s
disintegration, the birth of new republics mostly inhabited by peoples
of Turk origin, the Gulf war’s result and the Bosnian crisis created at
the beginning of the 1990s a new international environment which put Turkey
in a key position, sometimes in direct competition with Iran for regional
strategic influence and economic assets.[10]
<p><b>The History of the “Islamic Movement” in Turkey.[11]</b>
<p>The Islamic subversive and terrorist activity in Turkey began in the
1960s. As early as 1967 and 1973 the leaders of <i>Hizb</i> <i>ut-Tahrir</i>
(Islamic Liberation Party) were imprisoned for attempting “to bring the
Islamic State Constitution to Turkey.”[12] Islamic Jihad appeared as a
real terrorist threat in the 1980s, after a series of assassinations of
Jordanian, Saudi and Iraqi diplomats. In October 1991 Islamic Jihad took
responsibility for killing an American sergeant and wounding an Egyptian
diplomat to protest the Middle East peace conference in Madrid.[13] For
many years it was assumed that this group was a Lebanese Shiite terrorist
organization, until it was discovered that a Turkish branch existed, engaging
in assassinations of secular intellectuals.
<p>As Anat Lapidot correctly notes, defining the Islamic movement is a
complex task, since the term is applied to different organizations, with
their own ideas and strategies, seeking to establish an Islamic state and
society. Citing Sabri Sayari, she distinguishes between traditionalists
and radicals, the latter being a minority inspired by the Iranian revolution.[14]
<p>Ismet Imset points to the confusion about these different groups among
the general public, researchers, and government circles in Turkey. A report
by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and the Security
General Directorate of the Police in October 1991 mentioned no less than
ten Islamic organizations active in Turkey: Turkish Islamic Liberation
Army (IKO), Turkish Islamic Liberation Front (TIK-C), Fighters of the Islamic
Revolution (IDAM), Turkish Islamic Liberation Union (TIKB), World Sharia
Liberation Army (DSKO), Universal Brotherhood Front-Sharia Revenge Squad
(EKC-SIM), Islamic Liberation party Front (IKP-C), Turkish Fighters of
the Universal Islamic War of Liberation (EIK-TM), Turkish Islamic Fighters
Army (IMO) and Turkish Sharia Revenge Commandos (TSIK).[15]
<p>In this article, Islamic movement is the term used to describe all the
currents in Turkish Islam while Islamic Movement refers to one of the main
radical groups.
<p>Imset makes a distinction between western and southeast Turkey. In the
West the Islamic Movement (<i>Islami Hareket</i>), called also Islamic
Resistance (<i>Islami Direnis</i>), is considered to represent the ideological
influence of the original (Iranian) Hezbollah.[16] Both Movement and Resistance
were only temporary code names, at least until 1990. In southeast Turkey
the movement spread first under the name of Hezbollah, then was referred
as the Hezbol-contra, to address its anti-PKK activity. According to Imset,
the concepts of Hezbollah and Islamic Movement are in fact one, representing
an umbrella organization of groups acting on behalf of what he calls “The
International Islamic Movement.”[17]
<p>At the end of the 1970s, under the influence of the coalition between
left-wing organizations and Khomeini`s followers in Iran, in Turkey was
established an alliance of the left, especially Maoists, with radical Islamic
elements and together they attacked the nationalist right. The conflict
peaked in February 1979 when a young Muslim leader was killed by nationalists
(known as “Idealists”) in the yard of the Fatih mosque in Istanbul.
<p>The Turkish Islamic Movement, like all other radical organizations,
received a serious blow during the September 1980 military coup. But, as
the regime encouraged the general Islamic trend as a solution to political
polarization and as both Marxists and nationalists lost their influence,
Islamic activists were afforded ample space to strengthen their position.
The “Hezbollah Muslims” appeared for the first time publicly in 1984 and,
as the original Hezbollah, proclaimed support for the Iranian revolution
and the defense not of nations or sects, but of “Allah’s way.”
<p>According to Imset, Kalim Siddiqui, a Pakistani active at the Muslim
Institute in London, had a key role in unifying Turkey`s radical Islamic
Movement. Thus, the first Hezbollahi appeared in Turkey as the “followers
of Siddiki.”[18] A pro-Hezbollah magazine published in November 1987 “The
guidelines of the Islamic Movement,” which included the acceptance of the
Islamic State as the center of religbelief, the leadership of Muslim scholars,
the spread of the mentality of martyrdom and the leadership of the Islamic
revolution [in Iran].[19]
<p>A significant development occurred in the middle of the 1980s, with
the conversion of some members of the right-wing Nationalist Movement (MHP)
to Islam. The death of one of their leaders in prison in 1984 and the tortures
suffered by many others convinced a group of extreme nationalist activists
“to turn to Allah” and condemn the “darkness of nationalism.”[20] They
were heavily influenced by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, but later concluded
that Sayyd Kutub’s death forced the Egyptian Islamists into a nationalist
position and that true Islam could not tolerate nationalism. These militants
were already professionals in the field of terrorism and street fighting
and represented a significant operational support for the Islamic Movement.
<p>In southeast Turkey, Islamic radicalism emerged in poor towns and villages
with a large Kurdish population (Dyarbakir, Silvan, Cizre, Kiziltepe and
others), especially among the young and unemployed. They followed the teachings
of local Muslim scholars or sheiks and often organized themselves around
extremist Islamic publications such as <i>Tevhid</i>, <i>Yeryuzu</i> and
<i>Objektif</i>. Their activity became more visible at the beginning of
the 1990s, influenced more and more by Khomeini`s teachings, and they were
identified by the local public as Hezbollah, although they considered themselves
as belonging to the Islamic Movement.
<p><b>The ideology of the Turkish Islamic Movement</b>
<p>There are few sources for research on the Turkish Islamic organizations,
although they have their own publications and manifestoes distributed quite
freely even when they threaten future victims of terrorist attacks. All
the material is in Turkish and has neither been collected nor translated.
The only other source consists of interviews given by anonymous leaders
and activists to Turkish journalists.
<p>In one such interviews, published in February 1993, a militant declared:
“We are fighters of the Islamic Liberation Movement, the sword against
Satan, blasphemy, Zionism and Imperialism. We have begun taking action
only recently in Turkey and our move is based on pain, suffering and patience.
We do not pursue a tribal case; our objective is to establish a state for
the Muslims.” Asked whether he belonged to Hezbollah, the militant replied
that the press gave that name to the organization and that they will adopt
it only when the movement will be worthy of it. Meanwhile it has not reached
“that level of perfection.”[21]
<p>In speaking about the special relationship of the Movement with Iran,
the same militant seemed careful not to confirm “the lies of the Turkish
state” about such links. Iran is seen as an example and a guide but the
instructions are “from the Koran” and not from Iran, “the land of Dar-ul
Islam where blasphemy has been crushed.” The Movement needs no instructions
from any country because the Koran is the program and shows the strategies
and the tactics to be adopted.[22]
<p>It seems that the Sunni origin of the radical Turkish Islamic groups
did not influence&nbsp; their close cooperation with the Iranian Shi’a
regime. The material published so far in the Turkish sources does not allow
the evaluation of the exact nature of these groups’ ideology: declarations
such as those cited above are general and not binding. Yet it is known
that various Sunni extremist organizations have viewed the Iranian revolution
and its leader Khomeini as a catalyst and a model for their own revolutionary
endeavor. This is the case of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and its
leader Fathi al-Shqaqi[23], as well as the Algerian Groupe Islamique Arme
(GIA),[24] who also received direct Iranian logistic and financial support.
The Algerian government even broke diplomatic relations with Iran on this
basis.
<p>For its part, the Iranian regime, in spite of its increasing nationalism
since the war with Iraq, has been keen to convince the Sunni movements
that it continued to stick to Khomeini’s Islamic universalistic ideology.
Khameneh’i, Iran’s spiritual leader, declared that his country wanted the
unity of all Muslim brothers [Sunni and Shi’i], unity focusing on what
all Muslims have in common—the Prophet, the Qur’an and the struggle against
common enemies.[25]
<p>A report prepared by the Turkish security authorities for the National
Security Council at the beginning of 1997 outlined the objectives of the
radical religious movements and stressed that their strategy consists of
three stages.[26]
<p>The first stage is the message (<i>teblig</i>), and calls for an effort
by the radicals to persuade the people to adopt the Islamic religion, establish
an Islamic state and administration, live in accordance with Islamic rules
and struggle to safeguard the Islamic way of life.
<p>The second stage is the community (<i>cemaat</i>) and calls for the
restructuring of communities in accordance with the requirements of the
first stage.
<p>The third stage is the struggle (<i>jihad</i>) and calls for the armed
struggle to safeguard the Islamic way of life.
<p>Special mention should be made of a strange organization called The
Great Eastern Islamic Fighters Front (IBDA-C), active since the middle
of the 1970s but more extremist and aggressive since the beginning of the
1990s. Although an Islamic movement is struggling for the constitution
of an Islamic state, it uses leftist slogans in its publications and accepts
ex-Marxists in its ranks. It is also extremely antisemitic and anti-Christian
in its propaganda and terrorist activity as well. It is interesting to
note that IBDA-C’s publications do not show any particular pro-Iranian
tendency.
<p><b>Enemies and Strategic Objectives</b>
<p>A chronological analysis of terrorist activity of Islamic groups shows
that 1990 was probably the starting point for their offensive against the
Turkish secular establishment: A professor, journalist, political scientist
and writer were assassinated by Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Operation
(or Action), the first time this name was used.[27] Muammar Aksoy, a liberal
political scientist, was also killed in 1990 and then for the first time
the name Islamic Movement appeared.[28]
<p>During 1991, the year of the Gulf War, Islamic radicals seemed to enter
a period of reassessment, which ended after the opening of the Madrid peace
talks between Arab countries and Israel. In October an American soldier
was killed and an Egyptian diplomat wounded by Islamic Jihad.[29] The year
1992 represented the turning point in radical Islamic terrorist activity,
the objectives attacked during this year being from the exiled Iranian
opposition as well as Jews and Israelis.[30]
<p>But the government, security authorities, public and even the press
became really aware of and shocked by the Islamic terrorist threat when
Ugur Mumcu, one of Turkey’s top investigative reporters - who had covered
the PKK, the rise of Islamic radicalism, and drug smuggling networks—was
killed on 24 January 1993 by a car-bomb similar to that used in the assassination
of an Israeli diplomat in March 1992 and an American computer specialist
in October 1991. Both the Islamic Liberation Organization and IBDA-C took
responsibility for the murder.[31]
<p>Several days later an attempt was made on the life of a well-known Turkish
businessman and community leader of Jewish origin, Jak Kamhi, by a group
of four terrorists who used automatic weapons and even a rocket-launcher.
He escaped uninjured. The same month the tortured body of an exiled Iranian
dissident—Abbas Gholizadeh, a former officer and the Shah’s bodyguard—kidnapped
several weeks before, was discovered by the police.
<p>This series of terrorist events provoked a sharp reaction from Turkish
public opinion: huge street demonstrations in favor of the secular regime,
a strong press campaign, and swift action by security authorities against
the perpetrators and their sponsors. For the first time the Islamic Action
or Movement and Iran were directly accused of and implicated in acts of
terror against the state. The arrests and interrogations of many Turkish
members of these organunveiled the story behind the killings of Turkish
secular intellectuals and anti-Khomeini Iranian exiles in the years 1990-1992.[32]
<p>But the arrest and trial of dozens of Islamic terrorists did not dissuade
more extremists from continuing to attack Turkish intellectuals fighting
for the secular state and values. In July 1993 they set fire to a hotel
where a cultural festival was taking place and 37 intellectuals were burned
to death.[33] Aziz Nesin, one of Turkey’s leading literary figures, was
the main individual target of the fundamentalists. He was accused of intending
to publish Salman Rushdie’s “Satanic Verses.” A trial opened against the
suspects of the massacre involved only 20 participants of a much bigger
group of those responsible.[34]
<p>The fight of the security authorities against the radicals continued
during 1994, when 659 members of Hizballah were caught, some of them responsible
for murders of activists in exiled Iranian opposition groups. In January,
four members of the Islamic Movement in Istanbul were arrested for their
part in the killing of a Mojahedin-e Khalq activist, the Shah’s ex-bodyguard
and a member of the Kurdish opposition, KDPI. In October, a six-man Hizballah
team was arrested while preparing to assassinate, on orders from Iranian
intelligence, a woman of Armenian descent guilty of employing “only” Muslim
women in her brothel! They were also involved in the assassination of Iranian
dissidents.[35]
<p>This same year IBDA-C was responsible for 90 terrorist incidents, including
five bombings in various cities.[36] A prominent cinema critic and writer,
Onat Kutlar, was killed in December by a bomb attack carried by IBDA-C
aimed “at spoiling the colonialist Noel [Christmas] celebrations.”[37]
<p>In 1995, attacks continued. IBDA-C may have been responsible for a bomb
attack in January on the building of the Ataturk Association and the attempted
assassination in June of a prominent Jewish community leader in Ankara.[38]
<p>One of the most controversial terrorist activities of Hizballah in southeast
Turkey has been the liquidation of dozens of pro-PKK activists, journalists,
intellectuals and politicians beginning in the fall of 1991 and throughout
1992 and 1993. It has been widely assumed that this was the work of some
splinter group. The amount of immunity it enjoyed from the security authorities
due to its anti-PKK nature, earned it the name “Hezbol-contra.”[39]
<p>It must be stressed that its members were mostly of Kurdish origin.
The Hizballah regarded the PKK as Islam’s enemy and has accused it of “trying
to create an atheist community, supporting the communist system, trying
to divide the people through chauvinist activities and directing pressure
on the Muslim people.”[40] An interviewed Hizballah militant in the southeast
described the goal of his organization as the establishment of an “ Islamic
Kurdish state in Turkey.”[41]
<p>In March 1993 the PKK signed a “cooperation protocol” with the “Hizballah
Kurdish Revolutionary Party” aimed at ending the conflict and finding “methods
for a joint struggle against the Turkish state.” The agreement was achieved
after Hizballah&nbsp; recognized that it has been exploited by “the colonialists”
and that the clashes in no way benefited the cause of Islam.[42]
<p>A turning point in the Turkish authorities’ attitude toward the Islamic
terrorist threat occurred in March 1996, with the arrest of one of the
leaders of Islamic Action, Irfan Cagarici, and his confessions about the
role his organization has played since the early 1990s in the assassination
of secular politicians and intellectuals, with direct support and supervision
of Iranian intelligence.[43]
<p>The relations between Turkey and Iran reached a new low as a result.
But then, in June 1996, the RP achieved power in an alliance with the center-right
True Path Party (DYP) in the first Islamic government in 73 years of secular
Kemalist regimes, with Erbakan as prime minister.[44]
<p>Since the advent of Erbakan’s government no significant terrorist Islamic
activity has been registered in Turkey. Even the growing military and strategic
cooperation between Turkey and Israel during 1996 and 1997 did not generate
any particular violent activity against the Turkish defense establishment
or Israeli targets, in spite of the clear opposition of the <i>Refah</i>
Party and the uneasiness and anxiety it provoked in Iran. The calm situation
on the radical Islamic front continued after the forced resignation of
the Erbakan government in July 1997 and the decision of Turkey’s Constitutional
Court to outlaw the RP on December 16, 1997.
<p><b>Islam’s growing political power and the problem of terrorism</b>
<p>The “Turkish-Islamist Synthesis” was a strategy adopted by the political
and military establishment at the beginning of the 1980s to counter revolutionary
sentiments—especially among Kurdish youth—with the traditional conservatism
of tribal leaders and Islamic scholars. The increase in the influence of
Islam seemed a modest price to pay for the territorial integrity of the
Turkish state.[45]
<p>Turgut Ozal, the first Prime Minister of a civilian government after
1983, himself had strong connections to the Nakshibandi religious order.
He pushed for a relaxation of Kemalist and secularist policies and a public
admission of Islam as an essential component of Turkish identity. During
the long period of his rule as Prime Minister and then president of Turkey,
Muslim associations, foundations, publications, television and radio stations,
flourished and spread the message of Islam. Islamists built strongholds
in the Ministry of Education.[46]
<p>The important role played by Islamic radical publications in the recruitment
and indoctrination of militants and the designation of objectives to be
attacked, cannot be underestimated: Two printing houses, the Istanbul-based
<i>Akademi</i> and <i>Objektif</i>, and the monthlies <i>Yeryuzu</i> and
<i>Tehvid</i> have been accused of being behind Hizballah.[47]
<p>IBDA-C sent death threats to the head of the Jewish community in Ankara
before a bomb was placed in his car, and published a list of Jewish targets
in the extreme religious periodical <i>Akinci</i> <i>Yolu</i>.[48] IBDA-C’s
weekly, <i>Taraf</i>, took responsibility for the bomb attack on the film
critic Onat Kutlar in December 1994 and sent “a warning not to play with
fire” to TV journalist Ali Kirca, whom it accused of being “anti-Islam.”[49]
<p>In this atmosphere, pro-Islamic politicians received important appointments
in the sensitive field of security, such as the Ministry of Interior. This
happened even before the 1980 coup, while it was under the control of Erbakan’s
National Salvation party. Under the interior minister at the end of the
1980s, Abdulkadir Aksu, the security apparatus—especially the intelligence
and personnel departments—was penetrated by pro-Islamic elements and the
slightest resistance to fundamentalism was broken. According to Ismet Imset,
during this period there was a general inclination in the Ministry towards
the “Saudi and even Iranian Islamism.” At the end of 1991, Aksu was replaced
as minister and an extensive purge was launched in the ranks of the Police
to rid it of fundamentalist officers.[50]
<p>According to Zubaida, 700 of the 1,600 key ministry executives, provincial
governors and other functionaries were believed to be RP supporters. Even
in April 1994 they permitted the waging of unauthorized mass Islamist demonstrations
in Ankara and Istanbul.[51] Ironically, they were reassigned to posts in
the southeast where they supported or ignored the attacks of Hizballah
against the PKK.
<p>The attitude of the Refah party’s leadership regarding the violence
and terror on the radical fringes of the Islamic movement is at least ambiguous,
if not clearly supportive. Erbakan condemned the violence used in the assassination
of journalist Mumcu in March 1993 and declared that it is incompatible
with the values of true Islam. But at the same time important members of
his party accused Israel of killing him.[52] In November 1993, Erbakan
said at his party’s parliamentary meeting that only “Islamic fraternity”
could combat the PKK, but he did not the terrorism of the Islamic groups
at all.[53] Some researchers have even considered Hizballah as the RP’s
armed protector.[54]
<p>Despite all the evidence, as late as the end of 1995 the leading Islamic
circles denied even the existence of fundamentalist terrorist organizations.
The deputy RP leader, Abdullah Gul, declared that no terror movement is
compatible with Islam and that the accusation is “being circulated intentionally
before the elections” in order to influence them. According to another
leader, most of the crimes in Turkey blamed on the Islamic movement are
in fact “international operations” and “plots of the West” against Turkey.[55]
<p>Erbakan’s real policy toward the Islamic terrorist groups can be judged
by the hosting of representatives of Palestinian Hamas, Egypt’s Muslim
Brothers and Algeria’s FIS at RP’s political convention after his ascent
to the premiership. Erbakan was not even impressed by President Mubarak’s
protest against the invitation of Egyptian Muslim Brothers to the party
congress, which sparked a diplomatic incident with Egypt. Over the years,
he maintained a strange silence about the complicity of neighboring Muslim
countries in anti-Turkish terrorism.[56]
<p><b>“The Iranian Connection” and Turkey’s reaction</b>
<p>It is quite obvious that there was deep Iranian involvement in the terrorist
activities waged by Islamic groups and organizations in Turkey. In several
of the most important and sensitive cases of terrorism, this interference
in Turkish internal political life was proved in court. In other cases
there was ample intelligence information transmitted or leaked to the press
by the security authorities. The Turkish Islamic militants indicted for
the murder of Mumcu and an Iranian dissident in 1993, and two of those
accused of murdering three intellectuals in 1990 and a Jewish businessman
in 1993, were connected with Iranian agents, among them diplomats stationed
in Turkey. They received military training in Iran, on “pursuit, counter-pursuit,
weapons and bombs.”[57]
<p>The Iranians began their propaganda and indoctrination work through
the numerous Cultural Centers they opened in Turkey. There they recruited
and sent to Iran for training sympathizers of Khomeini’s doctrine ready
to work for their interests.[58]
<p>As noted previously, an abrupt change occurred in the Turkish authorities’
attitude after Mumcu’s killing. It was only when the murders got out of
hand and under growing international criticism that Ankara acknowledged
that the Turkish Hizballah truly existed.[59]
<p>For the first time, a Turkish minister of interior declared at a press
conference that members of radical Islamic organizations underwent months
of military and theoretical training in Iranian security installations,
traveled with Iranian real and forged documents, had weapons and explosives
of Iranian origin and participated in attacks on Turkish citizens and also
Iranian opposition militants.[60]
<p>In spite of these grave revelations, the overall political approach
towards Iran was very cautious.[61] The minister of interior concluded
that Iran as a state was not behind these actions, that it had no interest
in such murders in Turkey, but, however, “the perpetrators had connections
in Iran.”[62]
<p>A detailed account of the “Iranian Connection” in these cases and the
official Turkish ambiguous position was given by Imset.[63] President Ozal
remarked that “foreign forces” may be behind provocative incidents and
may have supporters in Turkey, without naming them.[64] Prime Minister
Demirel called for a “coolheaded” approach to the Iranian link in order
not to disrupt bilateral relations unnecessarily. He expressed the belief
that the Iranian state was not involved in the murders and that it would
cooperate on the issue with the Turkish authorities.[65]
<p>Although Iranian officials denied any involvement in aiding or training
Turkish terrorist organizations, the Iranian Foreign Minister, Velayati,
had a more subtle reaction. In an interview to
<p>Turkish television he excluded even the possibility that any anti-Turkish
activity can be conducted on Iran’s territory and escape the Iranian state’s
control. He denied that Iran geared activities or movements against Turkey
but at the same time he accused its government of supporting, directly
or indirectly, terrorist groups opposed to the regime in Iran.
<p>He proposed then to discuss these “mutual allegations” in the framework
of the common security committee. He vaguely denied any ties with anti-secular
circles in Turkey but added that if there were groups in Turkey that liked
the Iranian model and were inspired by its values, it could not be argued
that Iran has created them. A Turkish political commentator noted that
Velayati’s general behavior during the interview strengthened the conviction
that Tehran supports acts of terrorism by radical Turkish supporters and
that Iran wanted to use Mumcu’s murder to bargain with Turkey.[66]
<p>Turkey has indeed given humanitarian shelter to more than a million
Iranians, many of them political refugees from Khomeini’s regime. In fact,
Iran has never presented any evidence of Turkey’s alleged involvement in
terrorist activities on its territory. It is known that since the end of
the Gulf War, the main opposition violent organization, Mujahedin-e Khalq,
has not mounted terrorist operations in Iran, apart from occasional cross-border
operations by its “National Liberation Army” from Iraqi soil and with Iraqi
assistance.[67]
<p>The relations between Turkey and Iran in the following years continued
to be strained, with persistent ups and downs. But the main matter of conflict
was now the issue of Iran’s support to the PKK. The PKK intensified its
terrorist activity in 1994 and began a campaign of international terrorism
inside and outside Turkey, while Iran offered a safe-haven to the PKK fighters.[68]
<p>The Iranian relative inactivity on the radical Islamic front was probably
also due to the successful operations waged by the Turkish security forces
against the Islamic groups and the consequent decline in their terrorist
activities in 1994 and 1995, compared with 1993. Radical Islamist organizations
staged 86 acts of violence in 1995, compared with 464 attacks in 1994.
A total of 25 persons died and 21 were wounded in these attacks, staged
mainly by Hizballah and IBDA-C. “<i>Ilim</i>,” one of Hizballah’s two splinter
groups (<i>Ilim</i> and <i>Menzil</i>) stopped most of its armed activity,
many cadre of the Islamic Movement were arrested and IBDA-C retained its
level of activity mostly by acts of bombing and arson.[69]
<p>The assassination in February 1996 in Istanbul of two leading Iranian
opposition activists and the arrest in March 1996 of the Islamic Action
leader, Irfan Cagarici, and his revelations about the “Iranian Connection”
again sparked the political and diplomatic dispute between the two governments.
But the accusations were related mainly to the old known terrorist attacks
of 1990-1993 and did not seriously affect bilateral relations.
<p>But then in June 1996 the Islamic-lead coalition came to power in Turkey
and Erbakan embarked upon an enthusiastic effort to improve relations with
Iran.[70] He visited Libya and Iran immediately after his nomination and
signed an agreement with Iran for the supply of natural gas for the amount
of 23 billion dollars. On the internal arena Erbakan tried to advance,
very cautiously, some fundamentalist reforms, such as to lift the ban on
head scarves for women in government offices and to encourage the attendance
of the religious schools.
<p>The Turkish military gave no respite to the new Islamic prime minister.
On August 3, 1996, the Supreme Military Council (SMC) convened under Erbakan
and all the commanders declared that “reactionism”, i.e. Islamic fundamentalism,
is becoming an important threat to Turkey and that the problem of attire,
the way people dress, is in fact a question of “intention and ideology.”
The military observed that although the extreme religious trends have intensified
their activities, the matter was not discussed in the SMC during the past
year.[71] Following this first direct warnin, President Demirel sent several
warning letters to the government, without result. On 27 January 1997 the
National Security Council (NSC) met and asked the prime minister to take
action, and not only make statements, in order to stop the “illegal activities”
and defend the secular regime. Finally, the NSC met again on 28 February
1997 and the military commanders attacked the government’s conduct and
asked for urgent action unless “undesirable” developments may take place.
<p>The events succeeded abruptly: on June 18, 1997, under the Army’s pressure,
Erbakan was forced to resign; on 16 January 1998 the Constitutional Court
outlawed the <i>Refah</i> Party and barred Erbakan from political life
for five years; in February 1998 a new party, the Virtue Party, replaced
the RP, gathering in its ranks some 130 parliamentarians from the old movement.
The circle seems to have closed.
<p>Iran’s policy of supporting and inciting Islamic terrorist activity
in Turkey in the early 1990s can be understood as its drive to export the
Islamic revolution to a key Muslim country, symbol of secularism and a
strategic adversary. Its evaluation of the complex Turkish internal situation
and the Islamic trend’s growing influence probably played an important
role in the decision to pursue such an aggressive policy. According to
this evaluation, the emergence of Turgut Ozal as leader of Turkey in the
1980s caused a gradual change in the relations between the two countries
because he succeeded in reducing the sense of opposition to Islam among
the political elite in Turkey, pursued a policy which included attention
to Islam and expansion of good relations with its Muslim neighbors. Islamic
Iran looked at Ozal’s policy on the whole positively and encouraged its
continuation.[72]
<p>The Gulf War, the defeat of Ozal’s Motherland Party in the elections
of early 1990s, stronger critical views of Islamic Iran among the Turkish
authorities, and the increasing press attacks against Iran, weakened Ozal’s
“legacy” after his death. Hostility toward Iran reached its peak when a
Turkish minister openly accused Iran of “creating insecurity” inside Turkey,
some border violations occurred and the Ankara authorities were reluctant
to curtail the activities of Iranian “counterrevolutionary groups” on its
territory. Ironically, Iran considered that its “excessively moderate and
reactive behavior” produced the escalation of Ankara’s “unfriendly approaches.”
<p>But the failure of secular power circles to get closer to Europe and
the United States as a solution for Turkey’s economic problems, the growth
of Islamism resulting in the RP’s victory and Erbakan’s premiership, and
Turkey’s need for Iran’s support to solve some regional problems, caused
a decline in tension between the two countries. According to the Iranian
evaluation, President Demirel’s inclination to “combine Islam with the
particular conditions of Turkey and the more Islamic viewpoints of Premier
Erbakan” made possible the improvement of the relations.[73]
<p>The Iranian regime welcomed the new pro-Islamic policy of Erbakan and
tried to make the best of it, on the economic as well as on the political
level. But the warming in relations did not interfere with the overall
strategy of furthering the Islamization of Turkey. In February 1997 the
Iranian ambassador to Turkey participated in an Islamic meeting for the
<i>al-Quds</i> Day in Ankara’s Sincan district together with the RP mayor,
from where he called for the liberation of Jerusalem. This incident gave
the Turkish army the occasion for a symbolic manifestation of the strength
of its armored forces in the streets of Sincan and caused the expulsion
of the un-diplomatic ambassador.
<p>The expanding military cooperation and the common maneuvers of the Turkish
and Israeli naval forces, which Erbakan was not able to cancel, caused
great concern in the Iranian governmental circles and were considered a
new American-Zionist plot to isolate and encircle Iran.[74] It seems that
the Iranian regime considers the conflict with Turkey not merely as a strategic
and political competition between two rival regional powers, but mostly
as an ideological battle between its radical Islamic worldview and Turkey’s
“adamant [will] to translate into practice the western concept of secularism.”[75]

<P><p><b>An Islamic scheme?</b>
<p>Most scholars agree that although Turkish Islam shares many common features
with other Middle East Islamic fundamentalist movements, it has grown and
developed in a very different political and social environment shaping
its unique nature. As Sami Zubaida points out, Turkey’s Islamist ideology
is tied up with Turkish nationalism in an unique fashion and challenges
the secularist components and European identification of Kemalism, the
dominant and official form of Turkish nationalism. At the same time the
RP, the Islamic movement’s leading political force, has integrated fully
in the Turkish pluralist system. This may account, according to Zubaida,
for the marginality of the violent Islamic groups.[76]
<p>The question was raised if the RP can be considered a legitimate democratic
party that unconditionally supported the existing secular regime, or if
it used the pluralist system and democratic methods only as a means toward
its ultimate goal of installing an Islamic Sharia’-based state in Turkey.
<p>RP’s ambiguous and tortuous policy over the issue of Islamic terrorism
in Turkey and Iranian involvement in it during the years 1990-1996 casts
some doubts about its genuine acceptance of the democratic values and the
secular regime. What probably most influenced the RP’s moderate and cautious
policies over the years has been the need to take in account the Turkish
army’s firmness in defending the Kemalist secular regime and to avoid a
direct clash with its secular nationalist core.
<p>This seems to have been also the strategy of the more violent, terrorist
groups of the Islamic movement. The Islamic terrorist groups never attacked
military or security personnel, although many of their members were killed
during the security forces’ anti-terrorist campaigns. Only low-level local,
mostly Kurdish, politicians have been killed by these organizations but
no top secular politicians. This contrasts with Egypt or Algeria, where
high-ranking military and police personnel or politicians involved in the
fight against the Islamic organizations have been one of their preferred
targets.[77] Moreover, Turkish Islamic groups did not attack Western targets
or act abroad, like other Islamic groups or the PKK, though they have some
infrastructure in Europe.[78]
<p>The main targets attacked were secular intellectuals and media professionals,
so important in defending secular values and shaping public opinion’s views
against the Islamic movement. The elimination of these personalities profited
all streams in the Islamic movement and did not seem to provoke a strong
reaction against terrorist groups and their political mentors, at least
until the assassination of Mumcu. Islamic groups attacked and threatened
Jewish personalities, the Jewish community and probably also Israeli diplomats.
By these actions they implemented the anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist aspect
of the extremist Islamic ideology. In this they were not different from
RP, which expressed antisemitic and anti-Israeli views in its propaganda,
its official economic platform, or by accusing Israel for murderous attacks
against secular personalities perpetrated by the Islamists themselves.[79]
<p>It can thus be hypothesized that even if there was no structural or
formal connection between the Islamic movement’s political and violent
streams, there was an objective ideological alliance and a <i>de</i> <i>facto</i>
cooperation between them toward achieving the goal of establishing a Turkish
Islamic state. It is quite clear that the RP leaders tried to cover up
the radicals’ violent practices but there is no published evidence about
the Islamic terrorist organizations’ attitude toward the RP’s role in advancing
and deepening Islam’s influence in Turkey and the relations with the main
Islamic party.
<p>The tolerance shown by part of the security establishment - especially
thoin the Ministry of Interior and the Police who came to senior positions
due to their Islamic views or connections - helped terrorist groups in
their formative period. It was another sign of the penetration of Islamic
influence in the secular security establishment. The top military echelons
were clearly worried by this trend and the threat of “reactionism” to the
military discipline and it seems that the uncovered attempt of one of the
police agencies to spy on the National Security Council fostered its decision
to confront the Erbakan government and force it to resign.[80]
<p>The decision of the Constitutional Court to outlaw the RP and its leader
upholds the firm position of the military and the secular establishment
in their approach to the <i>Refah</i> Party as a real threat to the regime,
although the sentence was based on political and legalistic grounds and
did not invoke any charge of supporting the violent or terrorist radical
activity.
<p>Iran’s radical anti-secular, anti-Zionist ideology explains the close
cooperation with the terrorist Islamic groups in Turkey. Commenting on
an anti-Turkish demonstration of Turkish Islamists in Tehran, an Iranian
daily claimed that the domination of secularism and Zionism are “the two
anti-Islamic platforms linked together in the artificial and short history
of Turkey” and that the Muslim people of Turkey has the right to protest
those who have imposed “these two flimsy and foreign ideas on their fates.”
According to the commentator, “Zionism’s increasing mischief, the inefficiency
of the broken arrow of secularism, the growing religious awareness of Muslims
and of political Islam in Turkey” permitted RP’s anti-alien, anti-Zionist,
anti-secularist policies to emerge, for the first time in 73 years, as
the main political party.[81]
<p>Riding on the Islamic anti-secular, anti-Zionist wave, the Iranian government
also achieved a more immediate tactical bonus by liquidating dozens of
Iranian opposition activists. The fact that part of the “dirty work” was
done by radical Turkish groups made the attacks more effective and made
it easier for the Iranian government to deny involvement in the killings.
At the same time, the Turkish terrorist organizations profited materially
from Iranian backing in training, logistical support, weapons and explosives
and a much needed safe-haven.
<p>Although Iran claimed Iranian-Turkish relations were optimal during
Ozal’s government, Iranian support to Turkish terrorist groups began as
early as 1987 and peaked in the early 1990s when he served as Turkey’s
President. It is more realistic to assume that Iran tried to take advantage
of the “Turkish-Islamic Synthesis” policy and Ozal’s government pro-Islamic
tendencies in order to accelerate the radicalization of the Islamic movement.
<p>The pressure on Turkey grew after the Gulf War, when Iran felt stronger
regionally, eager to counter-balance Turkey’s influence in Central Asia
and encouraged by the lack of reaction from the Turkish authorities, at
least until 1993.The weakening of the Islamic radicals and the RP’s strengthening
in the Turkish political arena, reduced Iran’s role, though it substantially
increased its support to the PKK guerrilla and terrorist activity.
<p>There is no doubt that the dramatic decrease in the terrorist activity
of radical Islamic groups is mainly a consequence of the determined counter-action
taken by the Turkish security forces beginning 1993 and the following years.
Yet, the lack of any major act of Islamic terrorism during Erbakan’s premiership
and until the decision of the Constitutional Court leaves us with some
question marks about the strategy of these groups and the real goals of
their leaders and sponsors.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>The Islamic fundamentalist movement in Turkey has many common features
with movements in many Muslim countries but, as we have seen, it has understood
the constraints and dangers of a direct clash with the nationalist Kemalist
ideology and, above all, with a military establishment sworn to defend
the secular regime and its values at all costs. The use of Islam by the
new intellectual and economic elite and military for their own political
needs - believing they could tame and transform it to be a pillar of the
regime - has been skillfully exploited by the Islamic movement in its bid
to achieve power and install an Islamic regime.
<p>This is also true regarding the more radical, violent off-shoots of
the Islamic movement. Their expansion and relative freedom of action was
tolerated on the same grounds until they became a real threat for internal
political stability. The RP’s parallel growth, electoral success, and its
leadership’s indulgence toward the Islamists’ terror has no doubt encouraged
and fed their violence. It is noteworthy that following Refah’s biggest
electoral success in December 1995 and until the resignation of Erbakan’s
government in June 1997, no serious terror acts were perpetrated by Islamic
groups, except low-level actions waged by IBDA-C, the most independent
of these groups.
<p>Despite exposure of its role backing the terrorist activity of Turkish
Islamic groups, Iran continues to support the PKK’s terrorist activity
while paying a very low price for it. Iran also welcomed the RP’s rise
to power. In exchange, Erbakan did his best to improve bilateral relations
and overlook its involvement in terrorist dealings.
<p>The resignation of Erbakan’s government under the army’s pressure, the
new government’s steps to curtail Islamic influence on the education system
and the outlawing of the RP have changed the “rules of the game.” The RP’s
leadership, Islamic radical groups and Iran will have now to re-evaluate
their strategy.
<p>The majority of the RP parliamentarians have chosen to take part in
the foundation of the new Islamic party, the Virtue Party (VP) and according
to the excerpts of its manifesto published in the press, it seems that
the leaders of the new movement have opted for a more moderate stand towards
the secular civilian-military establishment and the acceptance of the principle
of secularism as guarantor of freedom of religion and freedom of thought.[82]
It is not yet clear how the radical wing of the RP will react to this change
of strategy and what will be the path taken by those disenchanted with
it. The same can be said about those elements in the radical groups that
are still active underground, although they seem neutralized on the terrorist
operational level.
<p>Iran for its part, is entangled in an internal strife between the new,
more moderate policy proposed by the fresh-elected President, Khatami,
and the old revolutionary strategy sustained by the Spiritual leader, Khamene’i,
and the radicals who keep the key posts in the political and security establishment.[83]
The conflict between the two camps and strategies regarding the future
foreign policy of Iran has found an echo even in the Iranian academic circles,
which are well aware of the discrepancy between the regime’s ideology and
the constraints of the international and internal realities.[84] Here again
it is not clear which policy and strategy will prevail.
<p>Many politicians and columnists express the apprehensions in front of
the new entangled situation in Turkey. As the Istanbul’s <i>Sabah</i> put
it: “Will Iran take action in case of a possible crisis in Turkey? Will
it heighten the crisis? Will its special teams disrupt the balance? How
many Turkish citizens did Iran train for an Islamic revolution?”[85]
<p>Indeed one option open to the radicals in the Turkish Islamic groups,
the disillusioned RP militants and the Iranian regime could be, again,
the use of terrorism. For the moment only veiled threats are proffered.
The Turkish Daily News believes that Istanbul Mayor’s seemingly “declaration
of holy war against the secular state” does not have much resonance in
Turkey - not yet at least.[86] The Iranian press warns the Turkish leaders
that their country is situated in a region which is dominated by Muslims
and to turn its back to the interests of these Muslims for the safe of
their selfish [secular] designs and cooperate with Israel will eventually
bring them to face with these Muslim nations.[87]
<p>The messages emanating from radical Islamic elements abroad are more
plain-spoken. The <i>Muslimedia</i> Internet site, which follows the ideological
path of Kalim Siddiqui, “the spiritual father” and the unifier of the Turkish
Islamic Movement, maintains that the <i>Refah</i> experience demonstrates
the futility to change an anti-Islamic political system from within and
proposes to the Turkish radicals to follow the Iranian example and totally
reject the existing political order, “in deed as well as in word.”[88]
And the Hizb ut-Tahrir, the same organization that began the first Islamic
violent activity in Turkey in the 1960s, sent from London a menacing and
strongly worded “open letter” to the Turkish generals members of the NSC,
calling upon them “to be the harbingers to re-establish the rule of Allah...abolish
secularism...and [restore] the <i>Kilafah” </i>in order to save themselves
“from Hellfire.”[89]
<p>The question remains if the radicals will be ready to adopt the violent
confrontation strategy when it seems that the military and the secular
elite have abandoned all idea of the “Turkish-Islamic Synthesis” and decided
on an open and all-out war with the Islamic forces.

<font size=-1>IBDA-C’s monthly, <i>Taraf</i>, gives some addresses of its
representatives in Europe. In Germany there are several extremist Islamic
Turkish organizations. The most active is “The Islamic Communities Union”
led by Cemalettin Kaplan. See “<i>Islamischer Extremismus und seine Auswirkungen
auf die Bundesrepublik Deutschland</i>,” Bonn, Bundesamtfar Verfassungschutz
(November 1994).</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>According to Erbakan, Western “imperialist” institutions
and “Zionist Wall Street bankers” seek mainly to exploit Turkey and the
Islamic countries and Washington is the tool of “Zionist forces.” RP’s
politicians and daily newspapers have blamed the Jews, Zionism and Israel
for every domestic and foreign problem of Turkey. See Sayari, pp. 41-41
and <i>The Antisemitism World Report (1995),</i> p. 228.<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"></font></font></li>

Univ. and Dr. Javat Eta’at, the head of the<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</font>Research Division of the Center of Islamic Revolution Documents,
in Tehran <i>Salam</i> of 11 August 1997. It is interesting to note that
in this professional theoretical discussion on the Iranian foreign policy
Turkey is one of the very few countries mentioned by name and in this context
Dr. Eta’at proposes a policy to confront it and put it in a reactive position
by striving to a “reverse alliance” with one of its neighbors.</font></li>
