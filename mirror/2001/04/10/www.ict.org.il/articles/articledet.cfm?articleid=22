<p>
<P>The murderous violence practiced by Abu-Nidal’s organization. Fath -
The Revolutionary Council is guided by a specific ideology and world view.
Thus, the organization's operational activity need not obscure the fact
that its actions are intended to serve an idea, and indeed that its origins
and subsequent development lie in an ideological dispute between Abu-Nidal
and the Fath establishment

<P>The following survey explores the roots and content of that ideology.
It is based principally on the organization’s official weekly, <I>Filastin-a-Thawra</I>
(also the name of the publication of Arafat's PLO) and on interviews Abu-Nidal
has given to the Arabic and Western press since his break with the Fath
leadership in 1974. True, it is doubtful that Abu-Nidal himself was the
speaker in all these interviews, the later ones especially: it is quite
possible that someone else from the organization assumed his identity in
these cases. But whoever the actual speaker was, the fact that what he
had to say was published in <I>Filastin-a-Thawra</I> is proof that he was
speaking for the organization.

<P>Abu-Nidal's Fath sees itself as the true heir of the authentic Fath
which must be saved from the 'founding fathers' (Arafat and his cohorts)
who betrayed its heritage. Yet a return to the sources of Fath is urged
by Abu-Nidal not only in the name of ideological consistency but equally
as a relevant and realistic response to present problems. From this perspective,
Abu-Nidal’s Fath represents a model of a secular Palestinian fundamentalism
which seeks to restore the pristine past of Fath (i.e., the 1960s). But
it bears stressing that in shaping this model Abu-Nidal used his own personal
interpretation of the original Fath doctrine. According to Abu-Nidal, the
Fath establishment began to deviate from the true path (i.e., from the
imperatives of the <U>Palestinian Covenant</U>) when it adopted the 'phased
strategy' in 1974 which for the first time distinguished between a current
realistic goal (liberation of the West Bank and Gaza) and a more distant
ideal goal (liberation of all of Palestine). For Abu-Nidal this was Fath's
original sin, as it opened the way to a political process and a peaceful
solution of the Palestinian problem, while shunting aside the sacred goal
of the liberation of Palestine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Arabism of Palestine</FONT></B>
<BR>The liberation of Palestine has two aspects, according to Abu-Nidal.
Demographically, Palestine must be Arab in character, and geographically
the liberation must encompass the entire area between the Jordan River
and the Mediterranean Sea. In other words, the liberation of Palestine
and its restoration to the Arabs and to Arabism are two sides of the same
coin. Consistent with this outlook, Abu-Nidal and his journal emphasize
the pan-Arab dimension of the conflict with Israel and play down, to the
point of suppression, the particularist Palestinian aspect. Thus, for example,
in addition to Fath's traditional emblem, Abu-Nidal’s organization has
its own emblem, showing a map of the entire Arab world and not just Palestine.
The area of Palestine on the map is covered with a rifle, suggesting that
even though Palestine will be the fountainhead of the Arab world's salvation,
and that its revolutionary potential makes it the spearhead of the Arab
world, Palestine is still not everything. The struggle for Palestine, in
this view, is important not per se but as a vital link in advancing the
goals of the Arab world as a whole.

<P>In fact, the organization's literature pays scant attention to the idea
of self-determination for the Palestinian people (i.e., the Palestinians'
right to a political identity of their own) which is held sacrosanct by
the PLO and Arafat. Similarly, the concept of a democratic state in all
of Palestine is rarely mentioned in the literature or in Abu-Nidal's interviews.
Again, the explanation lies in the notion of Palestinian isolationism implicit
in these conceptions, and which is perceived as conflicting with the desired
aim of Arab unity. Even on the rare occasions when these ideas are mentioned,
they are interfused with the call for revolution throughout the Arab world.
For Abu-Nidal, then, a Palestinian state in all of Palestine is not viewed
as a sacred principle, but as an instrument in the service of pan-Arab
goals. Therefore Abu-Nidal can also profess allegiance to any idea, such
as 'Natural Syria' - which incorporates Palestine - that is consistent
with overall Arab liberation and unity. Abu-Nidal defines himself as 'first
and foremost an Arab fighter, for whom Palestine is one of the problems
of the Arab world, but not the whole problem'. It follows that the question
of Palestine is not a matter for the Palestinian people alone, but is a
vital interest of the whole Arab nation. It is no accident that <I>Filastin-a-Thawra</I>
often prints excerpts from the writings of the leading theorist of Arab
nationalism, Saati al-Husri A major theme in his writings (in the period
between the two world wars) was the Arabs' perpetual unity: the existing
divisions into states were dismissed as temporary and artificial.

<P>According to Abu-Nidal, the interrelation between the liberation of
Palestine and the realization of the Arab nation's goals exists not only
at the level of principle but is also a matter of practical programmatics.
In the operational realm, too, then, the process of the liberation of Palestine
is intertwined with the process of Arab unity. In this view, liberation
by peaceful means is rejected out of hand, even as part of the 'phased
strategy'; force is the only means recognized. However, since this goal
is beyond the reach of the Palestinians acting on their own, they must
seek the help of the Arab world. Ultimately, the conception is circular:
the intensity of the conflict with Israel will generate a process of unification
within the Arab world, and in the wake of this it will be possible to mobilize
all the Arabs' resources in order to uproot Israel and restore Palestine
to the fold of Arabism. Abu-Nidal sees his organization as the trigger
for this chain reaction. Programmatically, too, then, the two overriding
goals - unity and liberation - are intertwined and interdependent.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Dispute within Fath: The Historical Context</FONT></B>
<BR>Even though it was only following the 1973 war and the emergence of
the 'phased strategy' that the dispute between Abu-Nidal and Arafat erupted
in all its ferocity, its roots lie deeper and can be traced to the origins
of Fath. From the outset Fath was characterized by two contradictory ideological
currents which were, however, unequal in force. The dominant current, espoused
by Arafat, Abu-Iyad and Abu-Jihad evolved out of a refusal to accept a
situation in which the Palestinians would blend imperceptibly with their
Arab surrounding. This approach viewed the Palestinians' problems as separate
and unique and sought amelioration for them as such, albeit with the aid
of the Arab states. This particularist orientation did not reject Arabism
as a contributing factor to cultural identity, but politically it viewed
the Palestinians as a distinct entity. It was all but inevitable that this
current, which considered its primary task to be 'the self-assertion of
the Palestinian personality', should adopt the goal of the Palestinian
state and inscribe the ideal of self-determination on its banner.

<P>At the fringes of this dominant current was a somewhat nebulous core
group advocating a different ideological trend, whose leading figures were
Palestinians steeped in Ba'th pan-Arabism. Even after they joined Fath
they remained strongly influenced by Arabism. Both currents could coexist
as long as the accepted goal; the liberation of Palestine - obscured the
tension between Arabism and Palestinism. It was only under the banner of
the Liberation of Palestine that all the ideological currents could unite.
Occasionally the underlying conflicts surfaced, such as when Abu-Nidal,
deviatifrom Fath policy, publicly demanded Hussein's ouster in 1967-1969.
The enfeebled condition of the Fath leadership following 'Black September'
created an opening for the pan-Arabist circles to step up their pressure,
and in the third Fath Congress in 1971 they urged that the organization’s
ranks be open not only to Palestinians but to any and all Arabs. Although
this call was rejected, the pan-Arabists were able to influence the final
text of Fath's internal regulations, approved at the third Congress. It
is no coincidence that the Abu-Nidal faction is today calling on the established
Fath leadership to return to the principles of the 1971 regulations as
a binding ideological platform.

<P>The situation following the 1973 war aggravated the differences between
the two camps. The particularist orientation of the mainstream led it to
adopt the goal of a Palestinian state in part of Palestine even if this
entailed a political process, whereas the pan-Arab trend continued to advocate
the liberation of all of Palestine through a general Arab effort. It bears
stressing, however, that the pan-Arab trend was not organizationally cohesive
and did not present a unified front. Not all the former Ba'th members in
Fath followed its line. The point is illustrated by the careers of three
leading figures each of whom went his own way, even though each was powerfully
influenced by pan-Arabism: Abu-Nidal drew the political conclusion of his
viewpoint and rebelled against the Fath leadership as early as 1974; Samih
Ahu-Kwiyk (Qadri) remained in Fath ten years longer, becoming a member
of the Central Committee, but parted ways with the organization in 1983
to set up, with Abu-Musa and with Syrian backing, the Fath - Intifada organization;
Faruq Oaddumi continues to hold a senior position in the Fath establishment,
but his Ba'th heritage is apparent in his special attitude towards Syria
and his insistence on the centrality of Syria in the Arab world.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Enemy Camp</FONT></B>
<BR>For Abu-Nidal, the enemy camp comprises everyone who opposes the forceful
liberation of Palestine. The essence of a revolution is 'revolutionary
violence'; therefore, to adopt the title of revolutionary without also
adopting the path of an 'armed struggle' is a contradiction in terms. Together
with Zionism and Imperialism, a place of honor in this pantheon of infamy
is occupied by the 'agency of reaction' - i.e. those in the Arab world
supporting the political process, whether Arab regimes or Arafat's PLO.
In Abu Nidal's view the leaders of this camp - sometimes dubbed ‘Zionists
who are not Jews' - must be done away with, not only because they taint
the Arabism of Palestine but also because the net result of their stance
is to magnify divisions and erode the integrity of the Arab world. As far
as the Abu-Nidal faction is concerned, the sins of the PLO establishment
cannot be expiated: Arafat and his associates are guilty of transforming
the 'armed struggle' into a tactic in the service of a policy at total
variance with the Palestinian Covenant, which posits armed struggle as
its strategy. Arafat is also reviled for having dropped the goal of total
liberation in favor of a state in part of Palestine.

<P>In general, anyone tagged as an 'agent' (`<I>amil</I>) by Abu-Nidal
is marked for liquidation. In some cases the threats are indirect and cautionary,
such as when President Mubarak is called 'the head of the Sadati regime'.
But sometimes no punches are pulled; thus, for example, Abu-Nidal notes
that his organization has made the decision to liquidate King Hussein,
and that its 'natural task' is to depose Arafat. He is consumed with hate
for Gulf States such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. Public threats
of extortion are voiced against Kuwait, its rulers being warned that the
worst of all fates will befall them if they do not allocate funds to the
Abu Nidal faction either from their own sources or from the taxes they
collect from the Palestinians working in Kuwait. Kuwait is an Arab state
and we have prerogatives in it, is Abu-Nidal's explanation for this approach.
Those in his organization who are killed in the campaign against the internal
enemy - Arab and Palestinian 'reaction' - are considered martyrs just like
those who die in 'armed struggle' against the external enemies: Israel
and its supporters in the West.

<P>Abu-Nidal's declaration about the decision to liquidate King Hussein
is related to his fundamental conception that there is no substitute for
Jordan as an access route to 'the occupied land'. The organization’s journal
bluntly calls for Hussein's ouster and for establishment of a 'base of
concentration' (<I>qa'idat irtikaz</I>) in Jordan from which, in concert
with dissident Jordanians, the work of liberating Palestine can be accomplished.
Jordan, then, the first obstacle on the road to Palestine, and must be
the location of the first step. The de-Hashemization of Jordan is a necessary
prior condition for advancing the liberation and Arab unity. The organization's
literature and Abu-Nidal's interviews are replete with vilification of
Arafat's PLO and Fath establishment. Arafat is held responsible - together
with the US - for all the setbacks suffered by the Arabs in recent years.
The Fath leadership is often referred to as 'the treacherous Arafat-Wazir
(Abu-Jihad)- Khalaf (Abu-lyad) gang' (<I>zumra</I>). Responsibility for
the failure of the 'armed struggle' devolves on them alone - and not because
the struggle is ineffectual or because the Palestinians are no longer willing
to make sacrifices. That Faruk Qaddumi is absent from this list is no accident.
Because of his Ba'th past, his criticism of he Fath leadership, and his
conciliatory attitude towards Damascus, he seems to be regarded by Abu-Nidal
as having been temporarily 'led astray' but as destined to return to his
true origins. Asked his opinion of Qaddumi, Abu-Nidal has refused to condemn
him, but by contrast was unhesitant in his excoriation of Abu-Iyad. The
latter is a constant target of vilification because he was the first within
Fath circles to advocate publicly the 'phased strategy. Abu-Nidal's contempt
for Abu-Iyad is further heightened because the latter’s radical declarations
are taken as a pose.

<P>Thus, for Abu-Nidal it is Arafat's PLO which is anathema. For example,
he gives Syria exclusive credit for the achievements in the Lebanon War,
and even for the steadfastness (<I>sumud</I>) demonstrated in the siege
of Beirut; the part played by the PLO leadership is totally disregarded.
Nor is Abu-Nidal sparing in his comments about Na'if Hawatmeh and his organization;
they belong to the 'opportunistic left' and are barely distinguishable
from Arafat's camp of 'reaction'. Like Abu-Iyad, Na’if Hawatmeh is also
anathema in the eyes of Abu-Nidal because he was one of the conceivers
of the 'phased strategy', and zealously adheres to it to this day. It is
Hawatmeh who accords Arafat's leadership a 'leftist' veneer like “someone
driving an American locomotive with a red flag on it'. Abu-Nidal also adamantly
opposed to Hawatmeh's wish to heal the rift with Arafat if the latter dissociates
himself from the Amman Agreement with Hussein (February 1985).

<P>In contrast, when it comes to George Habash leader of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Abu-Nidal shows greater forbearance,
waiting for Habash to recant his support for the 'phased strategy'. For
Abu-Nidal, Habash is an 'Arab national symbol', and he still cites Habash's
1950s leadership of the “Brotherhood of Vengeance” (<I>Jama’at a-Th’ar</I>),
which sought to do away with the Arab leaders who bore responsibility for
the debacle of 1948. Indeed, a greater similarity appears to exist between
the Brotherhood of Vengeance, led by Habash and Wadiy' Haddad, and the
Abu-Nidal faction, than between the latter and the original Fath. Like
Abu-Nidal, the Brotherhood of Vengeance advocated the liberation of Palestine
as part of the unification of the Arab world, and it, too, did not balk
at the assassination of 'agents and traitors' among the Arab rulers.

<P>But force of circumstances compelled even Abu-Nidal to retreat from
his mode of confrontation with Arafat's . Instead of attacking from the
outside, Abu-Nidal in early 1987 moved to take part in the internal discussions
then underway among the Palestinian organizations with a view towards the
holding of the 18th PNC session. The rationale of this approach was to
bring about change from within, and more specifically to posit organizational
and programmatic conditions, which would implicitly assail Arafat's leadership.
This was a major departure for Abu Nidal, who used to regard even a show
of tactical flexibility as a shameful concession.

<P>However, the pressure of external circumstances seemed to leave him
with no choice. The primary reason was, as he himself said, the escalation
of the 'war of the camps' in Lebanon, which obliged him to join forces
with his arch-rivals in the PLO establishment against the Shi'it al-'Amal
movement and its Syrian prop. Abu-Nidal could not remain indifferent while
the inhabitants of the refugee camps, his organization's principal manpower
pool, were fighting for their lives. 'We fought in self-defense [in the
war of the camps]' - he explained - 'As members of this people which is
under murderous assault, it is our duty to defend them. We still do not
understand why our people face a threat of annihilation.

<P>Compounding the situation were Syrian measures to clip the organization's
activities in Damascus, bolstering the regime's effort to remove the stigma
of a state sponsoring terror. The falling out with Syria perforce brought
Abu-Nidal closer to the PLO. Moreover, recent developments, notably Arafat's
readiness spurred by his drive to expand ranks with the PFLP and the DFLP
- to abandon irrevocably his joint strategy with Jordan, and the support
for these efforts expressed by Libyan leader Qaddhafi, a close backer of
Abu-Nidal, led the latter to believe that conditions were ripe for engineering
a radical reorientation within the PLO. However, as might have been expected,
the Arafat leadership was not amenable to putting their collective head
on the chopping block. Indeed, Abu-Nidal's meeting with them, the first
since the death sentence they had passed on him in an internal trial in
1974, only accentuated the differences dividing them. Although the operational
cooperation in the Lebanon refugee camps continued, Abu-Nidal continued
to denounce Arafat's despotic leadership style. He also decried the resolutions
of the 18th PNC, which created opening for the PLO to join a political
process based on an international conference possessing full authority.

<P>It goes without saying that Israel and Zionism are also anathema to
Abu-Nidal. True, he pretends to distinguish between Zionism and Judaism,
maintaining that his enemies are the Zionists and not the Jews. However,
his operations abroad against targets identified with Israel (such as the
attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985) make no distinction
between Jews and Zionists, or indeed between them and anyone else. Moreover,
he attacks clearly Jewish targets such as synagogues. That a target is
Israeli is sufficient to warrant attacking anyone who happens to be there.
Asked about mass killings and indiscriminate attacks, the organization's
leaders reply that these are acts of self defense forced on them by the
indiscriminate aggression of Israel and the US. Similarly carrying the
'armed struggle' beyond the boundaries of Palestine to the international
arena is presented as a response to Israeli attempts to strike at Arabs
and Palestinians wherever they may be. Thus, for Abu-Nidal the distinction
accepted by Arafat's PLO between legitimate military operations within
Palestine and terrorism abroad is nonexistent.

<P>Unlike Arafat, Abu-Nidal is totally unconcerned about his international
image. One of the aims of his indiscriminate attacks is to discredit Arafat's
PLO and to inflame against him international public opinion, which does
not differentiate between Abu-Nidal and Arafat. In one outburst which seems
to reflect his true feelings, Abu-Nidal expressed a genocidal attitude
towards all Zionists, even those who may be ready to leave Palestine: 'It
is a crime to allow the Zionists to leave our land alive'. Abu-Nidal’s
interpretation of the 6th clause of the Palestinian Covenant, which limits
the number of Jews who will be permitted to remain in 'liberated' Palestine,
entails stripping the Jews of all rights, even as a religious community.
The sole criterion for the granting of rights whatsoever is, in this definition,
readiness to enlist in the Palestinian struggle for the liberation of Palestine.

<P>Israel's existence as a thorn in the Arabs' flesh will ultimately work
to their advantage by spurring them to unite in order to pluck it out.
Abu-Nidal rejects any attempt at differentiating among various groups in
Israel; even Rakah is beyond the pale as 'a Zionist Communist party' because
of its participation in the Knesset.

<P>Israel and its all-providing patron, the US, cannot be disentangled:
'Were it not for American support, the Zionist ghost would have long vanished
from the world arena'. The blighting American hand is ubiquitous. The ills
and divisions of the Arab world are the outgrowth of America's plots and
schemes. Abu-Nidal warns that he will pursue the United States relentlessly
and will seize every opportunity, however small, to harass it. He boasts
that he has already begun to shift the campaign to US soil. The leftist
forces in Western Europe are said to be his friends as long as they are
resolute in their anti-Americanism. The whole world is a stage for his
activity, and whoever fights his enemies is his friend and deserves cooperation,
be it the French terrorist organization 'Direct Action', the German 'Red
Army Faction', or the IRA.

<P>Among the countries of Western Europe, his sharpest hostility is reserved
for Britain, in no small measure because of his fierce hatred of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. His organization will bring about the downfall
of her government, he asserts. Although Abu-Nidal offers no explanation
of his special loathing for Thatcher, the reason is evidently her refusal
to release members of his organization who are imprisoned in Britain. A
recurring theme in his interviews is his commitment to do whatever he can
for his jailed associates. His thinking may be that such expressions of
loyalty will help attract new members to the organization and increase
their readiness to take risks, secure in the knowledge that the organization
will go far to secure their release if they are caught. Austria and Italy
are also singled out, as Abu-Nidal members are imprisoned there, too.

<P>Abu-Nidal's indignation against the West is presented as having deep
roots. Western culture is reviled because it posits material technological
development as the all-embracing ideal, but neglects 'the development of
the values, traditions and customs of humanity'. It is in Arab culture
that these spiritual qualities are to be found, and that culture is today
locked in a struggle with the West which is trying to divest it of its
virtues and infect it with its own materialistic hollowness. Moreover,
these values first flowered in the Arab world but decayed when they were
uprooted and replaced in the West. Abu-Nidal does not even balk at flaying
the Vatican for contaminating the values of Christianity - a salient 'Palestinian-Arab
creation' - with political goals.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Allied Camp</FONT></B>
<BR>Abu-Nidal is highly sensitive to the claim that his organization is
no more than a band of mercenaries up for hire by any Arab state. His constantly
reiterated theme is that his attitude towards any Arab state, and his readiness
to accept assistance from it, is based on a single unalterable criterion:
the strength of its determination to combat 'the Zionist enemy and American
imperialism' and its backers among the Palestinians and Arabs. Any about-face
in the stand of an Arab state on the conflict with Israel automatically
spells the end of cooperation with Abu-Nidal. As proof, he cites his own
move from Iraq to Syria; he himself did not change, he maintains, it was
the two countries that underwent changes and led him to distancehimself
from Iraq in favor of Syria. At all events, he insists, he alone selects
the organization's targets, without intervention from the host country.
If his objectives are congruent with the interests of the host country,
this stems from an objective meeting of minds and relations based on equality,
and not from pressures entailed in a patron-client relationship. To reduce
its dependence on Arab states, the organization declares that it strives
for economic independence. In pursuit of this goal, Abu Nidal's spokesman
has revealed, the organization has embarked on economic projects of its
own. Abu-Nidal perceives the dependence of Arafat's Fath on the pro-Western
Arab oil producers as a negative example which is to be avoided. This situation,
it is held, shows how economic reliance shapes ideological and political
stands. His peregrinations in the Arab world are consistent with his pan-Arabism,
according to which he feels at home everywhere in the Arab world, and with
his program, which is base d on enlisting the Arab states in the confrontation
against Israel.

<P>His current allies in the Arab Muslim world are Syria and Libya, followed
by Iran. For Hafez al-Assad, Abu-Nidal has only praise as a peerless leader;
under his guidance Syria is 'a firm bastion in the face of the Zionist-imperialist
state and a center for the Arab liberation struggle'. He notes with satisfaction
that the Syrians' drive for 'strategic parity' with Israel is at an advanced
stage and that it is destined to prove immensely fruitful. In his view
the centrality of Syria in the region is unassailable and he accepts the
concept of 'Natural Syria', even though this, if realized, would preclude
the establishment of an independent Palestine. This attitude towards Syria
is no mere sycophancy since, as noted above, Abu-Nidal's approach is based
on the principle and the practice of striving simultaneously for the two
supreme goals: liberation and unification. Qaddafi, too, is praised, but
manifestly Libya's distance from the principle arena of confrontation inevitably
makes it a factor of secondary importance as compared with Syria.

<P>Abu-Nidal is aware that there is no full contingency of interests between
his organization and Syria. There are certain things he is willing to overlook,
such as Syria's refusal to permit its territory to be used as a staging
area for operations against Israel, and its support for the Shi'ite Amal
organization in its efforts to eliminate the independent Palestinian presence
in Lebanon. But all these faults are atoned for, in the view of Abu-Nidal,
by Syria's emergence in the past years as 'the forward base of the Arab
revolution'. Thus, although Abu-Nidal never tires of stressing his opposition
to the Fez Plan, which for the first time set forth an Arab model for a
comprehensive peace with Israel, he turns a blind eye to Syria's acceptance
of the plan. For a long time he restrained himself and has also written
off Syria's offenses against the Palestinians in Lebanon, although in the
second half of the 1970s his organization sought revenge against the Syrians
under the name of 'Black June'. For Abu-Nidal it sufficed that on the central
topic of the confrontation with Israel and the US a complete accord existed
between him and Syria. He also needs the Syrians so that he can operate
in Lebanon and from it towards the Palestinians in the refugee camps and
against Israel. It is characteristic of Abu Nidal that where his allies
are concerned he evinces considerable tolerance for their diversified interests,
as long as these are perceived as secondary to his main goal. Even at the
height of the 'war of the camps', indeed even after the organization was
forced out of Damascus, Abu-Nidal refrained from attacking Syria directly.
As surrogates, he lashed out at two of Syria's lackies, the Shi'ite al
'Amal and Abu-Musa's Fath-Intifada organization.

<P>As regards the Gulf War, Abu-Nidal testifies to having expressed to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein his opposition to the Iraqi initiative which
sparked the conflagration. It is not the war of Arabism that Saddam Hussein
is waging against Iran, he believes, but his own private war. By contrast,
Arafat's PLO describes Iraq as the Arab national representative which is
defending its sacred soil against the Iranian invader. Although Abu Nidal
leans towards the Iranian side in the war, what he would really prefer
is a settlement, because 'the war has destroyed Arab and Islamic resources'.
While expressing esteem for Khomeini, he does not conceal his differences
with the Iranian leader. These stem from the latter's Islamic-oriented
principles, which dislodge Arab nationalism from its uppermost position.
Indeed, Abu-Nidal appeals to be intimating that he is apprehensive about
the broader ramifications of Khomeini's 'Islamic Revolution'.

<P>This would be consistent with Abu-Nidal's opposition to Islamic orientations
which threaten to usurp the place of Arabism. He has condemned the Muslim
Brotherhood as a 'reactionary band' which has nothing in common with 'Arab
geography, history or society'. Undoubtedly other factors are also at work
here, particularly the support of the Syrian-based Muslim Brotherhood for
Arafat and its opposition to the Assad government: Characteristically,
Abu-Nidal cites the ideological factor - the competition between Islam
and Arabism - as paramount. When it comes to Hizballah, however, ideological
disparities do not constitute an insurmountable obstacle. To the contrary,
the organization's weekly praises Hizballah's activity against Israel and
its dissent from al-Amal's operations against the refugee camps in Lebanon.
There, too, what tipped the scales was Abu-Nidal's need for with Hizballah
support in southern Lebanon.

<P>The Soviet Union is seen as a friend which supports the Arabs against
the US. Soviet support for Israel's existence is disregarded, but denunciations
of the Communist parties in the Arab world (including Hawatmeh's 'Democratic
Front') which follow Moscow's line are standard fare. As with Syria, Abu-Nidal
is tolerant of the Soviets' diversified interests, even though some of
them conflict with his own. He acknowledges the existence of compelling
circumstances which force him to make do with partial accommodation, and
warns against making demands on her which will expose his areas of discord
with Moscow.

<P>Although Abu Nidal has adopted the mantle of a 'socialist Arab nationalist',
his organization's organ and his own interviews are remarkable for their
lack of social content, let alone a radical socialist stance. The Fath
establishment is castigated as 'rightist', but he does not describe himself
as a 'leftist'. True, emphasis is placed on the populist aspect of his
outlook and he extols the latent potential in the 'Arab masses', as distinct
from the Arab regimes. But this populism is an outgrowth of nationalism
and not of a socialist philosophy. In this, Abu-Nidal is following his
master Saati al-Husri, whose one-dimensional outlook held that, like a
magic wand, Arab unity would banish all the ills of the Arab world.

<P>On the face of it, nothing could have been more natural than an alliance
between the Fath rebels under Abu-Musa and the Abu Nidal organization.
Both oppose Arafat, and both stress the pan-Arab dimension of the conflict
with Israel. But unity talks between the two groups in March 1985 quickly
bogged down. Ideological affinity does not necessarily engender cooperation;
indeed, it can generate competition for a separate right of existence.
The need to sharpen differences is especially strong in organizations with
much in common, especially if they are seeking support among the same constituency.

<P>At all events, relations between Abu-Nidal and Abu-Musa are at a nadir,
with Abu-Nidal making no secret of his contempt for the Fath dissident.
Abu-Musa, for his part, is fearful that his partner as leader of the rebels,
Oadri, is conspiring with Abu-Nidal in a plot to oust him. Abu-Nidal maintained
that he wished to unify all the anti-Arafat Fath dissidents, but his plans
went awry following the formation of the 'Salvation Front' incorpthe pro-Syrian
Palestinian organizations. Initially Abu-Nidal himself stayed out of the
Front so that he would not fall prey to Syrian diktats or become a tool
of Damascus. Among the leaders of the Salvation Front, in addition to George
Habash, Abu-Nidal has spoken respectfully of Ahmed Jibril as 'a modern
leader who represents an organization with great resources'. Clearly, Abu-Nidal
respects Jibril's professional abilities and would like to find avenues
of cooperation with him.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamic and Christian Symbols</FONT></B>
<BR>By birth Abu-Nidal is a Sunni Muslim, but his religious education is
meager in the extreme. Indeed, according to his biography his formal education
was confined to five years of elementary school in Mandatory Palestine,
three of them at the French Mission school in Jaffa, where he was born,
and two more years at a Muslim school in Jerusalem. His formal studies
ended with the outbreak of the 1948 war. He often likens his organization
to the Qarmatian movement (late 9th century) which Sunni Muslims consider
to have strayed from the true path of Islam and which is condemned to infamy
for violating the holy of holies and stealing the Black Stone from the
Kaaba at Mecca (930 CE) and holding it for twenty years. The point Abu-Nidal
wants to make in dredging up the Qarmatian movement is that like them,
his organization is marked by its clandestine character. Perhaps he is
also hinting that just as the Qaramatians threatened the Arabian Peninsula
in their day, his organization, too, is threatening to exploit the feebleness
of the Gulf states in order to sow chaos in them. Be that as it may, to
exalt the Qaramatians demonstrates an insensitivity apparently born of
ignorance; an observant Sunni Muslim would find Abu-Nidal's analogy abhorrent.

<P>Oddly enough, Abu-Nidal has evinced a lively interest in Christianity.
His efforts to defend Christianity against the Vatican, as noted above,
could have been written off as a curiosity were they not so consistent.
Thus, for example, the regular column in <I>Filastin a-Thawara</I> which
reports about the 'armed struggle in the occupied territories is always
preceded by a motto from the New Testament in which Jesus, 'the first Palestinian
Fida’I', is quoted as saying, 'He that hath no sword, let him sell his
garment and buy one'. When he has occasion to mention George Habash or
Wadiy' Haddad, Abu-Nidal never forgets to point to their Christianity as
one of their virtues, along with their Arab nationalism. Abu-Nidal's 'weakness'
for Christianity probably derives from his childhood education at the French
mission school in Jaffa. In the broader perspective, it was perhaps the
political need to imbue his organization with a general Arab thrust, supra-religious
and supra-communal, that caused him to draw on associations from his schooldays.
His desire to open the organization to every Arab, irrespective of religious
persuasion or ethnic extraction, also explains his reservations about the
domineering stance of Islam. In this, too, his approach follows that of
Saati' al-Husri.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Suicide Motif</FONT></B>
<BR>A perusal of Abu-Nidal's mouthpiece over the past two years shows that
the motif of suicide in the service of an idea has been imbued with a positive
content. (The Arabic term used is <I>`Istishad</I>, a religious term meaning
to give one's life in sanctification of Allah's name, as opposed to <I>`Intihar</I>.
referring to suicide in the wake of personal distress.) As a rule, the
positive references are not direct. A more overt reference appeared in
the weekly's description of the attack on the Rome and Vienna airports
(December 1985), when the perpetrators were termed 'suicide squads', thus
stressing their determination to execute their mission at any price, even
their own lives.

<P>Following the Rome/Vienna massacres, Mustafa Murad (Abu Nizar), Abu-Nidal's
deputy, termed such suicide missions 'acts of qualitative heroism', seeming
to welcome their transformation from sporadic individual exploits to a
generally accepted norm. Indeed, the perpetrators of the airport attacks
did not prepare an escape route. The rise of the suicide motif in Abu-Nidal's
organization appears to be inspired by the suicide attacks in southern
Lebanon in recent years and by Abu-Nidal's growing ties with Iran and Hizballah.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Exemplary Figures</FONT></B>
<BR>From the mists of Islamic history, Abu-Nidal evokes the figure of Salah
a-Din, defeater of the Crusaders, and seeks to emulate his recipe for success:
intertwining liberation with unification, the one act built upon the other.
From the more recent Arab past Abu Nidal draws inspiration from a number
of Arab and Palestinian leaders whom he reveres. First and foremost among
these is Abd a-Nasir, whom he calls 'the eternal leader', the subject of
several laudatory articles in the organization's journal. Nasir is praised
as heralding 'the national Arab awakening' and for coining the post 1967
phrase, 'What was taken by force will be returned by force'. The Fath establishment
is reviled for having dared to assail Nasir's leadership of the Arab world.

<P>In the Palestinian arena, Arafat's ignominy is contrasted with the glory
of Sheikh Izz-a-Din al-Qassam, who defied the approach of the traditional
leadership under the Mufti Hajj Amin al Husseini and fomented an uprising
in the north of the country before being killed by the British in 1935.
Several former Fath leaders are also extolled, notably Abu-Ali Iyad, who
was captured by the Jordanians during the bloody events in Jordan and tortured
to death; Abd al-Fath Hamud, who was killed in Jordan in October 1968 and
whose funeral in Amman became a demonstration of support for the PLO; and
Ahmad Abd al-Ghafur (Abu Mahmud), head of the 'National Arab Youth' organization,
who broke with Fath and was murdered by Arafat's messengers in Beirut (1974).
A foreign leader often cited is China's Chou EnLai, from whom Abu-Nidal
professes to have learned the importance of efficient organization and
management for the successful realization of an idea.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu-Nidal's Outlook on the Course of History</FONT></B>
<BR>Abu-Nidal maintains that his view of history derives from an unalloyed
perception of the constraints and incentives. It is he and not his critics,
he argues, who represents sober pragmatism: their road is 'nihilistic'
- his, 'realistic'. The central problem of the Arab world lies in the disparity
between its latent potential and its inability to realize that potential.
Only by exercising self-criticism and will power can the Arab nation move
forward. The Arabs' concentration on external constraints robs them of
the ability to summon the will power required to perform great and spectacular
deeds. There is nothing that can stand in the way of Arab will power. Abu-Nidal
acknowledges, however, that even if a positive change begins to emerge,
the Arabs will not fulfill their desires in a single, quasi-miraculous
act. The transformation entails a lengthy process which will have its ups
and downs. Most crucial is steadfastness, for Abu-Nidal is convinced that
ultimately 'the Zionist movement in Palestine' will disappear, however
long this may take. The Arab victory is certain to come, even if it seems
to tarry.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Symptoms of Mental Unbalance</FONT></B>
<BR>To judge from two interviews given by Abu-Nidal (assuming that he was
in fact the speaker) within a short time of each other in 1985, he is in
a state of high emotional tension and under intense pressure. He feels
that the whole world is conspiring against him. A striking case in point
is his repeated insistence that the Vatican is seething with dark plots
and is meddling in every corner of the earth. In this view the Vatican's
main purpose is to hunt down his organization, and he holds the Vatican
- rather than the US, for example - responsible for generating his fallout
with Iraq. His most bizarre claim is that the Vatican managed to slip Wadiy
Haddad poison and thereby caused his death. Nothing is said about the Vatican's
possible motive. For Abu-Nidal, then, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
are replaced by, as it were, 'The Protocols of the Elders of the Vatican'.
Frequently he injects into his interviews meaningor irrelevant comments;
attempts by the interviewer to clarify them are generally unavailing. Such
manifestations of mental unbalance are not frequent, but stand out because
of their novelty.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Protest of the 1967 Generation in the Refugee Camps</FONT></B>
<BR>Although Abu-Nidal's activity abroad is incomparably greater than in
'the occupied land', this does not necessarily reflect a preference for
the 'external' over the 'internal' arena. His journal deals extensively
with surveying the 'armed struggle' in the territories, crediting the Abu-Nidal
faction with operations that never took place or were carried out by others.
Clearly, he approves of such actions and attaches major importance to them.
The organization's interest in the territories extends beyond the 'armed
struggle' to every facet of life there. Thus, for example, in an official
statement the faction denounced in the strongest terms the appointment
of Zafir al-Masri as mayor of Nablus in place of 'the great patriotic fighter'
Bassam a Shaq’ah, and pledged to get rid of 'the double agent'. Evidently,
then, the difference in the faction's activity in the two arenas is related
to the fact that Abu-Nidal has thus far lacked a solid foothold in the
territories, since the majority of his activists are drawn from the refugee
camps in Lebanon.

<P>In Lebanon a great part of the young Palestinian generation which has
grown up since 1967 feels alienated and harbors a powerful craving for
vengeance - feelings rendered even more acute by the Lebanon War, the Sabra-Shatilla
massacre, 'war of the camps' between Amal and the Palestinians in Lebanon.
These young people find nothing to identify with in what seems to them
to be a sterile pragmatism of the PLO establishment. In contrast to Arafat,
Abu-Nidal offers them a simple, straightforward ideology based on internal
will power and free of objective limitations dictated by the balance of
forces on the ground. For the most part these are 'second grade' refugees,
i.e., those who were uprooted from the refugee camps in Lebanon and who,
in their despair, believe they can restore their self-respect by carrying
out spectacular attacks. They are receptive to catastrophic solutions which
take no account of the price they will exact, such as Abu-Nidal's call
for 'a third world war in the region’.

<P>The destructive Palestinian 'demon' which was partially exorcised by
the PLO establishment has resurfaced in a generation still young but already
steeped in disappointments and frustrations. Its motto might well be, 'The
worse things get, the better'. Abu-Nidal is able to recruit operatives
from this human reservoir and through them perhaps even ensure that his
radical message will continue to be heard after he himself disappears from
the scene.

<P>The escalation in quantity and method (mass attacks) which has characterized
Abu-Nidals activity since 1982 especially, may well be due to the radicalism
which has seized these alienated young people. The conditions spurring
this kind of militancy are not identical in the West Bank and Gaza, but
like Lebanon, the refugee camps there are liable to become a breeding ground
for the phenomena, with or without the aid of the Abu-Nidal faction.
