<br><i>An Analysis of the Principle Suspects</i></h2></center>

<p><p><b>The bin Laden track</b>
<br>As with most of the major terrorist attacks or attempted attacks against
American interests in the last two years, the main suspect in attack on
the USS Cole on October 12 is Osama bin Laden and his worldwide network,
known today under the name of al-Qaida. There are many factors to feed
this suspicion:
<ul>
<li>
As far back as 1996, bin Laden, in his now famous “<u><a href="http://www.webstorage.com/~azzam/html/declaration_of_war.html">Declaration
of War</a></u>,” emphasized the importance of Yemen—more specifically South
Yemen—for the radical Islamist struggle against the West and Israel. “The
presence of a population of fighters in the south of Yemen, fighting in
the cause of Allah, is a strategic threat to the Zionist-Crusaders alliance
in the area,” he wrote.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
His family is original from Yemen, where he is known to have resided for
some time. He has maintained strong ties with local radical movements and
tribal leaders. In March 1998, when the American authorities were already
pursuing him in Afghanistan, prior to the bombing attacks against the US
embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salam in August the same year, there were
reports that he and his followers intended to move to the Yemeni mountains
bordering Saudi Arabia.[1] The latest developments in the investigation
of the blast have led the trail to Hadhramaut, the Yemeni province, the
original home of the bin Laden family, and the birthplace of the young
Yemeni woman whom he lately married.[2]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In late 1992 bin Laden was involved in the bombings of hotels in Aden,
which hosted American soldiers en route to serve in the framework of the
United Nations troops in Somalia. Bin Laden confirmed this fact in an interview
with a Pakistani newspaper and boasted that “the US received the warning
and gave up the idea of setting up its military bases in Yemen.”[3]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Yemen served as a major command center for Egyptian Islamists and a communication
base between the militants in Egypt, and their leader in Afghanistan, Ayman
al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri is one of the main leaders of bin Laden’s network
and is even considered as his second-in-command. American intelligence
officials reported that they received reports in late May that the Egyptian
Islamic Jihad, a faction of which is closely associated with Osama bin
Laden, was in the final stages of preparing a terror attack against American
targets. A second warning, received in mid-September, spoke of a possible
attack against an American warship, but did not specify when or where.[4]
More recently, Refaee Ahmed Taha, a leader of the extremist faction of
al-Gama’a al-Islamyya has urged Egyptian Muslims to learn the lessons of
the USS Cole in Aden by launching attacks on U.S. interests in the Middle
East and in “the Suez Canal, which is crossed by tens of American and Jewish
ships.”[5]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In April 2000, a Yemenite citizen and two Pakistanis belonging to bin Laden’s
network were arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of preparing a terrorist
attack during President Clinton’s visit in Bangladesh.[6]</li>
</ul>
On 17 October, Osama bin Laden warned the US not to attack his home
in Afghanistan, where according to the Associated Press, fears have
grown of a retaliatory strike. Bin Laden
said an attack would not kill him and vowed to continue his battle
against the “enemies of Islam.” He made no direct reference to the
Yemen attack. On 16 October, the
Taliban government dismissed speculation that bin Laden was involved
in the bombing of the USS Cole.
<p>In an interview with CNN on October 19, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh said that his country had arrested “elements from Al Jihad returning
from Afghanistan.” It was unclear whether he was referring specifically
to the Egyptian group Islamic Jihad. When asked directly whether Mr. bin
Laden was responsible, Saleh said only, “It’s possible.”[7]
<P>If the bombing of the USS Cole was indeed an operation sponsored by bin Laden's network, it marks the first successful attack since the bombings of the American embassies in East Africa in 1998. 
<p><b>The Yemeni track</b>
<p>Two of the Yemeni Islamist groups suspected of involvement in the attack
on USS Cole are also known to have had contacts and cooperation with Osama
bin Laden.
<p><i>The Islah Party</i>,
<p>The Islah Party, or Islamic Reform Party, is an opposition party to
the regime of president Salah. The Party is deeply rooted in the powerful
Hashed tribal confederation in northern Yemen, whose military branch is
headed by Sheikh Abdul Mejid Al-Zindani. Yemen was a key source of manpower
for the “Afghan Veterans.” From 1984 until the end of the decade, Al-Zindani
sent between 5000 and 7000 Arabs, including Yemenis, to Afghanistan and
Pakistan via Saudi Arabia for military training and religious teaching
under his guidance.[8] Zindani himself fought in Afghanistan against the
Soviets alongside bin Laden, and his party is known to have contacts with
bin Laden’s organization. The fundamentalist al-Islah provided shelter
to returning fighters from Afghanistan and encouraged them to settle in
Yemen, where there has been an upsurge in Islamic action in recent years.
<p>The Islah Party is fiercely opposed to the granting of military facilities
to the US Navy. It condemned the use of the harbor of Aden by the Americans
in the period that it served the troops sent to Somalia. President Saleh
was angry at al-Zandani for warned him against any attempt to give the
American forces naval facilities on Socotra Island. Apparently, the warning
achieved its purpose. In an interview with the al-Jazeerah satellite television,
the president announced his refusal to turn Socotra into a military base.
Under an American-Yemeni deal, Yemen was promised $80 million and American
credit facilities for these facilities.[9]
<p><i>The Army of Aden-Abyan</i>
<p>This group has in the past attacked British and American targets in
Yemen. Its last known operation was the kidnapping of 16 Western tourists
in December 1998 with the goal of liberating its militants arrested by
the regime. During a rescue operation by the Yemenite authorities, three
British and one Australian tourist were killed and many of the militants—including
their leader, Zein al-Mehdar (<i>aka</i> Abu al-Hassan)—arrested. The organization
threatened to kill foreigners in Yemen if its leader al-Mehdar was executed.
In March 1999 the Islamic Army of Aden-Abyan issued what it called its
“final warning” to American and British ambassadors to leave Yemen, “otherwise
the strike will be painful for the enemies of Islam.”[10] However, al-Mehdar
was sentenced to death and after his appeal was rejected he was executed.[11]
on October 8, 2000, four days before the USS Cole blast, Yemeni security
forces arrested Ali Ahmad Haydarah, one of eight fugitives sentenced <i>in
absentia</i> during al-Mehdar’s trial.[12]
<p>These two groups include militants who fought or trained in Afghanistan
and could have given support to bin Laden to organize and perpetrate the
attack on the USS Cole, as well as the failed bombing of the British embassy
on October 13.
<p>However, these organizations have their own anti-American and anti-British
agenda, and have proved in the past that they were ready to attack these
countries’ citizens, soldiers and their interests in Yemen. The Army of
Aden-Abyan had particular grievances against the United States and Great
Britain, mainly after the execution of its leader. It is of note that al-Mehdar
was executed on October 17, 1999, almost one year at the day of the attack
on USS Cole.
<p><b>Claims of responsibility</b>
<p>Several militant groups have claimed responsibility for the blast but
none so far has been credible.
<p>One of these was Jaish Mohammed (Mohammed’s Army), a name previously
associated with a group known to be active only in Chechnya and Dagestan,
in Russia. It is curious that the claim of responsibility was received
by phone by Omar Bakri Mohammed, the leader of Al-Muhajiroun, a London
based militant group known for his ties with bin Laden.[13]
<p>However, in December 1999 Jordan arrested 13 suspects thought to be
linked to Osama bin Laden’s network and thus thwarted plans to carry out
a series of attacks on Jordanian territory. The leader of the group, Khader
Abu Ghoshar, and his 12 associates had received training in Afghanistan
on the manufacture and handling of bombs. He set up a group called Jaish
Mohammed, comprising veterans of the Afghan conflict, which was responsible
for several explosions in Jordan.[14] It is possible that this, rather
than the Chechnyan group, is the Jaish Mohammed claiming the attack on
the Cole.
<p><b>The state-sponsored terrorism track</b>
<p>Before analyzing the likelihood of a state-sponsored operation against
the American warship we should refer to the <i>modus operandi</i> of the
attack and the regional strategic importance of Yemen, and more specifically
of the Aden harbor.
<p><i>The modus operandi</i>
<p>The suicide sea-borne attack is a very rare method of attack by terrorist
organizations. Only the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) guerrillas have used it successfully,
in attacks against the Sri Lankan navy. They even have an identified ship,
the <i>Idayan</i>, a 2 crew, 45 knot fast attack vessel that can also be
converted for suicide operations (its militants employ the very latest
in “bomb suit” technology. A number of LTTE fighters have allegedly received
glider, micro-light and speedboat training in Europe and Southeast Asia
for “kamikaze” strikes.[15] The last sea borne LTTE attack was on October
23, when four rebel boats packed with explosives entered the Trincomalee
port. The navy managed to destroy three before they could cause much damage
within the strategic naval facility.[16] According to a Sri Lankan press
report, U.S. investigators are looking into whether LTTE rebels were involved
in the bombing of the USS Cole.[17]
<p>In the past Hizballah has tried to carry on suicide attacks against
Israeli warships patrolling near the Lebanese border, without much success.
During the 1980s the Palestinians, primarily Yasser Arafat’s Fatah, also
tried to stage sea-borne attacks from Cyprus, but were repelled by the
Israeli navy.
<p>Such an attack requires long preparation, technical and military skills
and good operational intelligence. American officials stated that on close
examination, the explosive used in the attack was more sophisticated than
initially thought. The penetrating force and the damage deep in the interior
strongly suggested that the bomb was a “shaped charge,” like a torpedo
or a missile, designed to focus the explosion rather than allow it to spread
in all directions, as with a typical truck bomb. Such a device is a more
sophisticated weapon than those used by most terrorist organizations, and
possibly came from a military stockpile.[18]
<p><i>The strategic background</i>
<p>Since the Cold War Aden has been considered an important military base,
from which naval forces can quickly reach the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf
and the Indian Ocean. The nearby island of Socotra has also been used as
a naval observation and intelligence collection post. The Gulf War in 1991
increased the importance of naval facilities in Yemen for American and
Western interests in the region. These facilities are used for the support
of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the small Gulf states in their conflict with
Iraq on the one hand and Iran on the other, as well as for the defense
of the strategic oil route.
<p>Aden provides not only a refueling port, but also an important naval
base for monitoring shipping routes in the region.[19] After the blast,
Yemeni sources stated that American warships, aircraft carriers and almost
10,000 marines would be arriving to Aden in the framework of the current
U.S. arrangements to establish a foothold in the Aden Gulf and establish
a permanent base at Aden and Bab al-Mandib straits.[20] In spite of the
denials of Yemen’s president, it seems that his administration has agreed
to allow U.S, military access to both a port and an airport on Socotra.
<p>In an article appearing in its October 23 issue, <i>Newsweek</i> claims
that U.S. intelligence has thwarted at least two other terrorist plots
directed at U.S. ships visiting ports in the Arabian Peninsula in the last
two years.[21]
<p><i>Iraq</i>
<p>Iraq is the most likely state to have the motivation, the stamina and
the means to organize the kind of terrorist attack that occurred in Aden.
<p>Saddam Hussein’s main goal is to terminate the international sanctions
against Iraq, the control by the United Nations on his weapons of mass
destruction and the U.S. and UK bombardments of Iraqi territory. He also
wishes to improve his stand in the Arab world—not only on the governmental
level but even more on the popular level—and to restore Iraq’s hegemonic
position in the Gulf.
<p>In September, Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil by drilling
at a slant along the border. Saddam also warned that he could attack “without
notice” Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because their rulers bombed Iraq.[22]
<p>The recent violence in Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the “Al-Aqsa
Intifada” provided him with an excellent opportunity to exhibit his bellicosity
and resolute support to the Palestinians, his allies during the Gulf War,
thus enhancing his popularity among the Arab and Muslim masses. In an October
3 speech he claimed that if Iraq were given an “adjacent small piece of
land” it could “put an end to Zionism in a short period of time.”[23] In
this framework he presented himself as the new Salah e-Din, the legendary
Muslim liberator of Jerusalem from the Crusaders. Iraq requested the Arab
League summit dealing with the crisis to declare a Jihad war against Israel.
Moreover, Iraq has moved elite troops west of Baghdad, probably in an attempt
to show Israel’s Arab neighbors that his threats are serious.[24]
<p>The day of the attack on the USS Cole the Iraqi government issued a
statement urging Arab states to liberate Palestine, but at the same time
asking them to regard America “as a participant in the aggression …and
therefore American military presence on Arab territories, waters and sky
should be banned.”[25]
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s Iraq was one of the main supporters of the
Palestinian terrorist organizations. The infamous Fatah - Revolutionary
Command (Abu Nidal) organization operated from Iraqi territory and with
Iraqi guidance until 1983. Iraq also hosted the 15 May (Abu Ibrahim) faction,
which attacked American planes at the beginning of the 1980s.[26] The gravest
Iraqi anti-American terrorist attack was the attempted assassination of
former United States president George Bush during a visit to Kuwait in
April 1993.[27]
<p>Interestingly, on October 14 a Saudi airliner was hijacked from Jedda
and finally landed safely in Baghdad were all the passengers were released.
The Iraqi authorities permitted to the two hijackers, although technically
under arrest, to stage an ad-hoc press conference where they voiced solidarity
with the sanctions-hit Iraq people. They also denounced the presence of
the US and British troops in Saudi Arabia. Even to an Egyptian newspaper
the Saudi hijacking appeared as an Iraqi coup.[28]
<p>It should be noted that Iraq has fairly good relations with Yemen and
probably also with the opposition parties, most of which are firmly opposed
to the Western embargo on Iraq and the American and British bombings on
its territory.
<p>As a country that has developed advanced weapons and has a history of
active involvement with terrorism, Iraq clearly has the means to give the
perpetrators of the attack on the USS Cole the necessary technical and
intelligence assistance.
<p><i>Iran</i>
<p>Iran was very active in international terrorism during the 1980s and
after the Gulf War. The Lebanese Hizballah was its main contractor in the
attacks against American, Israeli and Western interests in the Middle East
and around the world and has a rich history of suicide operations. In the
1980s the Iranians deployed mines in the Red Sea, the Straits of Hormuz
and lower Gulf area, in order to upset a cheap and effective route for
the international shipping of oil and confound the U.S. Navy’s protection
of the oil route.
<p>However Iran has been less involved in international terrorism since
the rise of president Khatemi to power in June 1997. The only exception
is its active support to Hizballah’s guerrilla and terrorist war against
Israel and the assistance to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in
their attempts to sabotage the peace process through suicide terrorist
attacks against the Israeli civilians.
<p>The on-going struggle for power between the reformist c, under the leadership
of Khatemi and the conservatives, under the guidance of spiritual leader
Khamene’i, has sparked off an violent internal clash, including the assassination
of intellectuals, trials of innocent Jewish citizens and arrests of reformist
journalists and politicians.
<p>On this background, it is not impossible that the conservative hard-liners
of the Iranian regime, those that still control the intelligence and terrorist
apparatuses, could try to sabotage any improvement in the relations between
the reformist government and the United States by staging a provocative
terrorist attack on an American target. These elements could also find
excuse for such an attempt in the explosive situation in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, which Iran is trying to exacerbate and transform into an all-Islamic
holy war against Israel.
<p><b><i>Summary</i></b>
<p>Although many facts have centered attention on Osama bin Laden and his
worldwide network, and many observers and journalists have pointed to him
as the main suspect, the American investigators have been very cautious
to hint at any specific conclusion or to specify what their evaluations
are concerning the perpetrators. However it should be kept in mind that
there are other “bad guys” in this region, Iraq being a salient one, and
the local Yemenite Islamist groups being possible sub-contractors for various
interested parties.
<p>Therefore, it is important to give the necessary time for such a sensitive
investigation to develop without the pressure of time, as it has potentially
serious political and operational consequences for the United States and
its strategy in the Middle East.

&nbsp; On August 11, 1982 an explosive device went off on a Pan Am flight
from Tokyo to Honolulu. The blast killed a passenger, wounded 16 others,
but landed safely. On August 25, 1982 a book-sized bomb was found under
a seat on board a Pan Am flight from Miami. On April 2, 1986 a bomb exploded
in seat 10-F of TWA flight 840, en route from Rome to Athens with 114 passengers
and 7 crew. Four passengers were sucked out from the plane, which finally
landed safely. The two August 1982 bomb attacks were perpetrated by the
May 15 faction, a splinter PFLP group. The TWA attack was attributed to
the Fatah Special Operations Group’s intelligence and security apparatus,
headed by Abdullah Abd al-Hamid Labib, alias Colonel Hawari. He reportedly
had used Palestinian terrorists who previously belonged to the May 15 Organization.
