<p>Israel’s speedy withdrawal from Lebanon and the collapse of the South
Lebanon Army (SLA) is certain to be studied by Hamas, the main Palestinian
Islamist organization. To understand what lessons Hamas may draw, it is
useful to look at two recent developments: discussion inside Hamas about
“Lebanonizing” the Palestinian territories and the early May arrest of
Hamas military commander Muhammad Deif by the Palestinian Authority (PA).
<p><b>‘Lebanonizing’ the Territories?</b>
<br>Statements of Hamas activists have focused on the need to “Lebanonize”
the Palestinian territories. In an unsigned article in the May edition
of the London-based monthly <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>, the main official
organ of Hamas, the movement published a special report on its terrorist
activity in the past two years, under the title “If Hamas operations in
the past two years would have succeeded, they would have created horror
in Israel.” The article described the development by Hamas of new kinds
of sophisticated weapons and remote-controlled devices, so as not to use
suicide bombing. One of the goals of these new self-made weapons was to
use them against Israeli patrols, such as in Lebanon. Another major attempt
was made to kidnap Israeli soldiers. In general, the article emphasizes
the wish of Hamas to develop guerrilla warfare against the IDF, a modus
operandi that could easily win the support of the Palestinian public.
<p>Following this article, <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i> published a series
of interviews with various Palestinian prominent figures, asking them,
“Is the resistance still possible in the shadow of peace?” The longest
and most emphasized interview was with Dr. ‘Abd al-’Aziz al-Rantisi, who
was just recently released from a long period of detention by the PA, and
who is number two in Hamas’s political hierarchy. Most of those interviewed,
other than Palestinian officials, praise the Lebanese model of resistance.
They argue that “the language of resistance is the only language understood
by the Israelis, and not the language of negotiations.” In other words,
the article raises a general sense among many Palestinians that they should
adopt the Lebanese model of resistance and move to a general armed struggle
of guerrilla warfare that will focus on Israeli soldiers rather than on
civilians. It is worth remembering that the name Hamas—Harakat al-Muqawamah
al-Islamiyyah, or the Islamic resistance movement—was first used by Hizballah
in the second half of the 1980s. The name was later adopted by the Palestinian
Muslim Brotherhood in December 1987, to mark the total change in their
policy toward Israel, from passive opposition to violent struggle.
<p>The Lebanese model could obtain the support of a relatively large proportion
of the Palestinians. This would be dangerous not only to Israel, but to
Yasir Arafat and his PA as well. Arafat and the Palestinian Security Services
may have been trying to block support for Lebanonization by arresting the
person who could lead such a struggle, and at the start of the process
rather than after it is too late.
<p>Another important issue that Hamas is admitting for the first time in
the article is the operational support Iran provides to the movement. The
article quotes reports in the Israeli press for the first time in the movement’s
written media, saying that the external command of Hamas tried to establish
a military wing in the territories by recruiting Palestinian students abroad.
These students were sent to an Iranian military college and trained in
various fighting techniques, using myriad weapons and explosives. They
were sent back to the Palestinian territories in separate stages, through
Jordan and over the Allenby Bridge, to use as special forces for commando
operations against the Israeli troops.
<p><b>The Arrest of Muhammad Deif</b>
<br>Muhammad Deif, the most wanted Hamas military commander of Hamas, was
arrested by the Palestinian Security Services in early May. Deif, a resident
of the Gaza Strip, was one of the closest aides of Yahya ‘Ayyash, “the
engineer” who was the commander of Hamas’s ‘Izz al-Din al-Qassam military
apparatus and was killed by a sophisticated Israeli bomb in January 1996.
The death of ‘Ayyash led to the division of the terrorist body: one part
in the West Bank, led by Muhi al-Din al-Sharif and the ‘Awadallah brothers
until all were killed in 1998; the other in the Gaza Strip, led by Deif,
who was considered the senior activist of the terrorist apparatus. Deif,
being responsible for the most bloody terrorist operations in Israel and
the Palestinian areas in the second half of the 1990s, was earnestly sought
by Israeli officials, who often voiced demands for his arrest. Israel also
regarded Deif’s arrest as an important test case for the seriousness of
the PA’s intentions to fight Hamas terrorism. The fact that Deif lived
for the past five years in Gaza, where he conducted the terrorist activity
of the Islamic movement, raised many questions in Israel. Gaza, unlike
the West Bank, is a closed area controlled by the Palestinians and is closer
to being an independent state.
<p>The general belief among the Israeli security and intelligence circles
in recent years was that the Palestinian Security Services had long tracked
Muhammad Deif but refrained from arresting him for political reasons. The
most important of these were the wish to keep him as a bargaining card
both with Israel and Hamas, his popularity among the greater Palestinian
public for being a symbol of revenge in the Israelis, and the possibility
of supervising Hamas’s terrorist activity through the surveillance of his
moves. In return, the Qassam brigades under Deif’s command refrained in
the past two years from using Gaza as a base for bloody operations against
civilians in Israel. The Qassam Brigades attacked only in the West Bank
or Jerusalem, mainly in those areas still controlled militarily by Israel.
<p>One of the reasons for Deif’s arrest may be found in the events that
led Israeli security forces to uncover a Hamas squad in the Israeli Arab
village of Taybeh last February. Deif sent this squad from Gaza and planned
for it to carry out at least three major suicide operations against Israeli
civilians. Arafat may have considered this squad a break of “the unwritten
rules of the game” between Hamas and the PA, rules that prevented the PA
from arresting Deif earlier. Another reason could be Israeli intentions
to capture or kill him, or reliable information given by Israel with regard
to his whereabouts, so the PA could no longer ignore his activity.
<p><b>Conclusions</b>
<br>Despite the setback from the PA’s arrest of Deif, Hamas may be able
to keep up or even step up its terrorist activities, thanks to the boost
in morale provided by the perception that Hizballah defeated Israel in
southern Lebanon. Whether Hamas will be able to carry out attacks will
depend to a considerable extent on whether the PA attests more Hamas military
activists.
