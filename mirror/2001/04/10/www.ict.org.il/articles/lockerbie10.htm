<TD VALIGN=TOP>December 21, 1998 marks the tenth anniversary of the explosion
of a Pan-American aircraft in the skies over Lockerbie in Scotland that killed 270 people.&nbsp;

<P>Today, ten years after the event, the Lockerbie Affair still refuses
to pass from the public agenda. More than merely a human tragedy, the incident
represents a milestone in the fight against international terrorism.&nbsp;</TD>

<P>The verdict of the Anglo-American investigative commission that Libyan
intelligence agents were behind the attack placed Libyan leader Muamar
Gadhafi’s regime in the center of a storm of international activity aimed
at punishing Libya for its responsibility for the disaster.

<P>Up until then—despite the fact that Libya’s involvement in international
terrorism since the 1970’s was blatant and well known—no effective
punitive action had been taken by the countries on the receiving end. Limited
military operations conducted by the Americans against Libya did not deter
her from terrorist activity. Quite the contrary; these operations increased
Libyan activity and support for international terrorism. Thus, the sinking
of two Libyan vessels in Sirte Bay by American planes (March 1986) lead
Gadhafi to order the revenge attack at the “La Belle” Discotheque in Berlin. 
This attack was the pretext for American punitive air strikes against Tripoli.
Gadhafi, for his part, retaliated by executing a murderous campaign of
terrorism over the next few years, the culmination of which was the downing
of Pan Am flight 103.

<P>The disclosure of Libya’s responsibility for the Lockerbie attack—in
addition to an attack on a French UTA airliner over Najar, in September
1989, which cost the lives of 170 passengers—provided the U.S., France
and England with the proverbial “smoking gun.” It enabled the US and Britain
to invoke the authority of the UN, leading to the imposition of comprehensive
international sanctions against Libya

<P>It should be noted that contrary to all expectations, it was the economic
and political sanctions imposed on Libya, and not the military actions,
that proved to be most effective. Since the imposition of the sanctions
in April 1992 Libya has ceased direct involvement in international terrorism
and has worked to suppress the activities of the terrorist organizations
operating under its auspices, such as Abu Nidal, the Japanese Red Army
and others.

<P>In the framework of his struggle against the Security Counsel sanctions,
Gadhafi has conducted a cunning campaign for the lifting of the political
and economic embargo on Libya. He also attempted to end the affair in such
a way as to save face and reduce the threat to his rule from within, while
at the same time disclosing as little as possible the involvement of his
regime in international terrorism.

<P>This campaign earned Gadhafi merely marginal gains, such as the demonstration
of his “endurance” in the face of the American and British demand that
the two suspects be handed over to their own juridical powers. The two
countries agreed to the trial of the suspects before an international court
at the Hague. Gadhafi occasionally managed to flout the embargo on air
travel to and from Libya; the flight of Libyan pilgrims to Mecca out of
Tripoli in 94, for example, and the demonstrative landing of the African
Union delegation in Libya.

<P>However one fact remains: the international coalition that coalesced
in the aftermath of the Lockerbie Affair succeeded in completely neutralizing
Libyan terrorist activity—activity that had been until then a byword for
the phenomena state-sponsored terrorism.

<P>We should remember that the fight against terrorism in general, and
against state-sponsored terrorism in particular, is complicated by the
individual, sometimes contradictory, interests of the countries involved.
This fight does not admit of “knock-out” victories, but only of victory
by “points,” the final score to be determined by the test of time.

<P>The relegation of Libya from her status of “pivotal player” to the sidelines
marks an unequivocal triumph for the Western alliance against international
terrorism. This achievement succeeded in reducing the scope of terrorist
activity in the nineties.

<P>The primary lesson to be learned from the outcome of this tragic affair
is that the only effective strategy against international terrorism—especially
state-sponsored terrorism—is by means of an international coalition working
in close cooperation. Only such a coalition is capable of imposing the
extensive economic and political punitive measures effective in deterring
the supporters and perpetrators of international terrorism. This lesson
is applicable too, to the present efforts against Iran, Sudan, and Afghanistan.
