<BR>Tel-Aviv University's Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism monitors
anti-Semitic manifestations of all kinds all over the world. It operates
a computerized database and publishes annual reports and special research
papers on specific aspects of contemporary anti-Semitism, bearing in mind
the problematics of defining and categorizing anti-Semitism in different
cultures and eras.&nbsp;

<P>This publication consists of two articles on anti-Semitic motifs in
the ideologies of two Islamic fundamentalist organizations, one Shi'ite,
the Hizballah, the other Sunni, Hamas. These organizations emerged in different
regions, under different circumstances and from different ideological backgrounds.
Nevertheless, they have much in common in their views of the West and modernization,
as well as Judaism, Zionism and Israel; hence we are publishing the two
articles together.&nbsp;

<P>The article on the Hizballah is broader in scope, exploring the movement's
attitude toward Israel and Judaism in the context of its emergence in Lebanon.
The second isolates anti-Semitic statements in Hamas leaflets and traces
their origins.&nbsp;

<P>Both articles are based on current material directed at, and probably
received by, a wide audience. This appears to be the case with the Hizballah
newspapers, which often quote speeches and sermons by the movements' leaders,
and is certainly the case for the Hamas leaflets, distributed as calls
to action among the population of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. However,
we have no way of evaluating the extent to which they influenced their
target audience or shaped their perceptions.&nbsp;

<P>Research on anti-Semitism in the Arab world is in its early stages in
the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism. We hope this publication will
be the first in a series of studies on this aspect of anti-Semitism.&nbsp;

<P>We would like to thank Prof. A. Shmuelevitz from the Department of Middle
Eastern and African History and a member of the Dayan Center for Middle
Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University for contributing a clear
and concise introduction to this paper.&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="INTRODUCTION"></A><B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<BR>In studying the attitudes of Muslims, and Muslim Arabs in particular,
toward Judaism, Zionism and the State of Israel, one cannot avoid dealing
with the question whether the term anti-Semitism is appropriate for defining
these attitudes.

<P>The concept anti-Semitism is derived from the Christian world and from
the theories of racism which emerged in it, and denotes an abiding negative
attitude rooted in theological, social and cultural preconceptions. In
contrast to anti-Jewish manifestations in European sources, expressed mainly
in religious and racist terms, anti-Semitic manifestations in Arab/Islamic
sources are mainly political in tone, and primarily associated with the
perception of Zionism and the State of Israel as secular national entities.
In fact, there is a high correlation between the development of anti-Semitism
in the Arab world and the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<P>The major manifestations of anti-Semitism in the Arab world today are
verbal, consisting of an extensive literature of anti-Semitic publications,
caricatures and translations of Western anti-Semitic books. Anti-Zionist
and anti-Israel writers and activists in the Arab/Muslim world today adopt
motifs from Christian anti-Semitic texts and give them Islamic connotations
derived from the traditional Islamic attitude toward the Jews.

<P>The emergence of Islamic fundamentalism in recent years has provided
a further impetus for this trend, with Muslim fundamentalists radicalizing
the demonization of Israel in Islamic terms. The Qur'an and the Muslim
tradition (<I>hadith</I>) are utilized in a process of rationalizing the
rejection of Zionism, Israel and the Jews in general.

<P>The actual positions against Israel and Zionism, advocating their obliteration
derive from the national territorial struggle and are not necessarily manifestations
or products of anti-Semitism per se. However, when they are buttressed
by an ideology that negates Zionists and Jews not only for what they do
but for a series of inherent negative features attributed to them, such
as craftiness, wickedness, greediness, they unquestionably become anti-Semitic.
The national conflict thus receives an additional dimension--a religio-cultural
one--that in the fundamentalist perception is historical and existential
and therefore irreconcilable.

<P>Nevertheless, it must be stressed that while anti-Semitism is a basic
tenet of these movements, it is by no means the central one, as it was
in Western racial and religious ideologies.

<P>Undoubtedly, this complex subject deserves current and fundamental academic
examination, for which the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism is recommended.
Its work in monitoring anti-Semitic activity and publications, analyzing
them and publishing its findings, constitutes a valuable contribution to
understanding Arab perceptions and motivations, that determine positions
toward Israel and the peace process during this period, on the threshold
of a new era in the Middle East.

<P><A NAME="FOREWORD"></A><B>FOREWORD</B>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A Word on the Emergence of Anti-Semitism in the
Arab World</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>There are many and diverse definitions of the term anti-Semitism, mostly
emanating from Christian writings and perceptions. Essentially, the term
denotes a persistent and profound negative attitude toward Jews that has
theological and psychological origins, exceeding other forms of ethnic
and racial prejudice. An expression is considered anti-Semitic when it
attributes certain unique and permanent characteristics to the Jews and
portrays them as an eternally evil force secretly plotting against both
God and mankind.

<P>Anti-Semitism did not exist in the traditional Islamic world. Jews under
Islam had the status of <I>ahl al-dhimma</I> (protected people), a discriminatory
status which guaranteed the safety of their lives and properties (as well
as those of other minorities) as a religious minority so long as they paid
the capital tax (<I>jizya</I>) and abided by the rules of Islam and the
restrictions imposed on them.<A HREF="#1a">1</A>

<P>Anti-Semitism is, in fact, a relatively new phenomenon in the Arab world,
gaining ground particularly since the eruption of the Arab-Israeli conflict
in the mid-twentieth century.<A HREF="#2a">2</A> Nazi-style anti-Semitic
books and publications have been published openly. For example, there are
at least nine different Arabic translations of the "Protocols of the Elders
of Zion,"<A HREF="#3a">3</A> which was translated into Arabic for the first
time in the 1920's. The argument that the Arabs cannot be anti-Semitic
since they themselves are Semites is irrelevant, not only because "Semite"
is a linguistic, not a racial or a national classification,<A HREF="#4a">4</A>
but because the term anti-Semitic has traditionally referred to Jews only.

<P>The development of European-style anti-Semitism in the Arab countries
is related to three major factors: first, the penetration during the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries of a variety of European ideologies and concepts
into the Arab world, amothem anti-Semitism; second, the collapse of traditional
political systems and of the loyalties and practices associated with them,
giving way to the emergence of nationalistic government structures less
tolerant in their treatment of religious, ethnic and ideological minorities;
and third, and most crucial, the development of the conflict over the domination
of Palestine, beginning with Jewish resettlement in the late nineteenth
century, followed by the establishment of the State of Israel and the ensuing
Arab-Israeli conflict.<A HREF="#5a">5</A> Themes borrowed from European
Christendom were adapted by incorporating explicit Islamic references in
them. The most important example of this process, according to Prof. Bernard
Lewis, was the restating of the story of Muhammad's relations with the
Jews. "Instead of being a minor nuisance, ineffectual and unsuccessful
in their plots against him," as they were traditionally depicted, "they
[the Jews] are depicted as a dark and evil force, conspiring to destroy
the Prophet, and continuing as the main danger to Islam."<A HREF="#6a">6</A>
Yehoshafat Harkabi calls this trend the "Islamization of the hatred of
the Jews."<A HREF="#7a">7</A>

<P>Hostility to the State of Israel and to Zionism as an ideology arising
from the Arab-Israeli conflict, while not in itself necessarily a manifestation
of anti-Semitism, gradually gave rise to a deeper, irreconcilable hatred
that does not differentiate between Israelis, Zionists or Jews.

<CENTER><A NAME="corollary"></A><B>ANTI-SEMITISM AS A COROLLARY OF ANTI-ZIONISM:
A BASIC TENET OF HIZBALLAH IDEOLOGY AS REFLECTED IN THE HIZBALLAH PRESS</B></CENTER>


<P>The relatively new phenomenon on the Lebanese political scene, Hizballah
("the Party of God") has gained worldwide attention during the, last ten
years because of its terrorist activity, its radical ideology, and its
unique relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran. This paper focuses
on one aspect of Hizballah's outlook--its attitude toward Israel, Zionism
and Judaism, examines its centrality in the movement's overall ideology,
strategy and behavior, and explores its development in the context of the
Shi'ite religious resurgence in Lebanon.

<P>The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 and the continued presence
of Israel in Lebanon played a prominent role in bringing Hizballah to the
forefront of Lebanese politics, and contributed to the organization's intense
preoccupation with the existence, nature, purpose and future prospects
of the State of Israel.

<P>Hizballah's total negation of Israel's existence is, on the face of
it, a natural extension of its negation of the West, especially the US,
inasmuch as Israel is perceived as a tool to realize American interests
in the region. However, this negation based on Islamic precepts portraying
Judaism as the oldest and bitterest adversary of Islam and intertwined
with anti-Semitic motifs, taken mainly from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni's
preaching and rhetoric, turns into a basic tenet in the movement's general
Islamic plan. It appears, therefore, that the line distinguishing between
anti-Zionism - the de-legitimization of Israel's right to exist - and anti-Semitism
- a primordial hatred of the Jews is becoming increasingly difficult to
define.

<P>Hizballah's attitude toward Israel and the Jews, entrenched as it is
in the movement's overall philosophy, predicates that the way to a new
Lebanon and Islamic revival passes through Jerusalem. Notwithstanding,
it should be emphasized from the outset that despite its anti-Semitic motifs,
this attitude is not the most significant tenet of Hizballah philosophy.

<P>Besides drawing from general publications as well as academic studies
of Hizballah, this paper is based on primary sources such as Arabic newspapers
and radio broadcasts, in particular al-Muntalaq, the monthly organ of the
Islamic Lebanese Students' Organization, which serves as an ideological
platform for Hizballah, al-‘Ahd weekly newspaper, both published in Beirut.

<P>Lebanese society and the Lebanese confessional political system were
based on a delicate balance between disparate groups, brought together
under the French Mandate in the 1920 's and later in the territorial state
that became independent in 1941. This entity consisted of enclaves inhabited
by Maronites, Sunni Moslems, Druze, Greek Orthodox and Shi'i Moslems in
the Biqa' Valley , and southern Lebanon The social and political balance
embodied in the constitution of 1926, stipulated by the French, and in
the national covenant of 1943 was designed to hold these groups together
through proportional representation in parliament, in political office
and in the civil service The gradual collapse of this balance after independence
led to instability and eventually to unrest and civil war.<A HREF="#1">1</A>

<P>This confessional system, whose abolition is one of Hizballah's main
objectives was blamed by the movement for the continuous injustice suffered
by the Shi'i community in Lebanon over the years. At the time of the establishment
of the Lebanese state, the Shi'i community was the third largest in size;
today it is considered the largest community numbering approximately 1.3
million. From the outset it suffered certain distinct disadvantages relative
to other communities: socioeconomic backwardness, a distrusted feudal political
leadership, and an attitude of indifference on the part of the government.<A HREF="#2">2</A>

<P>Growing social tension in the Lebanese Shi'i community over the years
converged with a change in the self-perception of Shi'ism from the 1960's
onwards, when its doctrine shifted from passivity to activism.<A HREF="#3">3</A>
This process culminated in the Iranian revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeyni,
which strove thereafter to expand beyond its territorial limits and penetrate
all Islamic schools of thought.<A HREF="#4">4</A>

<P>It is against this background that Hizballah emerged in the early 1980's
as an indigenous Shi'i movement inspired by the Islamic revolution in Iran
which arose as a reaction to adverse local conditions.

<P>The origins of Shi'i activism in Lebanon go back to the early 1960's,
shortly after the arrival in Lebanon in 1959 of a young cleric, Shaykh
Musa al-Sadr, who paved the way for changes that were to sweep through
the Lebanese Shi'i community.<A HREF="#5">5</A> Sadr, a disciple of the
new Shi'i activism emanating from Najaf and Qom (the two Shi'i religious
centers, in Iraq and Iran respectively), started preaching this creed shortly
after his arrival. He gradually gained influence in the Shi'i community
and in the Lebanese political scene in general. The first substantial sign
of the success of his efforts was the formation by him of the Supreme Islamic
Shi'i Council in 1967, which he has headed since 1969. This was followed
in the 1970's by the establishment of the first Shi'i political movement--the
Movement of the Disinherited (<I>Harakat al-Mahrumin</I>) - a grass roots
movement of social and political protest. By mid-1974, this movement had
developed into a military organization - Amal, an acronym for <I>Afwaj
al-Muqawama al-Lubnaniyya</I> (Lebanese Resistance Brigades), as well as
a word which means hope in Arabic. Sadr headed Amal until his mysterious
disappearance in August 1978, while traveling to Libya. Sadr sought to
bring about change in the Shi'i community through an evolutionary process
of reform of the eLebanese political system. He attacked the left, which
was gaining support among young Shi'is, as well as the established sociopolitical
order, using radical rhetoric and appealing directly to the masses. As
a Shi'i cleric he had a considerable advantage over leaders of other political
trends, granted a high degree of legitimacy by the Shi'i masses.<A HREF="#6">6</A>
His political agenda stemmed from his interpretation of faith. "Faith,"
as one Arab historian explained, "was not about ritual, but about social
concerns ... Religion was not something that had to be quarantined and
kept pure by stern guardians; it could be made to address modern needs.
Thus, the man of religion, Rajul al-Din, need not hide and solely concern
himself with old books and rituals, hilt should "bring back religion into
the social and political realm."<A HREF="#7">7</A>

<P>Sadr's disappearance in 1978 wreaked havoc in the ranks of Amal. With
no other figure to fill the leadership gap, personal rivalries and ideological
disagreements eventually divided Amal into two distinct groups: a secular
one, headed by Nabih Beri, and an increasingly more religiously radical
one - <I>al-Amal al-Islami</I> - headed by Husayn al-Musawi, both claiming
to faithfully represent Sadr's legacy.

<P>Sadr, elevated to the position of a hidden imam whose return is anticipated,
in accordance with traditional Shi'i belief, formally occupied the chairmanship
of the Supreme Islamic Shi'i Council until March 1994 and still symbolizes
the Shi'i awakening in Lebanon. Thus, the emergence of Hizballah in 1982
was a natural development resulting from the "convergence of Lebanese Shi'i
interests with Iranian foreign policy orientations," according to one scholar.<A HREF="#8">8</A>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="emergence"></A><B>THE EMERGENCE OF HIZBALLAH</B></CENTER>


<P>Hizballah is a radical Lebanese Islamic resistance movement whose ideology
combines a strong social message with a universal political goal and an
Islamic mission, to be realized by revolutionary means, i.e., <I>jihad</I>.
Within a few years, Hizballah attained moral and military hegemony in the
Lebanese Shi'i community, and more recently it has striven to achieve legitimization
in Lebanese society at large in order to fulfill its objectives.

<P>The name Hizballah is taken from a Qur'anic verse and means the "Party
of God" (see sura: The Table 56), reflecting the way the movement perceives
itself. "We in Lebanon," it states in an open letter regarded as its ideological
platform, "are not a closed organizational party nor a narrow political
framework. Rather, we are a nation tied to the Muslims in every part of
the world by a strong ideological and political bond, namely Islam."<A HREF="#9">9</A>
The name symbolizes both the broad identity which Hizballah seeks, and
the application of Khomeyni's ideal of replacing the Western concept of
the nation-state by a "<I>hizballah</I>," which would unite the entire
Islamic community of believers (<I>umma</I>) under the leadership of the
jurisprudent (<I>wilayat al-faqih</I>),<A HREF="#10">10</A> who is the
supreme religious authority. Theoretically, every Muslim is by definition
a member of Hizballah, but in fact the movement's adherents are mainly
Lebancse Shi'is.

<P>Three major events played a key role in mobilizing the resistance movement
and radicalizing the Shi'i community: the disappearance: of Sadr, the Israeli
invasions of Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, and the establishment of the Islamic
Republic of Iran. The last event, in particular, helped "heighten the political
consciousness of the Shi'ite community of Lebanon," according to one researcher,
and gave it a source of identity that "transcended national borders."<A HREF="#11">11</A>

<P>Hizballah started to operate in 1982 in the aftermath of the Israeli
invasion in June of that year, receiving help from Iranian revolutionary
Guards (Pasdaran) sent to Lebanon as part of Iran's attempt to export the
Islamic revolution. This force had arrived in Lebanon earlier to train
and indoctrinate Lebanese Shi'is.<A HREF="#12">12</A> Hizballa. began as
a loose network of military, political and social groupings,<A HREF="#13">13</A>
an arrangement that was later to lead to internal tactical controversy.
Nevertheless, the movement developed into a well-organized political entity
with broad popular support.<A HREF="#14">14</A> It is run by a consultative
council (<I>shura</I>) of 12 led by a secretary-general, with seven operational
departments in charge of diplomatic, military, social, intelligence and
information activities.<A HREF="#15">15</A>&nbsp; Most of the major decisions
are made by the council collectively and approved by Iran. Strict internal
discipline is imposed on the rank and file, who are expected to accept
clerical guidance in every aspect of life unquestionably, in accordance
with Shi'i tradition.<A HREF="#16">16</A>

<P>Establishing itself initially in the Biqa' Valley, mainly around the
city of Ba'albak where the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were stationed,
Hizballah soon moved into other areas heavily populated by Shi'is - West
Beirut and the south. In 1984 it took control of West Beirut, pushing aside
Amal, and after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 1985 began challenging
Amal's strongholds in southern Lebanon through a combination of violence,
intimidation and indoctrination as well as investment in developing various
social welfare services.<A HREF="#17">17</A> Militarily, it was initially
organized in small clandestine units, but these gradually turned into well-paid
semi-regular military forces. Today Hizballah maintains command centers,
training bases and a military force of approximately 5,000 fighters (mujahidun).<A HREF="#18">l8</A>

<P>Iran's backing and the Iranian presence in Lebanon played a crucial
role in the emergence of Hizballah. Iran continues to be its major supporter,
providing it with financial support, military training and a well-defined
set of politico-religious beliefs, reinforcing the movement with zeal and
with the experience of proven success.

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="ideology"></A><B>HIZBALLAH'S IDEOLOGICAL TENETS</B></CENTER>


<P>Hizballah assimilated the doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran totally
and pledged allegiance to its leader, Ayatollah Khomeyni, and his heir,
'All Khamaneh'i. The basic tenet of this doctrine is that Islam is a political
and social doctrine akin to Marxism or any other Western ideology, going
"beyond ethnic and regional orders and [offering] the best alternative
to solve people's problems."<A HREF="#19">19</A> Hizballah's ideology emphasizes
the Qur'anic origins of its political terminology, with its messages deriving
first and foremost from Shi'i themes and symbols, although it tries to
conceal its Shi'i leanings.<A HREF="#20">20</A>

<P>Hizballah's ideology revolves around several circles, beginning with
the inner circle, consisting of the oppressed Lebanese Shi'i community,
proceeding outward to Lebanese society at large, the entire Islamic world,
and finally encompassing the oppressed everywhere in the world. It has
both short-term and long-term objectives, which can be summarized as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
The abolishment of the confessional system in Lebanon and the transformation
of the country into an Islamic state with justice, equality, peace and
security for all through the application of the Islamic legal code (Shari'a);</LI>

<LI>
Resistance to nationalism, imperialism and Western arrogance and the liberation
of all oppressed Muslim peoples;</LI>

<LI>
Bringing about Islamic unity in order to transform Islam into a universal
power and establish Islamic rule; and</LI>

<LI>
Negation of Israel, and the liberation of Jerusalem and Palestine.<A HREF="#21">21</A></LI>
</OL>
The spirit of this ideology is reflected in the movement's emblem, which
features a raised arm bearing a rifle against the background of the globe,
with the slogan "The Party of God is Sure to Triumph" on top, and the motto
"The Islamic Revolution in Lebanon" at the bottom.
<CENTER><B>&nbsp;</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="demonization"></A><B>THE DEMONIZATION OF ISRAEL</B></CENTER>


<P>The liberation of Jerusalem and Palestine is perceived by Hizballah
as a major strategic target, essential for achieving Shi'i liberation in
Lebanon as well as for the realization of the ultimate goal: worldwide
Islamic rule. The conflict with Israel and the Jews is a total life-or-death
war, integral to three broader conflicts:
<OL>
<LI>
the conflict between "the arrogants of the world" (<I>mustakbirin</I>)
and "the downtrodden of the world" (<I>mustad'afin</I>);</LI>

<LI VALUE="2">
the cultural struggle between the West and the Islamic world;</LI>

<LI VALUE="2">
the historical struggle between Judaism and Islam.</LI>
</OL>
Israel is depicted as the product of Western imperialism and Western arrogance
in the context of the conflict between the West and the Islamic world.
The West, perceived as the source of evil, installed Israel in the region
in order to continue dominating it and exploiting its resources. Israel,
then, is the source of all evil and violence in the Middle East and an
obstacle in the way of Islamic unity, and it must therefore be eradicated.<A HREF="#22">22</A>

<P>The representation of Israel as a Western tool, foreign to the region,
constitutes a major theme in the writings, sermons and speeches of Hizballah
leaders and spokesmen, which are disseminated in the movement's press and
broadcast on their radio stations. It is also explicitly expressed in Hizballah's
platform. Israel is depicted as an "American spearhead" in the Islamic
world, "the ulcerous growth of world Zionism," and "a usurping enemy that
must be fought until the usurped right is returned to its owners. Israel's
final departure from Lebanon is a prelude to its ultimate obliteration
and to "the liberation of venerable Jerusalem from the talons of occupation.
"America, the first root of vice, its allies and the Zionist entity have
engaged and continue to engage in constant aggression against us and are
working constantly to humiliate us."<A HREF="#23">23</A>

<P>Israel is thus completely identified with the West, with the US “the
big Satan"<A HREF="#24">24</A> - and with Western culture, modernization
and moral corruption, which have caused all the maladies in the Arab and
Muslim worlds.<A HREF="#25">25</A> Both Jews and Americans are presented
as "the enemies of God and Islam"<A HREF="#26">26</A> and as "the Party
of the Devil" versus the "Party of God."<A HREF="#27">27</A>

<P>Often the aphorisms by Khomeyni and Khamaneh'i published regularly on
the back page of Hizballah's weekly al-'Ahd refer to Israel. Typically,
one such aphorism, attributed to Khamaneh'i, depicts Israel as "a cancerous
wound in the area, an imposed and oppressive entity, having no identity,
which ought to be uprooted."<A HREF="#28">28</A> Although the description
of Israel as a cancer is not new, the use of the adjective "cancerous"
in Hizballah publications was apparently originated by Khomyni<A HREF="#29">29</A>
and appears in various combinations, such as "cancerous germ"<A HREF="#30">30</A>
or "cancerous gland,"<A HREF="#31">31</A> all of which convey the uncontainable
and treacherous nature of cancer and the difficulty in uprooting it.

<P>Israel is also often described as racist, treacherous and barbarian.<A HREF="#32">32</A>
By establishing the State of Israel, according to Hizballah rhetoric, the
world has created a devil from which even greater evil will ensue, and
"the Israeli poison will spread and affect the entire World."<A HREF="#33">33</A>
Caricatures containing traditional Western anti-Semitic symbols are a widespread
means of demonizing Israel. Typically, Israel's alleged ruthlessness is
illustrated by a soldier with a long, crooked nose, long teeth and ears
and a prickly chin, wearing an armband with the star of David and a steel
helmet on his head, and holding a dagger dripping with blood.<A HREF="#34">34</A>

<CENTER><A NAME="difference"></A><B>BLURRING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZIONISTS
AND JEWS</B></CENTER>


<P>Hizballah spokesmen interchange the terms Zionism and Judaism, and Zionists
and Jews, freely. In an interview, Husayn Fadlallah, the most senior religious
authority of Hizballah, explained the difference between Judaism and Israel
thus: Judaism, like Christianity, is a religion that is recognized by Islam.
Islam calls for a dialogue with the Jews, as with the Christians, since
they are "the people of the book" (<I>ahl al-Kitab</I>). But, "there is
something called Israel," which is a manifestation of "the Jewish movement,"
and it aims at occupying Islamic lands. Using as an excuse that this land
was promised to them by God and that they had lived there thousands of
years ago, the Jews expelled the people who lived there. This is "political
Judaism, defined as Zionism," and it constitutes aggression against all
Muslims, since it uses force and oppresses others."<A HREF="#35">35</A>

<P>Fadlallah proceeded to support these views with Qur'anic references
to the corrupt, treacherous and aggressive nature of the Jews. "We find
in the Qu'ran that the Jews are the most aggressive towards the Muslims,
not because they are Jews or because they believe in the Torah but because
of their aggressive resistance to the unity of the faith. They reached
an agreement with the idolaters to fight the prophet Muhammad, Fadlallah
asserted; they are known as the killers of the prophets; they spread corruption
on earth; and they oppress other peoples."<A HREF="#36">36</A> The idea
that those most hostile to the faithful are the Jews and the idolaters
is a theme which appears repeatedly"<A HREF="#37">37</A>

<P>Fadlallah and other Hizballah spokesmen do not see any contradiction
in presenting Islamic sources as displaying tolerance toward the Jews,
on the one hand, and as exposing the Jews' wickedness, on the other. These
same sources, according to Hizballah ideologists, also provide the reasoning
behind, and the motivation for, the irreconcilable struggle between Islam
and Judaism, which is viewed as the struggle between truth and falsehood,
and good and evil. The Hizballah fighters wage war on Israel out of religious
belief and conviction, "just as they pray and fast--it's God's order to
them."<A HREF="#38">38</A>

<P>Israel is a state that emerged in the heart of the Arab nation in order
to revive "the Jewish persona" through Zionist racism in confrontation
with all Muslims.<A HREF="#39">39</A> "Either we destroy Israel or Israel
destroys us."<A HREF="#40">40</A> A further dimension is added to the abiding
enmity between Islam and Judaism in the utilization of Western anti-Semitic
images and perceptions of Jews. "The Jews are the enemy of the entire human
race."<A HREF="#41">41</A> "Zionism dictates the world and dominates it."<A HREF="#42">42</A>
"The Jews constitute a financial power ... They use funds to dominate the
Egyptian media and infect its society with AIDS."<A HREF="#43">43</A> "The
Torah inspires the Jews to kill."<A HREF="#44">44</A>

<P>The conspiratorial and racial character of Zionism is developed extensively
in the analytical articles that appeared in the movement's monthly, al-Muntalaq,
during the period under review. According to this publication, world Zionism
cooperated with the secretive Masonic order in order to dominate the World.<A HREF="#45">45</A>
The Jews view themselves as the chosen people, which is the source of their
racism and their condescending attitude to other peoples.<A HREF="#46">46</A>
The origins of the Jewish image in Western societies are described at length
as further proof of the universally negative perception of the Jews. One
of the articles refers to Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice,
and to the definition of the word "Jew" that appears in French and English
dictionaries as the symbol of "deceit, hypocrisy, treachery, exploitation,
cheating and hatred of others."<A HREF="#47">47</A>

<P>Fadlallah, in another interview, is quoted as saying:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Jews want to be a world superpower. This racist circle
of Jews wants to take vengeance on the whole world for their history of
persecution and humiliation. In this light, the Jews will work on the basis
that Jewish interests are above all world interests. No one should imagine
that the Jews act on behalf of any super or minor power; it is their personality
to make for themselves a future world presence.<A HREF="#48">48</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet, despite their seemingly invincible power, "the Zionists are also cowardly
and meek."<A HREF="#49">49</A> Even if it takes another century, Islam
will emerge victorious, as it did in the twelfth century when it banished
the Crusaders who had occupied Palestine for two hundred years, and as
it did by spiritually overpowering the descendants of the savage Mongols
who had conquered the Islamic territories in the thirteenth century.<A HREF="#50">50</A>

<P>Close scrutiny of outpourings of anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic sentiment
by Hizballah activists reveals that they occur more frequently on certain
occasions, as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Memorial days for the fallen (the "martyrs") killed as a result of Israeli
military operations in Lebanon, such as that held annually in February
for Shaykh Raghib Harb, observed by the entire movement. It was on this
occasion in 1985 that Hizballah's platform was first read out at a mass
rally in the form of an open letter.</LI>

<LI>
Following Israeli military operations. The abduction of Shaykh 'Abd al-Karim
'Ubayd in July 1989, the killing Shaykh 'Abbas al-Musawi in February 1992
and Israeli strikes at Hizballah bases in southern Lebanon in retaliation
for ambushes of Israeli soldiers in the Israeli security zone, unleashed
an outpouring of emotion expressed in numerous speeches, articles and radio
commentaries. These included such epithets as: "wicked enemies of God and
Mankind," "villains," "Zionist gang, "blood-thirsty Zionists," "the most
cowardly of God's creatures."<A HREF="#51">51</A> Similar reactions followed
Operation Accountability in July 1993, attempting to instigate war by reiterating
that Hizballah consists of "followers of martyr Husayn ... the sons of
the blood revolution of Karbala" (the battle in 680 in which Imam Husayn
Ibn 'All was martyred).<A HREF="#52">52</A></LI>

<LI>
Regional and international political events relating to the Middle East
and specifically to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The holding of the multilateral
peace talks in Madrid, the invalidation of the UN resolution equating Zionism
with racism, and the decision of the Palestinian National Council to join
the peace talks were vehemently denounced, with Hizballah issuing special
statements on these occasions, reiterating depictions of the "conspiratorial,
conceited and obstinate" character of the Jew, who should never be trusted.
The peace conference was labeled a "Satanic plan, and peace with the "Israeli
enemy" was equated with "peace with crime, treachery, barbarism and racism."<A HREF="#53">53</A></LI>

<LI>
Religious, especially Shi'i, holidays. When Hizballah terrorist activity
is plotted on a graph, the curve soars during the 40 days following '<I>Ashura</I>,
the Shi'is' holiest day, commemorating Imam Husayn's martyrdom, which became
a symbol of Shi'i oppression and later of Shi'i activism and is observed
by demonstrations and self-flagellation,<A HREF="#54">54</A></LI>

<LI>
Jerusalem Day. A commemorative holiday fixed by Khomeyni in 1980 (see below).</LI>

<LI>
During parliamentary elections. In presenting their political platform
during the election campaign in 1992, Hizballah candidates made frequent
references to the conflict with Israel and the Jews, including inflammatory
anti-Semitic allusions such as "parasitic entity," "the Zionist culprits,"
and "the struggle with the Jews is a struggle for Islamic survival."<A HREF="#55">55</A></LI>
</OL>
Several Lebanese and American Jews were taken hostage by Hizballah in the
first couple of years of the organization's activity, and some Lebanese
Jews, among them the head of the community, Isaac Sasson, were accused
of being Israeli spies and executed during 1985/1986. It would appear that
their primary guilt was in being Jews who continued to live in the Muslim
quarter of Beirut after 1984, when Hizballah forces gained control over
it, or, in the case of foreign hostages, having Jewish names.<A HREF="#56">56</A>
<CENTER>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="jerusalem"></A><B>JERUSALEM - THE BUILDING OF A MYTH</B></CENTER>


<P>The holiness of Jerusalem and its importance to Islam assumed mythical
dimensions in the Arab world and especially in the Islamic Fundamentalist
movements after the Six-Day War of 1967. This trend received further impetus
from the Iranian Islamic revolution, which adopted Jerusalem as a political
symbol, stressing its religious importance to all Muslims.<A HREF="#57">57</A>

<P>For Hizballah as well, the liberation of Jerusalem is perceived as the
essence of the resistance effort, with the struggle for Lebanon merely
a stage on the road to the redemption of Jerusalem.<A HREF="#58">58</A>
Hizballah zealously adopted Jerusalem Day, which was fixed as an Islamic
holiday by Khomeyni in 1980, a year after he seized power in Iran, on the
last Friday of the month of Ramadan.<A HREF="#59">59</A> The day is commemorated
by Hizballah with marches, demonstrations and mass rallies. It is known
as "the day of Islam" or "the day of Islamic revival," when every Muslim
must prepare himself for the confrontation with Israel.<A HREF="#60">60</A>
Jerusalem Day gained the status of other religious Islamic holidays such
as "the day of the battle of Badr" (in 624, a battle won by Muhammad which
symbolizes the victory of a minority over a majority), "the night of Mi'raj"
(the night of Muhammad's ascent to heaven), and 'Id al-Fits (the last day
of Ramadan).<A HREF="#61">61</A>

<P>Two Hizballah military units were named for Jerusalem - the Jerusalem
Brigade in Ba'albak and the Division of the Liberation of Jerusalem.<A HREF="#62">62</A>
An entire issue of <I>al-Muntalaq</I> was dedicated to Jerusalem in 1991,
covering historical, religious and political aspects."<A HREF="#63">63</A>
Numerous articles traced the origins of the city's holiness and its importance
to the Muslims. Jerusalem was presented as an Islamic cause manifested
in light of its "Islamic historical glory."<A HREF="#64">64</A> It is also
perceived as a unifying factor, thereby playing an essential role in Hizballah's
pan-Islamic ideology.

<P>Jerusalem is consistently viewed as a unique symbol which spans all
political trends and religious schools of thought in the Muslim world.
Its status is of concern to the entire Islamic nation and is perceived
as a reflection of that nation's strength or weakness.<A HREF="#65">65</A>

<P>Historically, Jerusalem is the first <I>qibla</I> (direction of prayer),<A HREF="#66">66</A>
the site of the al-Aqsa Mosque, and the third holiest city after Mecca
and Medina.<A HREF="#67">67</A> Emotionally, it is a concept capable of
mobilizing the masses of the Islamic nation and a banner around which they
can rally and start taking charge of their own destiny.<A HREF="#68">68</A>
According to Husayn Fadlallah, Jerusalem was, is and will remain the axis
of the jihad movement for all Muslims. However, because they adopted foreign
ideologies, the Arabs mistreated Jerusalem over the years and related to
it solely as a geographical region, ignoring its religious sanctity. In
his view Jerusalem is the essence of the Islamic strategic plan, which
aims at the revival of Islam and the retrieval of the lost pride and dignity
of the Islamic nation.<A HREF="#69">69</A> For this reason, Fadlallah declared,
it must be kept ever-present in the mind.<A HREF="#70">70</A>
<CENTER>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="conclusion1"></A><B>CONCLUSION</B></CENTER>


<P>Hizballah acquired its theoretical basis including its attitude toward
Israel and the Jews front Khomeynism. Ayatollah Homeyni, together with
Fadlallah, "gave a practical and activist form" to those Qur'anic, verses,
and the <I>hadith</I>, relating to "the struggle against culprits and unbelievers,"
according to one commentator.<A HREF="#71">71</A> "Their view of the conflict
derives from a deep understanding of the Qur'an and history."<A HREF="#72">72</A>
Khomeyni also drew on traditional Shi'i attitudes toward the Jews, which
viewed them as unclean, impure and corrupt infidels and treated them with
overt contempt.<A HREF="#73">73</A> He referred to the impurity of the
Jews in his books<A HREF="#74">74</A> and laid down rules for dealing with
them, although apparently Hizballah chose to ignore this argumentation
in their statements, speeches and articles on the Jews.

<P>Hizballah is completely opposed to Jews and Judaism and stresses the
eternal conflict between them and Islam, although it also cites the more
tolerant aspects of Islam toward the Jews. The movement calls to distinguish
between Judaism and Zionism, but at the same time reinforces its anti-Zionism
by reviving the ancient Islamic enmity toward the Jews, revealing that
essentially there is no separation between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.

<P>Hizballah's brand of anti-Semitism is yet another addition to the emerging
phenomenon of Islamic anti-Semitism, and is typical of the fundamentalist
Islamic movements generally"<A HREF="#75">75</A>, combining traditional
Islamic perceptions with Western anti-Semitic terminology and motifs to
express its opposition to Zionism. Zionism, in turn, is equated not only
with the State of Israel but also with imperialism and with Western arrogance.

<P>Hizballah has been making efforts to reconcile three disparate elements
in its ideology - the pan-Islamic, Shi'i and Lebanese. It has come to recognize
that political, social and economic conditions, whether 1ocal, regional
or international, affect ideology and dictate change. example, it appears
that the movement is modifying its tactics in the domestic Lebanese arena.
By participating in Lebanon's parliamentary elections, allowing the deployment
of the Lebanese army into southern Lebanon, and functioning within the
existing political system Hizballah has displayed a greater awareness of
its Lebanese identity, seeing no contradiction between Lebanese nationalism
and the Islamic revolution. Its attitude towarIsrael and Judaism, however,
remains unchanged. It is consistent and inflexible, even though Hizballah
spokesmen acknowledge the movement's practical limitations in the event
of an all-out war. Fadlallah even admitted that "Israel has now become
an undisputed fact on the international scene, whether we like it or not,"<A HREF="#76">76</A>
yet victory over Israel is still the first step toward the achievement
of a perfect society and a perfect individual, in the Hizballah view.<A HREF="#77">77</A>
The idea of the eradication of the State of Israel symbolizes the universal
pan-Islamic aspect of Hizballah's ideology and the first target in the
struggle against the West. Moreover, the volatile political situation in
southern Lebanon, the peace negotiations, and the prospective changes in
relations between Israel and the Arab states have pushed Israel as an issue,
and hence anti-Semitic manifestations as a corollary, to the forefront,
causing these to receive a greater share of exposure than their actual
importance in the overall philosophy of Hizballah would warrant.

<CENTER><A NAME="motifs"></A><B>ANTI-SEMITIC MOTIFS IN HAMAS LEAFLETS,
1987-1992</B></CENTER>


<P>Since the outbreak of the Intifada in December 1987, the leadership
of the various Palestinian organizations in the West Bank and the Gaza.
Strip have utilized leaflets as a means of disseminating ideas anti conveying
operational instructions to the population. These leaflets drew considerable
attention both from the Israeli authorities and from scholars, who published
several studies on the subject,<A HREF="#78">78</A> although none focused
on the anti-Semitic aspects of the leaflets.

<P>The following article pinpoints anti-Semitic terminology and motifs
contained in the Hamas leaflets, distributed during five years of Intifada.,
and traces their origins. The material was compiled from the available
original Hamas leaflets; from Shaul Mishal's book, <I>Stones are Not All:
The Intifada and the Leaflets as a Weapon</I>, which provides a Hebrew
translation of the leaflets distributed during the first year of Intifada;
and from <I>Falastine al-Muslima</I>, Hamas' Arabic monthly organ published
in London.
<CENTER><B>&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="hamas"></A><B>THE HAMAS IDEOLOGY</B></CENTER>


<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement (<I>Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya</I>),
known by its acronym Hamas, is an Islamic fundamentalist organization which
defines itself as the military wing of the Muslim Brethren. The word hamas
also means devotion and zeal in the path of Allah. The movement, Palestinian
by origin, has as its main objective "the liberation of Palestine - the
land and the people - from the Israeli occupation and the establishment
of an Islamic Palestinian state."<A HREF="#79">79</A> It sprang from the
Muslim Brethren movement, which was active in the Gaza Strip since the
1950's and gained influence through a network of mosques and various charitable
and social organizations, until the 1980's, when it emerged as a powerful
political factor, challenging the influence of the PLO. In 1987, facing
a growing threat to its status from the Islamic Jihad (<I>al-Jihad al-Islami</I>)
organization, and under pressure from younger activists, it adapted a more
nationalist and activist line and embarked upon a new religio-national
course under the name of Hamas.<A HREF="#80">80</A>

<P>In November 1988, Hamas published a <U><A HREF="h_cov.htm">covenant</A></U>
which was an attempt to systematically present the movement's ideology,
in contrast to the PLO covenant.<A HREF="#81">81</A> It presents the Arab-Israeli
conflict as the epitome of an inherently irreconcilable struggle between
Jews and Muslims, and Judaism and Islam. It is not a national or territorial
conflict but a historical, religious, cultural and existential conflict
between "truth and falsehood,"<A HREF="#82">82</A> the believers and the
infidels, in which one side will eventually be the victor. The only way
to confront this struggle is through Islam and by means of jihad (holy
war), until victory or martyrdom. "The time will not come until Muslims
will fight the Jews [and kill them]; until the Jews hide behind rocks and
trees, which will cry: Oh Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, come
on and kill him!”<A HREF="#83">83</A> This ideology is represented in the
movement's emblem, which shows the Qur'an and a sword. Reflecting this
point of view, the Hamas leaflets were the most vociferous of all leaflets
distributed by the Palestinian organizations during the Intifada and contained
the most extreme anti-Semitic statements against Jews, Israelis and Zionists.
<CENTER>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="terminology"></A><B>TERMINOLOGY</B></CENTER>


<P>The terminology used against the Jews in the leaflets is a mixture of
Western anti-Semitic and Islamic rhetoric. Some of the anti-Semitic expressions
appearing repeatedly in the leaflets are:

<P>"The brothers of the apes, the killers of the Prophets, blood suckers,
warmongers,"<A HREF="#84">84</A> "barbaric,"<A HREF="#85">85</A> "cowards,"<A HREF="#86">86</A>
"cancer expanding in the land of Isra' [reference to Palestine which was
the destination of Muhammad's night journeyl and Mi'raj [Muhammad's ascent
to heaven] threatening the entire Islamic world,"<A HREF="#87">87</A> "a
conceited and arrogant people,"<A HREF="#88">88</A> "the enemy of God and
mankind,"<A HREF="#89">89</A> "the descendants of treachery and deceit,"<A HREF="#90">90</A>,
Nazis,"<A HREF="#91">91</A> "spreading corruption in the land of Islam,"<A HREF="#92">92</A>
"the Zionist culprits who poisoned the water in the past, killed infants,
women and elders,"<A HREF="#93">93</A> "thieves, monopolists, usurers."<A HREF="#94">94</A>

<P>Verses from the Qur'an and the <I>hadith</I> (the traditions associated
with Muhammad passed down by his companions) were used often to reinforce
the negative image of the Jews, and terminology with Islamic connotations
was dominant. The leaflets usually began with the religious invocation:
"In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compa.ssionate." Almost every
leaflet contained a Qur'anic verse either as a heading or as a conclusion,
emphasizing a certain feature inherent to the Jews, is instigating war.
For example: "Oh believers! take not the Jews or the Christians as friends."<A HREF="#95">95</A>
"So make war on them: By your hand will God chastise them, and will put
them to shame, and will give you victory over them, and will heal the bosoms
of a people who believe."<A HREF="#96">96</A>

<P>Further reinforcement of Islamic motifs in the leaflets was achieved
by means of:
<OL>
<LI>
Issuing the leaflets in commemoration of an Islamic holiday such as 'Id
al-adha (feast of the sacrifices concluding the: Hajj), or Ramadan (the
month of the revelation of the Qur'an, a month of fasting for all Muslims);
of a historic event such as the battle of Badr (a battle won by Muhammad
in 624, symbolizing the victory of a minority over a majority); or of an
event in the recent history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, such as the Six-Day
War of 1967 or the Balfour Declaration (2 November 1917).</LI>

<LI>
Calling for action, such as a general strike, a demonstration or a day
of fasting and prayer, on historic days such as the conquest by Muhammad
in 628 of Khaibar (an oasis in the Arabian Peninsula where a Jewish settlement
had existed, symbolizing the defeat and the so called "treacherous" character
of the Jews, who were involved in an alliance against Muhammad to invade
Medina from Khaibar) or the Battle of Hittin (in 1187, where the Crusaders
were defeated by the Muslims).</LI>

<LI>
Addressing the public as descendants of heroes in the history of Palestine,
e.g.: "Oh descendants of Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi (the Muslim commander who
led the battle against the Crusaders at Hittin) or: "Oh descendants of
Abu Ubeida Ibn al-Garah" (one of Muhammad's companions who died in battle
in Palestine in 638).</LI>

<LI>
The Qur'anic verses, the names of Muslim heroes, and other references from
the early history of Islam were meant to speak to all sectors of the population.
They constitute the most universal language in the Arab world, best understood
by, and most efficient in mobilizing, the masses.</LI>
</OL>
Western anti-Semitic terminology, also used extensively in the leaflets,
is generally confined to describing the crimes of the Jews and the Zionists
in the territories and throughout the world. The Jews are accused of conspiring
not only against Islam hut against the whole world for their own benefit.
They manipulated the world wars, the world economy and the drug trade,
invented communism, and so on, as described in the "Protocols of the Elders
of Zion."<A HREF="#97">97</A>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%"></CENTER>

<CENTER><A NAME="nuance"></A><B>MINOR CHANGES IN NUANCE</B></CENTER>


<P>An analysis of the leaflets shows no significant changes in the anti-Semitic
attitudesof Hamas during the period under review, although several minor
changes are noteworthy. The first few leaflets seem to have served as a
platform for introducing beliefs and objectives of the movement, and contain
numerous references to the Jews, reflecting the extremist stance toward
them. Gradually, the leaflets became more operational in nature, although
they still contained a variety of anti-Semitic statements.

<P>Harsh terminology regarding Jews reached a new peak in October 1990,
following the clash on the Temple Mount between Israeli forces and Arab
worshipers that resulted in a number of dead and wounded among the Arabs.
This incident was cited in a leaflet as additional proof of the Jews' evil
intentions to tear down the al-Aqsa mosque, in order to reestablish the
Jewish Temple (<I>Beit Hamikdash</I>).<A HREF="#98">98</A>

<P>The Gulf crisis became the main issue in the leaflets that follow, reflecting
the preoccupation of the Palestinian population and the entire region with
this controversial series of events. Anti-Semitic allusions continued,
but with a shift in emphasis. There was now a new, aggressive crusade,
the product of an American Zionist conspiracy backing Israel as the representative
of the West and Western culture, to threaten the Muslim heritage and culture.
Zionism was an imperialist tool installed in the region in order to undermine
the Islamic world.<A HREF="#99">99</A>

<P>Similar attitudes were expressed in relation to the peace initiative,
and the Madrid conference, described as an American scheme to strengthen
the State of Israel in the heart of Arab territory. Moreover, it is claimed
that the land of Palestine is a (religious endowment) property belonging
to all Muslims, and as such no one has the right to give lip even one inch
of it or engage in negotiations leading to surrender.<A HREF="#100">100</A>
Once the land of Palestine is retrieved, it is claimed, the Jews will be
allowed to live under Muslim rule not as a political entity, which they
are not according to the Hamas view, but as a religious community with
certain rights, as in the past. To support this view, they point out that
historically the Jews had their golden age under Muslim rule.<A HREF="#101">101</A>

<P>&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<CENTER><A NAME="conclusion2"></A><B>CONCLUSION</B></CENTER>


<P>The Hamas ideology and Hamas terminology are neither new nor unique
to this particular movement, but are characteristic of several of the ideological
and political trends prevailing in the Arab world since the advent of the
Arab-Israeli conflict in the 1940's. More recently they have come to typify
the Islamic fundamentalist movements active in Muslim as well as non-Muslim
countries The anti-Semitic component is integral to this ideology and deeply
rooted in its Islamic origins. Yet naturally it holds a more prominent
place in the outlook of the Hamas, as the representative of the Palestinian
people and directly involved in the struggle against the Jews over the
land of Israel. Therefore the anti-Semitic rhetoric in Hamas leaflets is
frequent and intense. Nevertheless, anti-Semitism is not the main tenet
of Hamas ideology. Generally no differentiation was made in the leaflets
between Jew and Zionist, inasmuch as Judaism was perceived as embracing
Zionism, although in other Hamas publications and in interviews with its
leaders attempts at this differentiation have been made. The Hamas did
not change its stance or views in the light of the peace process. It continues
to staunchly oppose this process and to wave the banner of resistance against
Israel.

for the Soul of Lebanon</I>, (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1987).</FONT>
<CENTER><B>Our Story with World Arrogance</B></CENTER>


<P><B><I>Honorable, downtrodden men,</I></B>

<P>As for our story with world arrogance, we shall sum it up for you in
these words: we believe that the struggle of principles between the United
States and the Soviet Union ended forever a long time ago. The two sides
have failed to achieve happiness for mankind because the idea they have
offered mankind, though assuming the different forms of capitalism and
communism, agrees in material content and fails to deal with the problems
of mankind.

<P>Neither western capitalism nor eastern socialism has succeeded in establishing
the rules of the lust and serene society, nor have they been able to establish
a balance between the individual and society or between human nature and
public interest.

<P>The two sides have mutually recognized this fact and have realized that
there is no more place for ideological struggle between the two camps.
They have both turned to struggle for influence and interest; hiding from
public opinion behind the mask of disagreement on principles.

<P>In the light of this understanding, we believe that the ideological
struggle between the two camps has been folded forever and been replaced
by the struggle for influence and interests between the countries of the
arrogant world that are led today by America and the Soviet Union.

<P>Consequently, the oppressed countries have become the struggle bone
of contention and the oppressed peoples have become its fuel.

<P>While we consider the struggle between the two superpowers a natural
outcome of the material content that motivates each of them, we cannot
agree to have this struggle conducted at the expense of the interests of
the downtrodden and the expense of their wealth and rights.

<P>Therefore, we stand against any western or eastern imperialist intervention
in the affairs of-the oppressed and of their countries and we confront
every ambition and intervention in our affairs.

<P>While denouncing America's crimes in Vietnam, Iran, Nicaragua, Grenada,
Palestine, Lebanon, and other countries, we also denounce the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, the intervention in Iran's affairs, the support for Iraqi
aggression, and so forth.

<P>In Lebanon and in the Palestine area, we are mainly concerned with confronting
America because it is the party with the greatest influence among the countries
of world arrogance, and also with confronting Israel, the ulcerous growth
of world Zionism. Therefore, we are concerned with confronting America's
allies in NATO who have gotten embroiled in helping America against the
area's peoples. We warn the countries that have not gotten involved yet
against being dragged into serving American interests at the expense of
our nation's freedom and interests.

<P><B>Israel Must Be Wiped Out of Existence</B>

<P>As for Israel, we consider it the American spearhead in our Islamic
world. It is a usurping enemy that must be fought until the usurped right
is returned to its owners.

<P>This enemy poses a great danger to our future generations and to the
destiny of our nation, especially since it embraces a settlement oriented
and expansionist idea that it has already begun to apply in occupied Palestine
and it is extending and expanding to build Greater Israel, from the Euphrates
to the, Nile.

<P>Our struggle with usurping Israel emanates from an ideological and historical
awareness that this Zionist entity is aggressive in its origins and structure
and is built on usurped land and at the expense Of the rights of a Muslim
people.

<P>Therefore, our confrontation of this entity must end with its obliteration
from existence. This is why we do not recognize any cease fire agreement
any truce, or any separate or nonseparate peace treaty with it.

<P>We condemn strongly all the plans for mediation between us and Israel
and we consider the mediators a hostile party because their mediation will
only serve to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Zionist occupation of Palestine.

<P>Therefore, we reject the Camp David treaty, the [King} Fahd plan, the
Fez plan, the Reagan plan, the Brezhnev plan, the French-Egyptian Plan:
and any plan including even tacit recognition of the Zionist entity.

<P>We underline in this regard our condemnation of all the deviant countries
and organizations that chase after capitulationist solutions with the enemy
breathlessly and that agree to "barter land for peace." We consider this
a betrayal of the Muslim Palestinian people's blood and of the sacred Palestinian
cause.

<P>On the other hand, we view the recently voiced Jewish call for Settlement
in the Lebanon and the Immigration of the Ethiopian Jews and others to
occupied Palestine as a part of the expansionist Israeli scheme in the
Islamic world and as an actual indicator of the danger emanating from the
recognition of or cootistcnce with this entity.

<P><B>Escalating Islamic Resistance</B>

<P>When speaking of usurping Israel, we must pause before the phenomenon
of Islamic resistance that sprang from the occupied Lebanese territories
to impose a new historic and cultural turn on the course of the struggle
against the Zionist enemy.

<P>The honorable Islamic resistance that has inscribed and continues to
inscribe the most magnificent sagas against the Zionist invasion forces,
that has destroyed by the faith of its strugglers the myth of invincible
Israel, that has been able to place the usurping entity into a real dilemma
as a result of the daily military, economic, and human attrition it inflicts
on this entity, forcing its leaders to acknowledge the severe resistance
they face at the hands of the Muslims. ...

<P>This Islamic resistance must continue, grow and escalate, with God's
help, and must receive from all Muslims in all parts of the world utter
support, aid, backing, and participation so that we may be able to uproot
this cancerous germ and obliterate it from existence.

<P>While underlining the Islamic character of this resistance, we do

<P>so out of compatibility with its reality, which is clearly Islamic motive,
objective, course, and depth of confrontation. This does not at all negate
its patriotism, but confirms it. On the contrary, if this resistance's
Islamic character were effaced, its pwould become extremely fragile.

<P><B>Appeal for Broad Islamic Participation</B>

<P>We take this opportunity to address a warm appeal to all Muslims in
the world, urging them to share with their brothers in Lebanon the honor
of fighting the occupying Zionists, either directly or by supporting and
assisting the strugglers, because fighting Israel is the responsibility
of all Muslims in all parts of the world and not lust the responsibility
of the sons of Mount 'Amil and Western al-Biqa'.

<P>With the blood of its martyrs and the struggle of its heroes, the Islamic
resistance has been able to force the enemy for the first time in the history
of the conflict against it to make a decision to retreat and withdraw from
Lebanon without any American or other influence. On the contrary, the Israeli
withdrawal decision has revealed real American worry and has formed a historic
turning point in the course of the struggle against the usurping Zionists.

<P>Hamas is one of the links in the Chain of Jihad in the confrontation
with the Zionist invasion. It links up with the setting out of the Martyr
Izz a-Din al-Qassam and his brothers In the Muslim Brotherhood who fought
the Holy War In 1936; it further relates to another link of the Palestinian
jihad and the jihad and efforts of the Muslim Brothers during the 1948
(14) War, and to the Jihad operations of the Muslim Brothers in 1968 (15)
and thereafter.

<P>But even if the links have become distant from each other, and even
if the obstacles erected by those who revolve in the Zionist orbit, aiming
at obstructing the mad before the lihad fighters, have rendered the pursuance
of Jihad impossible; nevertheless, the Hamas has been looking forward to
implement Allah's promise whatever time it might take. The prophet, prayer
and peace be upon him, said:

<P>The time(16) will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill
them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry O Muslim!
there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him! This will not apply
to the Gharqad.(17) which is a Jewish tree (cited by Bukhari and Muslim)

<CENTER><B>The Strategy of Hamas: Palestine is an Islamic Waqf 19</B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Eleven</B>
<BR>The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine
has been an Islamic Waqf throughout the generations and until the Day of
Resurrection, no one can renounce it or part of it, or abandon it or part
of it. No Arab country not the aggregate of all Arab countries, and no
Arab King or President nor all of them in the aggregate, have that right,
nor has that right any organization or the aggregate of all organizations,
be they Palestinian or Arab, because Palestine is an Islamic Waqf throughout
all generations and to the Day or Resurrection. Who can presume to speak
for all Islamic generations to the Day of Resurrection this is the status
of the land in Islamic Shari' 20, and it is similar to all lands conquered
by Islam by force, and made thereby Waqf lands upon their conquest, for
all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. This (normal
has prevailed since the commanders of the Muslim armies completed the conquest
of Syria and Iraq, and they asked the Caliph of Muslims, 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab21.
for his view of the conquered land, whether it should be partitioned between
the troops or left in the possession of its population, or otherwise. Following
discussions and consultations between the Caliph of Islam, 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab,
and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, be peace and prayer upon
him, they decided that the land should remain in the hands of its owners
to benefit from it and from its wealth; but the control" of the land and
the land itself ought to be endowed as a Waqf in perpetuity for all generations
of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. The ownership of the land by
its owners is only one of usufruct, and this Waqf will endure as long as
Heaven and earth last. Any demarche in violation of this law of Islam,
with regard to Palestine, is baseless and reflects on its perpetrators.

<CENTER><B>Hamas in Palestine: Its Views on Homeland and Nationalism(24)</B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Twelve</B>
<BR>Hamas regards Nationalism (Wataniyya) as part and parcel of the religious
faith. Nothing is loftier or deeper in Nationalism than waging jihad against
the enemy and confronting him when he sets foot on the land of the Muslims.
And this becomes an individual duty's binding on every Muslim man and woman;
a woman must go out and fight the enemy even without her husband's authorization,
and a slave without his masters' permission.

<P>This [principle] does not exist under any other regime, and it is a
truth not to be questioned. While other nationalism consist of material,
human and territorial considerations, the nationality of Hamas also carries,
in addition to all those, the all important divine factors which lend to
it its spirit and life; so much so that it connects with the origin of
the spirit and the source of life and raises in the skies of the Homeland
the Banner of the Lord, thus inexorably connecting earth with Heaven.

<P>When Moses came and threw his batori, sorcery and sorcerers became futile.

<CENTER><B>Peaceful Solution; Peace Initiatives and International Conferences</B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Thirteen</B>
<BR>[Peace] initiatives, the so-called peaceful solutions, and the international
conferences to resolve the Palestinian problem, are all contrary to the
beliefs of the Islamic Resistance Movement. For renouncing any part of
Palestine means renouncing part of the religion; the nationalism of the
Islamic Resistance Movement is part of its faith, the movement educates
its members to adhere to its principles and to raise the banner of Allah
over their homeland as they fight their jihad: 'Allah is the all-powerful,
but most people are not aware."

<P>From time to time a clamouring is voiced, to hold an International Conference
in search for a solution to the problem. Some accept the idea, others respect
it, for one reason or another, demanding the implementation of this or
that conditions, as a prerequisite for agreeing to convene the Conference
or for participating in it. But the Islamic Resistance Movement, which
is aware of the [prospective] parties to this conference, and of their
past and present positions towards the problems of the Muslims, does not
believe that those conferences are capable of responding to demands, or
of restoring rights or doing justice to the oppressed. Those conferences
are no more than a meato appoint the non believers as arbitrators in the
lands of Islam. Since when did the Unbelievers do justice to the Believers?

<CENTER><B>The Three Circles</B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Fourteen</B>
<BR>The problem of the liberation of Palestine relates to three circles:
the Palestinian, the Arab and the Islamic. Each one of these circles has
a role to play in the struggle against Zionism and it has duties to fulfill.
It would be an enormous mistake and an abysmal act of ignorance to disregard
anyone of these circles. For Palestine is an Islamic land where the First
Qibla and the third holiest site are located. That is also the place whence
the Prophet, be Allah's prayer and peace upon him, ascended to Heavens

In consequence of this state of affairs, the liberation of that land is
an individual duty binding on all Muslims everywhere5. This is the base
on which all Muslims have to regard the problem; this has to be understood
by all Muslims. When the problem is dealt with on this basis, where the
full potential of the three circles is mobilized. then the current circumstances
will change and the day of liberation will come closer.

<BR>The Zionist invasion is a mischievous one. It does not hesitate to
take any road, or to pursue all despicable and repulsive means to fulfill
its desires. It relies to a great extent, for its meddling and spying activities,
on

<P>the clandestine organizations which it has established, such as the
Free Masons, Rotary clubs, Lions, and other spying associations. All those
secret organizations, some which are overt, act for the interests of Zionism

to wreck answerableness," to totter virtues and to wipe out Islam. it stands
behind the diffusion of drugs and toxics of all kinds in order to facilitate
its control and expansion.

<P>The Arab states surrounding Israel are required to open their borders
to the Jihad fighters, the sons of the Arab and Islamic peoples, to enable
them to play their role and to pin their efforts to those of their brothers
among the Muslim brothers in Palestine.

<P>The other Arab and Islamic states are required, at the very least to
facilitate the movement of the Jihad fighters from and to them. We cannot
fail to remind every Muslim that when the Jews occupied Holy Jerusalem
in 1967 and stood at the doorstep of the blessed Aqsa Mosque, they shouted

<CENTER><B>The Attempts to Isolate the Palestinian People</B></CENTER>


<P><B>Article Thirty Two</B>
<BR>World Zionism and Imperialist forces have been attempting, with smart
moves and considered planning, to push the Arab countries, one alter another,
out of the circle of conflict with Zionism, in order, ultimately, to isolate
the Palestinian People. Egypt has already been cast out of the conflict,
to a very great extent through the treacherous Camp David Accords, and
she has been trying to drag other countries into similar agreements in
order to push them out of the circle of conflict.

<P>Hamas is calling upon the Arab and Islamic peoples to act seriously
and tirelessly in order to frustrate that dreadful scheme and to make the
masses aware of the danger of coping out of the circle of struggle with
Zionism. Today it is Palestine and tomorrow it may be another country or
other countries. For Zionist scheming has no end, and after Palestine they
will covet expansion from the Nile to the Euphrates. Only when they have
completed digesting the area on which they will have laid their hand, they
will look forward to more expansion, etc. Their scheme has been laid out
in the protocols of the Elders of Zion, and their present [conductl is
the the best proof of what is said there.

<P>Leaving the circle of conflict with Israel is a major act of treason
and it will bring curse on its perpetrators.

O murabitun<A HREF="#2x">2</A> on the soil of immaculate and beloved Palestine:
O all our people, men and women. O our children: the Jews - brothers of
the apes, assassins of the prophets, bloodsuckers, warmongers - are murdering
you, depriving you of life after having plundered your homeland and your
homes. Only Islam can break the Jews and destroy their dream. Therefore,

is greater than their airplanes and their weapons. When you struggle with
them, take into account to request one of two bounties: martyrdom, or victory
over them and their defeat.<A HREF="#3x">3</A>

<P>In these days, when the problem is growing more acute and the uprising
is escalating, it is our duty to address a word to the Arab rulers, and
particularly to the rulers of Egypt, the Egyptian army, and the Egyptian
people, as follows: What has happened to you, O rulers of Egypt! Were you
asleep in the period of the treaty of shame and surrender, the Camp David
treaty! Has your national zealousness died and your pride run out while
the Jews daily perpetrate grave and base crimes against the people and
the children? And you, O army of Egypt, O descendants of Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi,<A HREF="#4x">4</A>
Qutuz <A HREF="#5x">5</A> and al-Zahir Baybars,<A HREF="#6x">6</A> what
has happened! Have the rulers paralyzed your movement and stripped you
of your power, making you so impotent that even the usurpers are no longer
frightened of you.<A HREF="#7x">7</A>

<P>And you, O defeated Egyptian people, which is incapable of doing anything,
God will help you and us. We greet you through the pioneer Muslims who
have come out of al-Azhar and all the universities in order to express
their solidarity with their brethren in Palestine, strengthen their hands,
and cry out to the usurpers that their end shall come in the morning--is
the morning far off-is it not near! [Know] that God does not abandon but
gives respite.

<P>Let the whole world hear that the Muslim Palestinian people rejects
the surrender solutions, rejects an international conference, for these
will not restore our people's rights in its homeland and on its soil. The
Palestinian people accuses all who seek this [solution] of weaving a plot
against its rights and its sacred national cause. Liberation will not be
completed without sacrifice, blood and jihad that continues until victory.

<P>Today, as the Muslim Palestinian people persists in rejecting the Jews
policy, a policy of deporting Palestinians from their homeland and leaving
behind their families and children--the people stresses to the Jews that
the struggle will continue and escalate, its methods and instruments will
be improved, until the Jews shall drink what they have given our unarmed
people to drink.

<P>The blood of our martyrs shall not be forgotten. Every drop of blood
shall become a Molotov cocktail, a time bomb, and a roadside charge that
will rip out the intestines of the Jews. [Only] then will their sense return.

<P>You who give the Jews lists containing the names of youngsters and spy
against their families, return to the fold, repent at once. Those who deal
in betrayal have only themselves to blame. All of you are exposed and known.

<P>To you our Muslim Palestinian people, Allah's blessing and protection!
May Allah strengthen you and give you victory. Continue with your rejection
and your struggle against the occupation methods, the dispossession, deportations,
prisons, tortures, travel restrictions, the dissemination of filth and
pornography, the corruption and bribery, the improper and humiliating behavior,
the heavy taxes, a life of suffering and of degradation to honor and to
the houses of worship.

<P>Forward our people in your resistance until the defeat of your enemy
and liquidation of the occupation. Then the mark of Cain shall be erased.
O our people of clean conscience! Spare no efforts [to fan] the fire of
the uprising until God gives the sign to be extricated from the distress.

Tuesday, Ramadan 17, a day of remembrance of the great Battle of Badr,<A HREF="#2xi">2</A>
a day of <I>jihad</I> and resistance.

<P>O Muslims, the month of Ramadan falls in the shadow of the oppression
and occupation and the escalation of the actions of the tyrannical Zionists:
restriction of worship, restriction of the Islamic giant, which had begun
to pour out of the mosques and turn this battle into a war of religion
and faith, in order to eradicate this cancer which is spreading through
the soil of <I>al-lsra -' wal-Mi 'raj</I> and is threatening the entire
Islamic world. Behold him murdering, wounding, and smashing hands and feet,
behold him strangling towns, villages, and camps by imposing curfew, behold
him suffocating the Muslims in the occupied land by closing markets and
destroying property. Behold them demolishing homes, expelling people from
Palestine, wave after wave. Behold them filling the prisons with thousands.
Behold them confiscating identity cards in order to force the inhabitants
to pay taxes, or seeking to make us perish through unemployment. Behold
them imposing heavy fines on vehicles, behold them permitting the herds
of settlers to attack everywhere without any consideration, behold them
cutting off power and water to camps and towns, uprooting fruit trees,
and confiscating amplifiers from mosques in order to prevent reading and
prayer and to silence the voice of "Allah is great." But they do all this
in vain, and their hope is dashed. For the uprising continues to escalate
despite the claims of the collaborators and the defeatists who try to disseminate
an atmosphere of despair and frustration among our people. To them we say:
the uprising goes on. Our people, inspirited, attacks repeatedly, like
waves of the sea without end. Our people, which has foiled all the programs
to settle the refugees and the American liquidation plans, is capable with
God's help of foiling all the Jews' attempts to eradicate the bluprising.

<P>O fasting <I>murabitun</I>,

<P>The month of Ramadan teaches us forbearance in tribulation and in encounters
with the enemy. Our capacity to endure is greater than what the enemy imagines.
We shall divide the loaf of bread amongst ourselves, we shall make all
the sacrifices, we shall remain steadfast on our path and we shall sidestep
the enemy's plots. We shall pay no heed to the economic strangulation,
the restrictions, and the barbaric measures.

<P>In the month of Ramadan the unity and cohesiveness of the Islamic nation
is manifested. Muslims must be alert to all the attempts of Israeli intelligence
to foment disputes and differences among the inhabitants by writing lying
slogans or distributing leaflets full of falsehoods.

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement emphasizes the need for unity, and announces
that it is not responsible for the leaflet signed in its name dated April
24, 1988. This is part of the attempts of [Israeli] intelligence to stir
up quarrels between the currents [among the Palestinians]. This policy
too is doomed to fail.

<P>O Muslims,

<P>After the night comes the dawn, after the hardships comes relief: Let
us be patient and help each other and thus stand firm, as did the Prophet
and his companions in the Battle of Badr. God brought them victory-despite
their [small] numbers and little equipment in the face of their enemies'
multitudes and vast strength--because they were God-fearing. This is the
key to victory.

<P>Let us make Tuesday, Ramadan 17, into a day ofjihad, a day of resistance
to the occupation, so that the occupiers will know that our people has
ousted them irrevocably. Our people will not give up its homeland and its
right to Palestine, no matter how long the road, and however precious the
sacrifices.

<P>Let our war slogan be:
<BR>In the name&middot; of Allah, Allah is great, in the name of Allah,
the hour of Khaybar has arrived.<A HREF="#3xi">3</A>

Muhammad and his forces defeated the people of Mecca. It was here that
the rules regarding spoils of war had their origin, as wellas the concept
that Muhammad's theocratic authority is unassailable. See Surah of the
Spoils of War (8).

<P>The martyr al-Qassam: No to the Balfour Declaration, yes to the blessed
uprising.

<P>Praise to God, Master of the believers, Vanquisher of the tyrants, peace
and prayer to our faithful prophet and to the righteous, unto the Day of
Judgment.

<P>Our Palestinian people, the series of barbaric Jewish actions is continuing
out of a desire to seize control of the stormy situation in our land of
Palestine. It is [our] duty to stress [these actions]: arrests, particularly
of clerics, preachers, sermonizers, university lecturers, [and the use
of torture against them, breaking into mosques to carry out searches; opening
fire in them and closing some of them, [with all this] being totally silenced;
insistently disrupting the educational process and studies by closing educational
institutions; a harsh economic assault on the farmers in general and on
olive-grove owners in particular by imposing heavy taxes on olive presses,
a move fraught with implications for the farmers; imposing curfew on all
villages in order to prevent the inhabitants from reaping the harvest;
prohibiting and restricting exports so that produce accumulates and prices
fall, with the result that [farmers] will not be able to cover the effort
[they invested] and their expenses; olive trees being damaged in assaults
tractors which carry out a death sentence against them and smash them to
pieces; earlier they undermined the grape harvest by barring exports, causing
frustration among farmers; persecuting merchants and confiscating their
vehicles and their identity cards in order to force to pay insane taxes.

<P>The Jews' behavior should come as no surprise, because history repeats
itself. It was in this very month that Banu Nadir plotted against our Prophet
may he 'est in peace They tried to roll a boulder on him when he was their
guest and after signing contracts with him.<A HREF="#2xii">2</A>&nbsp;
This is since they are the tribe of treachery and deceit. The "proof is
in the Qur'an: So learn a lesson. O ye who have eyes!"<A HREF="#3xii">3</A>

<P>Our patient people, frequently the <I>shirk</I><A HREF="#4xii">4</A>
and unbelief operate hand in hand against the faith. A [good] example is
the Balfour Declaration, that black page in contemporary history, when
Britain worked to realize the Zionist aspiration on the basis of the saying
they liked to repeat, "We are a people without a homeland who want a homeland
without a people," and thus Britain forsook all its pledges to Hussein

<P>Bin Ali, "he of the first bullet,"<A HREF="#5xii">5</A> the greatest
Arab traitor of our time. After the British forces conquered the port of
Gaza, Lord Arthur James Balfour published his statement (known as] "the
Balfour Declaration" on November 2, 1917, regarding the establishment Of
a national home in Palestine for what he termed "the Jewish people, and
promised that the British government would make efforts to accomplish this
goal. The Jews in Palestine were called a people even though they constituted
no more than 8 percent of the inhabitants of Palestine. Whereas the Arabs,
who were 92 percent, were called communities!!! Thus we are more convinced
[than ever) that the shirk and infidel states, whatever their names, are
faithful to the Zionist enemy, as it is written: "[O ye who believe! Take
not the Jews and the Christians for friends.] They are friends one to another.
He among you them for friends is [one] of them".<A HREF="#6xii">6</A>

<P>Our <I>murabit</I> people, on 19th Tishrin Thani INovember), 1935, the
<I>mujahid</I>, man of religion and Azhari teacher, Sheykh `Izz al-Din
al-Qassam, inscribed a new page of heroism when he fell martyr, together
with a group of his companions, after inflicting heavy losses on the British,
sacrificing his soul to Allah on the morning of that day in the groves
of Ya`bed near Jenin.

<P>This sheykh was a teacher in the Islamic school in Haifa and an imam
and preacher in al-Istiqlal mosque [in Haifa]...al-Qassam, symbol of self-sacrifice,
al-Qassam the spark of the [Arab] revolt of 1936!

<P>Our dear people, your movement, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
salutes you in your outposts for your resolute stand against the usurper,
and calls on you as follows:

<P>1. To preserve the unity of the people. Pay no heed to the enemy's attempts
to cause a rift in families, clans, currents of thought, and ideas.

<P>2. [We must] denounce the leaflets being planted in the name of Hamas,
which the occupier circulated in order to split the ranks and cast aspersions
on the [various] currents. We call on the entire people, including all
its factions, not to give the usurper an opportunity and to fight him.

<P>3. We must protect the educational institutions and ensure that they
fulfill their mission. We commend the role of the teachers and parents
who are tending to the education of our sons, in reaction to the occupier's
policy of suppressing education.

<P>4. Hold on to the land. Do not emigrate to satisfy momentary interests
such as studies, commerce, security, and flight from the iron fist. Do
not give the enemy s emigration policy a chance.

<P>5. Efforts [must] be made toward mutual aid during the olive harvest
in the West Bank, in order to foil the enemy's plan.

<P>6. We stress the strike on Saturday, October 29, the anniversary of
the Kafr Qassim massacre and the English-French-Israeli aggression against
Egypt, Arabism, and Islam.<A HREF="#7xii">7</A>

<P>7. Wednesday, November 2, marking the anniversary of the wretched Balfour
Declaration, will be a day of general strike.

<P>8. Wednesday, November 9, a day of general strike marking the start
of the twelfth month of the blessed uprising.

<P>9. A general strike on Saturday, November 19, marking the fall of the
man of religion and <I>mujahid</I>, Sheykh `lzz al-Din al-Qassam, and his
companions.

<P>Let the blessed uprising continue in the struggle against the occupiers.
Let us burn the ground under their feet with fire.
