<p><center><h2>Responding to Terrorism--the American Dilemma</h2></center>

<p><P>The recent bombings of U.S. embassies gave dramatic expression to the
central threat facing the U.S. for the past few years--world Islamic terrorism.
The U.S., in its role as the world leader in the fight against international
terrorism, must provide meaningful and globally applicative answers to
a number of factors pertaining to Islamic terror.

<P>Islamic terrorist organizations have been in the forefront of international
terrorism for the last few years. The most active organizations include
Gama’a el-Islamiya, the Egyptian al-Jihad, the Algerian GIA and the World
Islamic network under its various names, Ramzi Yousef (convicted in the
world trade center bombing), and more recently Osama bin Ladin and the
Afghan Veterans.

<P>According to the worldview of the Afghan Veterans, the western democracies--and
first and foremost the United States--are seen as their primary ideological
rival. For them this contest is a zero-sum game. Their violent activity
is directed against an existing world order in which Islam is in a position
of inferiority. They deny the legitimacy of the “secular” regimes ruling
Islamic countries. In an attempt to arrive at an alternative strategy,
the Afghan Veterans established new affiliations and connections with their
colleagues around the world. Bin Ladin--with his monetary fortune--was
able to bring them all together under his wing to forge a world Islamic
front. He basically fulfills the same function as a state sponsor to the
organizations under his auspices.

<P>Past experience has shown that state-sponsorship of terrorist organizations
is of central importance to their ability to influence international affairs.
In the past few years the United States and its allies have succeeded in
pulling the teeth of international terrorist organizations--with the exception
of those sponsored by Iran--through the expedient of separating them from
the states sponsoring them. This achievement is overshadowed however by
the active involvement of Osama bin Ladin in motivating the Afghan Veterans
to form a worldwide terrorist network. The American government has elected
to deal with the matter by means of a limited military operation meant
to meet existing needs on several levels:
<OL>
<LI>
On the bilateral level, with regard to the nations supporting the Afghan
Veterans--particularly Afghanistan and Sudan--there was a need to make
it clear that they cannot set themselves up as “nature reserves” for terrorists
without paying a heavy price.</LI>

<LI>
On the global level, a forceful gesture was needed toward the traditional
state sponsors of terrorism. This was aimed in particular at Iran, at Iraq
(should it return to terrorism as a means to fight the U.S.), and at Libya
(which is striving to escape the sanctions imposed on it according to Security
Council Resolution 478, and may be tempted to rehabilitate it’s terrorist
capabilities.)</LI>

<LI>
On the terrorists’ organizational level, there was a need to strike back
at the perpetrators of the attacks in east Africa, to make it clear that
they are not immune to retaliation. It was also necessary to stress the
disparity of forces on either side. The American strikes delivered a clear
message to other Islamic terrorists who may be contemplating attacks on
U.S. interests.</LI>

<LI>
On the national level of American public opinion, the American administration
was faced with a need to demonstrate to its citizens that their government
will take all necessary steps to protect them against extremists who continue
to threaten them with murderous attacks.</LI>
</OL>
&nbsp;

<P>It is as yet too early to evaluate how well the American operation met
the challenges that it was meant to answer.

<P>Afghanistan and Sudan, as expected, complained loudly about the violation
of their sovereignty, but have not so far increased their support for the
terrorist organizations. We can make a cautious estimate that both countries,
and in particular Afghanistan, will keep a closer watch on the doings of
bin Ladin et al within its territory. We can assume too that other state
sponsors of terrorism got the message with regard to their own activities.

<P>American public opinion, gladly taking to heart the message directed
at it, wholeheartedly supported the military action. The majority of Americans
saw the operation as both an appropriate and an encouraging response to
the perpetration and threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. citizens.

<P>With regard to the terrorists themselves, past experience has shown
that they will very likely step up their attempts in the near future to
attack the U.S. and its allies, in order to avenge their loss of face.
The U.S. must have the endurance to absorb possible retaliatory attacks.

<P>In order to estimate the level of the expected terrorist reaction, many
commentators have compared the present situation to that obtaining after
the American bombing of Libya in 1986. The attack on Libya is perceived
in the public eye as a successful example of the neutralization of a state
sponsoring and perpetrating active terrorism. We should point out, though
in spite of the differences in the two situations, that the primary moral
illustrated by Libya’s reaction to the American attack is not encouraging,
at least not in the short term. For roughly two years, between 1986 and
1988, Libya sponsored a wave of terror through the auspices of Abu Nidal,
by the Japanese Red Army and others. These groups carried out a series
of deadly attacks against the United States. The Libyan reactions reached
their peak with the downing by Libyan agents of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie in December 1988.

<P>It was only the international sanctions that went into force in 1992,
in the wake of the Lockerbie investigation, that caused Libya to alter
its behavior with regard to terrorism--to become a passive supporter of
terrorism rather than an active one.

<P>In summary, the success of the American operation will need to be judged
against its success in significantly decreasing the threat of Islamic terrorism
worldwide, even at the expense of a short term increase in attacks. Any
chance of success is dependent upon the Americans’ ability to muster international
cooperation against the state sponsors of terrorism on the assumption that
this will cause them to curtail their support to the terrorists. In order
for this to happen the U.S. needs to initiate a series of complementary
actions on the economic and political fronts. Such actions could take the
form of the arrest, extradition, or expulsion of terrorists and the imposition
of sanctions on countries that support or sponsor terrorism. Such actions
are likely to be more effective in lessening the threat of Islamic terrorism
than would military operations, whose value is primarily symbolic.
