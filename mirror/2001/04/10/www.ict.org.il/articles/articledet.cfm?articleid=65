<p><p><b>The need to define our terms</b>
<br>One of the quandaries facing academic researchers, military and security
professionals and politicians is the question of “defining terrorism.”
The prevailing opinion is that there is no international agreement on the
phenomenon of terrorism, nor can there ever be such agreement. Indeed,
the number of definitions in use today is at least as great as the number
of researchers. And yet, the strategic war against terrorism requires international
cooperation against terrorist organizations and the countries that sponsor
them. Such international cooperation requires us to reach an internationally
accepted definition of terrorism—based on objective and measurable criteria—on
which an international strategy for fighting terrorism can be established<font face="David">.</font>
<p>Such a definition should be based on the rules of warfare established
in the Geneva and Hague Conventions (and which most of the world’s countries
have signed). These conventions make a very important distinction. On the
one hand there is warfare that is seen as “legitimate,” in the course of
which military personnel intentionally attack enemy military personnel.
On the other hand there are “war crimes,” defined as any intentional attack
by military personnel on civilians. The emphasis in this distinction is
placed on the intention behind the actions—only the intentional targeting
of civilians is be defined as a war crime, and not merely a mistake made
in battle or an attack on civilians without prior intent.
<p>By the same token a distinction can be drawn between terrorism on the
one hand, and guerilla warfare on the other. Terrorism can be defined as
“the use (or threat to use) violence against civilians in order to achieve
political, ideological, religious and other objectives.” Guerrilla warfare
is “the use (or threat to use) violence against military and security personnel
in order to achieve political objectives.”
<p>At times the same political objectives are used to justify the use of
both terrorism and guerrilla warfare. In such cases, the two types of action
can be distinguished from each other only by their targets and modus operandi.
Thus, it can be determined that guerrilla warfare is a form of (legitimate)
warfare, while terrorism is a form of war crime. The definition of terrorism
as a war crime will enable states to act forcefully against terrorist organizations
and can provide a firm basis for international cooperation<font face="David">.</font>
<p>The states faced with terrorism and guerilla warfare have at their disposal
a wide range of defensive and offensive punitive measures against terrorist
organizations, as long as they do not violate the moral criteria of the
accepted rules of war, first and foremost the intentional harming of civilians.
True, these limitations make it difficult to conduct the war against terrorism—especially
as the terrorists are not themselves bound by them. However, without them
the state's moral basis to fight terrorism is<font face="David"> </font>null
and void.
<p><b>Hizballah: a case in point</b>
<br>The Israeli government's decision to change the rules of the game in
Lebanon, thus restoring the initiative to Israel in determining the “redline”
vis-a-vis Hizballah, was a step in the right direction. The agreements
signed by the previous government at the end of Operation Accountability
and Operation Grapes of Wrath determined “red lines” which sound, on the
face of it, reasonable and equitable, but which in reality serve Hizballah.
These “red-lines” were based on the principle of refraining from harming
civilians.
<p>Hizballah endorsed the principle set forth in the agreements, according
to which any harm to civilians by Israel—whether intentional or not—would
lead to retaliation against Israeli citizens in the North. Hizballah, operating
as it does from inside civilian towns, often in civilian guise, and enjoying
full civilian patronage, is fighting against military personnel in Lebanon.
Any attack, or even defensive action, against Hizballah is thus liable
to lead to unintentional casualties among civilians—an eventuality that
must send the residents of Northern Israel running for air raid shelters.
<p>It was clear to many—and certainly to the Israeli government—that there
was an urgent need to change the rules of the game and to determine a new
redline. This new line must rest on the requirement that the enemy pay
a high price for any attack on the northern communities. The usual response—Israel
Air Force retaliation against Hizballah targets—has so far been unsuccessful
in deterring the organization from firing missiles at Israel. The attempts
at large-scale ground operations in Lebanon also failed to yield the desired
results. What remains is to try and attack other targets, with the aim
of putting indirect pressure on Hizballah, and force the organization to
think twice before firing missiles at Israel. Israel’s aerial superiority
should indeed be exploited, however this air power must under no circumstances
be turned on civilian targets—even infrastructure-related targets such
as power plants, water facility, etc.
<p>Air power should be directed against Lebanese and Syrian military facilities
in Lebanon—against bases and command centers of the Lebanese Army, and
against Syrian dispositions in Lebanon—and not against civilian targets.
The pressure on Hizballah must come from the Lebanese and Syrian governments,
not from civilians. The intentional attacking of civilian infrastructure
(outside of an all-out war) will bring in its wake harsh international
criticism, pressure and sharp resolutions by the international community,
which ultimately will cause a rethinking of any decision to target civilian
infrastructure.
