in importance to military, diplomatic, information and economic power.
Each of these "instruments of power" is used as a tool to achieve national
security goals by various nations. As the environment gains in importance
worldwide, environmental warfare will take its place beside military warfare,
economic warfare, and information warfare.</TD>

<P><B>Environmental Warfare and its Implications</B>
<BR>Both policymakers and military planners of many nations are likely
to face the threat of environmental warfare in the near future. It has
many attributes that make it a preferred method of warfare. Generally,
it is cost-effective and requires no advanced weapons systems. If advanced
systems are available, they can be used to enhance weapons effectiveness
or increase options. Treaties are unlikely to hinder the operations of
many states. As a general rule, environmental attacks will be conducted
primarily by aerospace forces. Aircraft will be the preferred means to
attack dams, plants, and facilities. Aircraft will be used to disseminate
aerosols against crops and other resources. Space will become an environmental
battlefield.

<P>Despite these depressing conclusions, there is hope, as demonstrated
by the ACSC environmental warfare team. Military officers from four nations
with histories of conflict and environmental friction were able to gaze
soberly at the future. The team unreservingly identified the dangers before
the world. This cooperation by military professionals suggests that political
cooperation is also possible. Political action could eventually create
international conditions that would make the use of environmental warfare,
by anyone, unacceptable.

<P>It has been said that the reason that 1984 was not like 1984 was because
Orwell provided an appalling caution about how the future might be. ACSC's
environmental warfare research project results should be considered both
a warning to military planners and a plea to policymakers for action. The
cooperative effort shown by the team members indicates the stars are not
fixed. Environmental warfare need not become the scourge of the future.
International resolve and sincere desire to avoid the peril, however, are
indispensable.

<P>In the shape of its still-developing modes of destruction, the world
today threatens unprecedented risks and insecurities. More and more, it
looks very much like the anarchic world prophesied by the poet Yeats, a
world in which virtually everything exudes violence--the newspapers, "civilization,"
the very face of humankind. Terrorism, of course, is an important element
of this violence, and--in the future-- terrorism could even take a variety
of nuclear forms.

<P>Yet, despite a steadily expanding literature on counterterrorism, including
the threat of nuclear terrorism, little of real value has been produced
for the benefit of policymakers on the "front lines." To correct this very
portentous deficiency, scholars should soon begin to understand that effective
strategies for preventing nuclear terror must be extrapolated from more
generic strategies of counterterrorism. Moreover, the development of these
more general strategies is itself contingent upon a willingness and capacity
to ask the right questions.

<P>Before identifying these questions, it should be understood that insurgent
groups, in seeking to undertake acts of nuclear terror, would require access
to nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants or nuclear waste storage facilities.
Should such groups seek to manufacture their own nuclear weapons, they
would require both special nuclear materials and the expertise to convert
these materials into bombs or radiological weapons. <I>Both requirements
are now well within the range of certain terrorist organizations, especially
after the breakup of the Soviet Union</I>.

<P>The questions that need to be asked are mostly conceptual in nature
and can produce a fuller understanding of the risk calculations of terrorist
organizations. They focus, therefore, upon those factors that are most
likely to affect such calculations. Until we can understand the particular
terrorist stance on situational risk-taking<I>, and the vital differences
between terrorist groups on this stance</I>, we will not be able to identify
a promising policy for prevention and control.

<P>These questions need to be asked by all those who would now fashion
an effective strategy of counter nuclear terrorism for the United States.
Here it should also be noted that such a strategy would be entirely consistent
with the expectations of international law. From the standpoint of these
particular expectations, any use of nuclear explosives or radiation by
a terrorist group would represent a serious violation of the laws of war.
These laws have been brought to bear upon nonstate actors in world politics
by Article 3, common to the four Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949,
and by the two 1917 protocols to these conventions.

<P><I>Is there a particular ordering of preferences that is common to many
or to all terrorist groups, or is there significant variation from one
group to another?</I> If it can be determined that many or all terrorist
groups actually share a basic hierarchy of wants, a general strategy of
counter nuclear terrorist operations can begin to be shaped. Alternatively,
if significant variations in preference orderings can be detected between
terrorist groups, myriad strategies of an individually tailored nature
will have to be identified.

<P>Some of these strategies may include proactive measures, known in law
as expressions of <I>anticipatory self-defense</I>. Such measures would
be rooted jurisprudentially in the 1837 <I>Caroline</I> incident, which
concerned the unsuccessful rebellion in Upper Canada against British rule.
Here, then-Secretary of State Daniel Webster outlined a framework for self-defense
that did not require actual attack. Military preemption of a threat could
be judged permissible so long as the danger posed was "instant, overwhelming,
leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation."

<P><I>Are there particular preferences that tend to occupy the highest
positions in the preference hierarchies of terrorist groups, and how might
these preferences be effectively obstructed?</I> In this connection, it
is especially important to examine the widely held assumption that terrorists,
like states/countries, are most anxious to avoid negative physical sanctions.
In fact, a great deal of sophisticated conceptual analysis and experimental
evidence now indicates that such sanctions are apt to be especially ineffective
in certain circumstances and may even prove markedly counterproductive.

<P><I>To what extent, if any, would the obstruction of terrorist group
preferences prove offensive to some of our principal national values as
Americans?</I> In this case, we must be concerned about the very real possibility
that effective counter nuclear terrorist measures might be starkly injurious
to social justice and civil liberties. Here, the people and their government
must first decide whether the prospective benefits of proposed anti-terrorist
legislation/activity are great enough to outweigh the prospective costs.
This sort of decision is already current concerning controversy over The
Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995.

<P><I>To what extent, if any, are the risk calculations of terrorists affected
by geographic dispersion, and intermingling with other states, either friendly
or hostile to this country?</I> Because terrorist groups do not occupy
space/territory in the manner of states/countries, they are normally not
susceptible to usual threats of deterrence. How, then, might effective
counter nucleterrorism be reconciled withe reality of terrorist geographic
dispersion?

<P><I>To what extent, if any, might the decisional calculi of terrorist
groups be receptive to positive cues or sanctions as opposed to negative
ones, and, exactly, which rewards seem to warrant serious consideration?</I>
This, of course, is a most sensitive question, as we don't wish to violate
the longstanding peremptory principle of law known formally as <I>Nullum
crimen sine poena</I>, "No crime without a punishment." At the same time,
we need to weigh the value of this principle against that of saving lives,
perhaps even tens of thousands of lives. It will not be an easy equilibrium
to determine. (The generic imperative to punish crimes was reaffirmed at
Principle I of the Nuremberg Principles in 1946: "Any person who commits
an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible
therefore and liable to punishment." This obligation applies <I>especially</I>
to crimes of terrorism.)

<P><I>To what extent would the implementation of effective counter nuclear
terrorist measures require special patterns of international cooperation,
and how might such patterns be created? </I>In principle, the surest path
to success in averting nuclear terrorism against the United States lies
in a unified opposition to terrorism by all states. Yet, for the foreseeable
future, such opposition is assuredly not in the cards. We must, therefore,
ask ourselves, what cooperative patterns between particular states can
help to cope with the threat?

<P><I>To what extent, if any, are the risk calculations of terrorists affected
by their particular relations with "host" states?</I> Because terrorist
groups necessarily operate within the framework of states, the character
of the relationship between "visitor" and "host" will affect the viability
of counter nuclear terrorist measures. How, then, might our government
exploit what is known about such relationships in curbing the threat of
nuclear terrorism?

<P><I>To what extent, if any, are the risk calculations of terrorist groups
affected by alignments with states or with other terrorist groups?</I>
And how, therefore, can we use what we know about such effects to devise
a productive counter nuclear terrorist program? For the United States today,
this means special attention to prevailing alignments between radical Islamic
groups and various Arab/Islamic states, and between such groups directly.
Regarding interterrorist alignments in the Middle East, things are not
always what they seem. PLO and Hamas, for example, are not adversaries
in any meaningful sense (this notion is a fiction surrounding the so-called
Middle East Peace Process), but distinct allies in all matters of consequence.

<P><I>To what extent, if any, are the risk calculations of terrorist groups
affected by the terrorist pattern of random and uninhibited violence?</I>
In asking this question, we acknowledge, among other things, that terrorism
is a crime of both passion and of logic. Moreover, we may also acknowledge
here that orientations to death of particular terrorist organizations can
play a decisive role in their preferred forms of operation.

<P>Consider, for example, a recent statement by Jamal Abdel Hamid Yussef,
explaining operations of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, military wing
of Hamas, Gaza: "Our suicide operations are a message . . . that our people
love death. Our goal is to die for the sake of God, and if we live we want
to humiliate Jews and trample on their necks." Combined with access to
nuclear weapons, such an orientation to death warrants very close examination.

<P><I>To what extent, if any, are the risk calculations of terrorist groups
affected by the degree to which their policies evoke sympathy and support
from others?</I> As almost all acts of terror are essentially propagandistic,
it is important to understand their desired effects on selected publics
in order to prevent escalation to a nuclear option.

<P>Public authorities must also seek to prevent terrorist escalation to
other "higher-order" forms of violence using chemical and/or biological
weapons. Just as the prospect of nuclear terrorism is linked to the spread
of nuclear weapons and technology among states, so is the risk of chemical/biological
terrorism linked, inter alia, to the spread of CBW weapons and technology
among states. There already erdsts a regime of international treaties,
declarations and agreements designed to control chemical and biological
weapons.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>By considering these ten basic questions, scholars and policymakers
can create the critical foundations of a counter nuclear terrorist strategy
for the United States. As with all other adversarial groups, terrorists
acquire a repertoire of behavior under the particular contingencies of
reinforcement to which they are exposed. The task now is to understand
this repertoire and to use it in order to inform pertinent preventive action.

<P>In preparing for this task, both scholars and policymakers must understand
that terror has an impact beyond incidence. Terror always has a distinct
"quality," a potentially decisive combination of venue and destructiveness
that must be analyzed and anticipated. Linked to a particular species of
fear, this <I>quality of terror</I> must represent a crucial variable in
the war against terrorism.

<P>Let us consider, in this connection, the qualitative difference between
the actual Oklahoma City or World Trade Center bombings, and the potential
lethal irradiation of tens of thousands of Oklahomans or New Yorkers, either
by "small" nuclear explosions or by radiological contamination. Although
it is certainly conceivable that a terrorist resort to higher-order nuclear
destruction would prove to be counterproductive, this does not necessarily
suggest a corresponding terrorist reluctance to undertake such an escalation.
After all, if they are "logical" (rational), terrorists might not foresee
such counter-productiveness, and if they are "passionate" (irrational)
they might not care.

<P>Writing about that species of fear that arises from tragedy, Aristotle
emphasized that such fear "demands a person who suffers undeservedly" and
that it must be felt by "one of ourselves." This fear, or terror, has little
or nothing to do with our private concern for an impending misfortune to
others, but rather from our perceived resemblance to the victim. We feel
terror on our own behalf; we fear that <I>we</I> may become the objects
of commiseration.

<P>Terror, in short, is fear referred back to ourselves. Naturally, therefore,
the <I>quality</I> of this terror is at its highest point when this fear
is especially acute and where suffering acutely is especially likely. And
what could possibly create more acute fear of probable victimization than
the threat of nuclear terrorism?

<P>In seeking answers to our ten questions, scholars and policymakers will
need, again and again, to ask an antecedent conceptual question: What,
exactly, does the terrorist really hope to achieve? The answer? Above all,
perhaps, the terrorist wishes to transform pain into power. This transformation
is not always easy, as the correlation is not always proportionate. It
is possible, at least on occasion, that inflicting the most excruciating
and far reaching pain (the sort of pain that would be generated by nuclear
terrorism) will <I>inhibit</I> terrorist power, while causing less overwhelming
pain will <I>enhance</I> terrorist power.

<P>The terrorist who seeks to transform pain into power has already learned
from the torturer. He understands that pain, in order to be purposeful,
must point fixedly toward death, but that it must not always actually kill.
This is not to suggest, by any means, that terrorists do not seek to produce
as many corpses as possible, but only that leaving live witnesses--live
American witnesses, in our particular range of concern--is an essential
part of the drama.

<P>In the fashion of the torturer, the terrorist takes what is usually
private and incommunicable, the pain contained within the boundaries of
the sufferer's own body, and uses it to affect the behavior of others.
A grotesque form of theater that draws political power from the innermost
depths of privacy, terrorism manipulates and amplifies pain within tindividual
body for the express purpose of influenciothers who live outside that body.
Violating the inviolable, it declares with unspeakable cruelty not only
that no one is immune, but also that everyone's most private horror can
be made public.

<P>The terrorist and his victims experience pain and power as opposites.
As the victim's suffering grows, so does the power of the terrorist. And
as the power of the terrorist grows, so does the pain of his victims. For
the bystanders, and this includes all Americans who are not directly involved
in a particular terrorist attack, each infliction of pain is a mock execution,
a reminder of American vulnerability and a denial of absolute Government
power.

<P>A terrorist escalation in the "quality" of terror could follow directly
from a calculated correlation of pain and power. Terrorism intends to change
a prospective victim's general awareness that "All persons must die" to
the more specific awareness: "<I>I</I> must die--and maybe soon." Insofar
as a resort to vastly more destructive forms of terror could hasten this
change, the prospect of such resort should certainly be taken very seriously
in this country.

<P>The pain occasioned by terrorism, a pain that confers power upon the
terrorist, begins within the private body, and then spills out more widely
into the body politic. Wanting the two realms to become indistinguishable,
the terrorist generally understands that it is certainly not enough that
the victims feel pain. Rather, the pain must also be felt, vicariously
but palpably, by all those who might still become victims in the future.
When the pain has its origins in nuclear explosives or radioactivity, it
is apt to be "felt" with special intensity.

<P>There is one last point. In considering our ten essential questions,
both scholars and policymakers should recall that terrorist selection of
"quality" will be determined not only by calculating the expected effects
upon victim populations, but also because of these expected effects upon
the <I>perpetrators</I>. The "blooddimmed tide is loosed," says Yeats,
"and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned." From the start,
all terrorists have accepted the idea of violence as purposeful in part
because of its effect upon the perpetrator. Galvanized by what they have
long described as a "battle of vengeance" (a term used frequently by <I>Fatah</I>),
these terrorists have seen in their cowardly attacks not merely a way to
influence victim populations, but also the Fanonian logic of "purifying"
the victimizer.

<P>By the standards of contemporary international law, terrorists are known
as<I> host humani generis</I>, common enemies of human kind. In the fashion
of pirates, who were "to be hanged by the first persons into who hands
they fall" (from the distinguished 18th century legal scholar Emmerich
de Vatte), terrorists are international outlaws who fall within the scope
of "universal jurisdiction." On a tactical basis, however, the timely apprehension
of terrorists before they "go nuclear"--before the "ceremony of innocence
drowned"--is not an easy matter. To ensure that such apprehension can be
accomplished, scholars and policymakers should address themselves immediately
to the ten essential questions discussed above.
