Al-Asad</h2></center>

<P><p>The capture of three IDF soldiers from the Israeli-Lebanese border last
Saturday not only raises the danger of a third front for Israel—in addition
to the upheaval in the Palestinian territories and the tensions with Israel
Arabs inside sovereign Israel—but it offers the United States the first
opportunity to test the intentions and capabilities of Syria’s new yet
inexperienced president, Bashar al-Asad.
<p><b>The kidnapping as part of the asymmetric warfare</b>
<p>The fighting that has taken place over the course of the last two weeks
emphasizes the asymmetric nature of the interaction between Israel on the
one hand, and its Arab citizens, the Palestinians, and the Lebanese on
the other. Israel’s well-equipped regular army, augmented by police forces,
has confronted quasi-civilian forces with a limited arsenal consisting
of stones, Molotov cocktails, and light arms. But the media has proven
to be their most effective weapon. By using images of force, brutality,
and seeming imbalance, they have effectively galvanized the Arab world,
and rallied world public opinion behind them as the victim or “underdog.”
Side by side with the technological and the organizational asymmetry, an
asymmetry of values is reflected in the differing willingness of each side
to accept casualties in advancing its political goals.
<p>Hassan Nasrallah, Hizballah’s longtime leader in the fight against Israel,
has a profound understanding of the principles of asymmetric warfare, incorporating
them into the very foundation of his organization’s methods of operation.
On October 4th he said, addressing the Palestinians as his “brothers in
the struggle”: “The weak point of the Israelis is their love of life, but
we in Palestine and Lebanon have a strong point — we love martyrdom.”
<p>The common factor underlying each of the fronts which have emerged in
the last two weeks is the understanding that Israel cannot be beaten in
a conventional, symmetrical conflict, given its advanced military force,
but this force is less and less relevant in the recent asymmetric clashes.
It is this tactic that Hizballah and the Palestinians see advancing them
towards the goals they strive for.
<p><b>Military methods of action - a potential escalation</b>
<p>Israel is faced-not for the first time-with two possible modes of action
to solve the current situation: the operational-military channel, and the
diplomatic channel.
<p>The operational-military channel consists of both direct actions to
release the captured (such as Entebbe), and indirect ones. Direct actions
are deservedly rare, since such an action requires very specific conditions
and excellent intelligence, and still poses a very high risk factor. Assuming
that such conditions do not exist in the current situation—partly because
of Hizballah’s high level of awareness—Israel is left with indirect actions,
whose goal is exerting pressure on the captors. In the context of the current
situation, possibilities for military action include bombing and reciprocal
kidnapping directed against Hizballah or Syria, given that Israel perceives
Syria as responsible for any violation whatsoever of the understandings
along the northern border as the dominant power in Lebanon.
<p>Indirect actions such as these involve complicated cost-benefit considerations,
but such options cannot be dismissed out of hand: Israel may be forced
to take such a course of action. One possible consequence of military activity
in Lebanon is regional escalation and the regression of Lebanon into a
war-zone. Such a scenario would have many losers, both among the direct
participants (Israel, Lebanon, Hizballah, and Syria) and among the countries
indirectly involved in the region, including Europe and the United States.
<p><b>Diplomatic methods of action</b>
<p>At the moment, it seems that the kidnapping serves the interests of
Hizballah well. They are perceived both as a proud militant organization,
mindful of its men in the Israeli prison, and as a symbol and a spearhead
of the Arab struggle.
<p>This leads to the conclusion that in order to make Hizballah forfeit
its advantage or capitulate, there is a need to influence other players,
such as Syria and Iran. The latter, although it has considerable influence
over Hizballah, seems content with the current situation since it fuels
the Islamic Revolution. Therefore, little would be gained from exerting
diplomatic pressure on Tehran to release the IDF soldiers.
<p>These conclusions leave Syria as the only player in the region that
may repay any efforts spent in the current crisis, both now and in the
future.
<p><b>A test for Bashar and an opportunity for U.S. policy</b>
<p>This crisis constitutes a test of Bashar al-Asad’s intentions. He may
decide to support Hizballah, or at least maintain neutrality. For him,
a measured escalation on the Israel-Lebanese border may be a welcome reminder
to Israel that peace will not reign on its northern border until it returns
the Golan Heights in their entirety to Syria. In addition, a certain degree
of Lebanese instability and Israeli involvement could reduce or marginalize
the voices recently raised in Lebanon against the Syrian presence. If these
are his intentions, then the situation on Israel’s northern front will
deteriorate, forcing Israel to engage in military action against Hizballah
and perhaps Syrian assets, even inside Syria proper. This crisis should,
therefore, be viewed not only as a humanitarian dilemma but also a strategic
one because if the situation deteriorates, it could escalate into a full-scale
war.
<p>On the other hand, Bashar al-Asad may be prepared to play a moderating
role. After all, the kidnapping and its reverberations in the media strengthen
Hizballah’s power as a central actor in the Lebanese arena-a threat to
Syrian hegemony. Bashar may be perceived as being led by events rather
than leading them unless he takes charge of this crisis. By assuming a
commanding role, Bashar can emphasize his hegemony over Lebanon, and tighten
his grip over Syria as well.
<p>Furthermore, Bashar seems to regard the advancement of his economy as
his main interest and the primary guarantor of his regime’s survival. Playing
not just a central but a positive role in this crisis may allow him to
shortcut some of the problems he faces in gaining fuller access to the
world economy. Herein lies an opportunity for the United States. By offering
to work with Bashar on opening up Syria’s economy, it may be able to persuade
him to choose the path of moderation-if Bashar cooperates, then much could
be possible down the road including the removal of Syria from the list
of states sponsoring terrorism, U.S. monetary assistance and, perhaps,
encouragement for U.S. investment in Syria and Lebanon.
<p>Given Bashar’s inexperience and the general uncertainty among observers
about his intentions, it will be important to provide him with reasons
to play the moderating role. He should therefore be persuaded through active
diplomacy, with participation from the United Nations and countries such
as Russia and Britain as well as the United States. An effort should also
be made to dissipate objections that might be voiced in the Arab world
in the event he chooses moderation.
<p>If Bashar helps resolve this crisis, he will be seen as the “good guy”
in the eyes of the world and the Israeli public. That would help him reach
the negotiating table in a stronger position, whenever Syrian-Israeli peace
talks resume. Everything considered, this crisis provides Bashar with an
opportunity to cut Hizballah down to size, to advance his economic goals,
to secure diplomatic support, and to strengthen his bargaining position
in the Syrian-Israeli peace process.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>There is no doubt that the Palestinian-Israeli front is where most diplomatic
effort should be targeted. But decision-makers would do well to use this
kidnapping as a test of Bashar al-Asad, who is not likely to have a better
opportunity soon to prove his bona fides to the United States. Nor is the
States likely to have a better opportunity to test whether Bashar could
be moved out from his father’s shadow and toward a more moderate position,
thereby advancing U.S. interests in a more stable and peaceful Middle East.
