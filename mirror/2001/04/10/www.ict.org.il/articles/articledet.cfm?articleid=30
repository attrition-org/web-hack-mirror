<TD><B>On the first of April, 98 the Ministerial Committee for National
Security voted unanimously to accept UN Security Council Resolution 425</B>
calling for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon under appropriate security
arrangements. Israel called upon the Lebanese government to open negotiations
for the return of its effective control over southern Lebanon and the "security
zone", and the prevention of terrorist activity directed at Israel from
southern Lebanon. It was emphasized that Israel views the continued safety
of the residents of the "security zone" and of the SLA personnel as an
integral part of Resolution 425, and of any agreement for secure borders
between Israel and Lebanon. Article 5 of the Israeli decision stipulates
that Israel will continue its quest for peaceful agreements with all its
neighbors.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>2.</B></TD>

<TD><B>The Cabinet Decision is significant for several reasons:</B>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
This is the first decision of its kind since the one in 1985, in which
Israel declared for the first time its readiness to withdraw the IDF from
Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425, subject to arrangements that
Israel views as implicit in, or derived from, the resolution.&nbsp;</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The decision rests on the recognized international foundation of Security
Council resolution 425, which includes all the ingredients necessary for
the restoring of Lebanese sovereignty over South Lebanon, the agreed upon
withdrawal of the IDF, and its replacement by the effective control Lebanese
Army.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The decision emphasizes that the IDF will not withdraw unilaterally, but
only subject to security arrangements, which will guarantee the cessation
of terrorist activity, and the safety and security of the SLA and the residents
of the "security zone".</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The cabinet decision does not specify what security arrangements are required
by Israel. However, resolutions 425 and 426 call for the effective deployment
of the Lebanese army, the dismantling of the military infrastructure of
terrorist organizations, and the prevention of terrorist activity against
Israel from Lebanese territory.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
The cabinet decision mentions Israel's determination to seek security arrangements
in southern Lebanon, and emphasizes that such arrangements do not negate
the continuation of the ovrerall peace process (from Israel's point of
view, the security arrangements with Lebanon settlement may even further
the overall settlement).</LI>
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>3.</B></TD>

<TD><B>What the Decision doesn't say</B>
<UL>
<LI>
The decision does not include political/strategic conditions and is not
a substitute for a full peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon. In addition
it does not make the IDF withdrawal conditional upon withdrawal of Syrian
troops from Lebanon, mentioned in Security Council resolution 520. All
things considered, the conditions for an IDF withdrawal are indeed the
bare essentials, and so have more potential to be met.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Although the decision does call upon the Lebanese government to open negotiations
with Israel, no mechanism is stipulated for the ironing out of the various
arrangements necessary for an IDF withdrawal. The matter is left open to
further diplomatic discussion between Israel and the different parties
involved.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The length of time necessary for the negotiation is left open, in recognition
that the complexity and political sensitivity of the issues involved are
not such as to admit of an overnight solution. Seen in this light Israel's
decision to accept resolution 425 is not immediately practicable, since
its implementation does not depend on Israel alone. Rather the decision
forms the basis for creative diplomatic activity aimed at creating the
conditions under which it may be implemented.</LI>
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>4.</B></TD>

<TD><B>To summarize</B>&nbsp;
<UL>The cabinet decision thus signals Israel's desire to alter the dangerous
situation prevailing in southern Lebanon for over 20 years, by implementation
of UN Security Council resolution 425. In the past any such change was
precluded by the lack of a stable government and effective military in
Lebanon. However, in our estimation, conditions in Lebanon are now ripe
for change. The realization of this potential and the implementation of
the cabinet decision will require time, patience, and some creative diplomacy
to find ways around the current obstructionism of Syria and Lebanon.</UL>
