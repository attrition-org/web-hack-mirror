<p><img SRC="../graphics/aum_w.gif" height=174 width=200 align=RIGHT>In
January 1995, two months before the poison gas attack in the Tokyo subway,
a blatantly anti-Semitic tract, under the title “Manual of Fear: The Jewish
Ambition – Total World Conquest,” was published in the journal
<i>Vajrayana
Sacca </i>of the apocalyptic religious cult Aum Shinrikyo (Supreme Truth).
This tract was described as the culmination of a decade of anti-Semitic
propaganda in Japan.[1] Aum Shinrikyo is not only a cult with a skillful
propaganda apparatus, it is also the only organization in the world that
has perpetrated deadly chemical and biological terrorist attacks, notably
the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway on 20 March 1995. Thus, we might
ask if this cult represents a threat to the Japanese people, to the world
and, in light of its extreme anti-Semitism, to the Jews. In order to understand
Aum’s anti-Semitism, one must analyze its religious-political ideology
and identify those the cult leader sees as its strategic enemies.
<p>Aum Shinrikyo began operating as a religious organization in July 1987,
having been founded as the Aum Shinsen no Kai organization in 1984.The
head of the cult was Chizuo Matsumoto, also known as Shoko Asahara, a partially
blind, charismatic former acupuncturist and yoga instructor, self-styled
as the “one and only person who has acquired supreme truth” and who attributed
to himself supernatural powers.[2]
<p>By the time of the Tokyo attack in March 1995, the cult had grown into
a large organization of some 10,000 Japanese members, with branches in
Russia, Germany, the United States and Sri Lanka. Its wealth came from
the savings that new members turned over to the cult, from tax-exempt businesses
staffed by cult members, and from fraud and extortion. Aum's assets have
been estimated at between 300 million and one billion dollars. The cult
succeeded in recruiting highly trained scientists and graduate students
in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and electrical engineering. Its
recruiting methods include a wide range of standard brainwashing techniques,
such as sleep deprivation and forced isolation.[3]
<p>In August 1989, the cult formed its own political organization, the
Shinri Party, which contested the 1990 general election. None of the 25
candidates won seats. The election failure gave rise to a feeling of frustration
among members, producing a change in tactics, which included harassment
of those outside the cult. Furthermore, it established a quasi-governmental
system with its own structures mirroring those of Japan's state administrative
machinery. The doctrinal basis for this organizational policy was “the
plan to save mankind facing the ultimate chaos of Armageddon.” This hierarchy
of “ministries and agencies” was widely seen as being in direct opposition
to the Japanese nation.
<p>At the same time, the cult arranged for the mass-production of a thousand
Russian K-74 rifles. It also purchased a helicopter (for air delivery of
chemical weapons) and made repeated attempts to enter the plant facilities
of major private sector enterprises with a view to spying and stealing
advanced military technology. It had equipment capable of cultivating bacterial
weapons on a large scale and for biochemical testing. The cult also had
plans to cultivate the extremely neurotoxic clostridium botulinum for dispersion,
using vaporizers .
<p>Aum Shinrikyo plotted to produce and use 70 tons of sarin. For this
purpose, a large-scale chemical plant was built and the chemicals required
for the synthesis of sarin were purchased. The cult's involvement with
chemical warfare also included an assassination attempt with the nerve
gas VX (a substance far more lethal than sarin), released in the car of
a religious enemy of the cult, and the experimental pilot-plant production
of poison gases such as tabun and soman.
<p>On a number of occasions in the early 1990s, Asahara ordered the use
of these weapons to strike at enemies and to try to create disasters that
would confirm his prophesies. In April 1990 Aum attacked the Japanese parliament
with botulinum toxin aerosol, and in June 1993 it targeted the wedding
of the crown prince. Later that month, Aum reportedly also attempted to
spray anthrax spores from the roof of a building in Tokyo. There were no
casualties as a result of these attacks.[4]
<p>For several years, Aum's activities went unpunished, despite substantial
press attention and some official investigations. It should be noted that
in 1989 Aum had officially been recognized as a religious organization,
giving it a significant degree of protection from official interference.
It was only in early 1995 that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police began to investigate
Aum Shinrikyo seriously.
<p>In response, on 15 March, Aum reportedly made an abortive aerosol botulinum
toxin attack in the Tokyo subway. Finally, a small batch of low-grade sarin
was made and used in the 20 March subway attack, which left 12 people dead
and more than five thousand injured. Planned and executed clumsily and
at short notice, this attack was less successful than originally feared,
saving thousands of people from death.
<p>After the attack, police raided the cult's facilities nationwide and
dismantled the organization. Hundreds of members of the cult were arrested,
but Asahara himself was arrested only on 16 May. In the intervening weeks,
the cult had carried out further attacks, including the shooting of the
Tokyo police commissioner (who survived), and an abortive attack with an
improvised cyanide gas generator at a Tokyo train station.
<p>In April 1996 the first hearings in the trial of Shoko Asahara were
held at a Tokyo district court. He faces murder and other charges relating
to 17 alleged crimes, including the release of the poison gas sarin in
Tokyo’s subway, but the trial could last many more years. Some leading
members of the cult involved in the killings and terrorist attacks have
been sentenced, one of them to death.
<p><b>Aum’s Religious Tenets and Ideology</b>
<p>From 1984 until 1986 the group under Asahara developed around yoga lessons
and “miracle” experiences. In 1987, however, it began to assume an ardently
religious character, its doctrine based on early Buddhism.
<p>In his study of Aum, the Japanese specialist in New Religions Shimazono
Susumu stresses that while the cult is specifically a problem of Japanese
culture, its beliefs bear a relationship to contemporary religio-cultural
trends throughout the world.[5] It should be noted that Asahara claimed
to be Jesus, which allowed him to add to Aum's Buddhist doctrines the Judeo-Christian
concept of the Last Judgment and the final battle of Armageddon. The scheduling
of Armageddon enabled the guru to append a fashionable millennial urgency
to Buddhism's timeless world view.
<p>Asahara and his followers, certain that the apocalypse was coming, thought
at first to ensure survival through religion, but shifted gradually, during
the years 1988-89, from preparing for the survival of people outside the
group to the survival only of the “chosen,” and finally, in 1994, to “survival
through combat.” In order to survive Armageddon they had to become “superhuman.”
Thus the group attempted to prove that those engaged in spiritual practice
possessed a special resistance to chemical and bacterial agents, should
they be attacked by ABC (atomic, biological, chemical) weapons.
<p>Aum introduced new elements into the history of Japanese religions:
the demand for complete obedience to the leader, together with implanting
this subservience through severe ascetic practice, and the physical infusion
of the leader’s power, energy and knowledge into the believer so that he
becomes one with the leader, physically and mentally. The form of guru
worship that emerged from these beliefs resembles religious cults on the
rise in advanced countries throughout the world. However, worship of the
leader does not become truly dangerous uthe s/he possesses unrestricted
power,[6]<sup> </sup>as in the case of Aum.
<p><b>Enemies and Strategy</b>
<p>In 1992, Asahara claimed that a vast shadowy power, variously identified
as Japan, the United States, and a conspiracy of Jews, Freemasons, the
British royal family (which, allegedly, has remote Masonic ties) and rival
Japanese religions, would launch a third world war. (Japan has 2,512 Freemasons,
almost all of them foreigners, and fewer than one thousand Jews).
<p>Asahara thought it likely that Japan would be attacked by the United
States, identified with the Beast in the Book of Revelations, because economic
motives pitted the United States against Japan. In its rhetoric, it accused
the US and the West of spreading rampant materialism and internationalism,
which the cult saw as the root of Japan’s problems.
<p>In early I994 Asahara accused the United States of masterminding and
carrying out a series of chemical attacks on himself and on Aum facilities
in Japan. That year the cult produced a video which claimed to document
American poison gas attacks. An Aum spokesman reassured his audience that
the sect was not the producer of sarin gas, but its victim. He charged
that in the past few years some two hundred and forty Japanese and American
aircraft had swooped low over Aum's compound spraying the deadly gas.[7]
<p>The cult's monthly publication, <i>Vajrayana Sacca</i>, contained an
article hinting at planned terrorist assassinations of various Japanese
officials. A number of prominent Japanese officials are listed as “black-hearted
aristocrats who have sold their souls to the devil.” Included is the honorary
president of Soka Gakkai International (Aum had previously made an unsuccessful
attempt on his life when it tried to use sarin for the first time), a major
Japanese religious group that Asahara despised and regarded as his chief
religious rival in Japan; the governor of Tokyo; and the head of the New
Frontier Party.[8]&nbsp;<sup> </sup>Asahara believed that in order to save
Japan as a whole, he had no choice but to destroy the present government
and to set up an Aum dictatorship. Then he had to prepare his chemical
and biological arsenal, seeking to bring about Armageddon as the means
of his victory.
<p>If America was Aum's first target, the world Jewish community was its
second. In the tract “Manual of Fear: The Jewish Ambition -- Total World
Conquest,” Aum claimed that the Jews had taken advantage of Japan's devastation
after World War II as a step in their conspiracy to achieve total world
domination. Aum saw the United States as controlled by Jewish capital,
which directed the Freemasons, while the Freemasons allegedly used the
UN to achieve universal control. The “Manual of Fear” is actually a “declaration
of war” on the Jews. “On behalf of the earth's 5.5 billion people,” the
editors wrote, “<i>Vajrayana Sacca</i> hereby formally declares war on
the ‘world shadow government’ that murders untold numbers of people and,
while hiding behind sonorous phrases and high-sounding principles, plans
to brainwash and control the rest. Japanese, awaken! The enemy's plot has
long since torn our lives into shreds.”[9]
<p>Jews are accused of everything from the massacres in Bosnia to those
in Rwanda and Cambodia. Linking the Jews to its enemies in Japanese society,
the “black aristocracy” and the “internationalists,” Aum even published
a list of these enemies, including cosmopolitan Japanese, labeled Jewish
Japanese.[10]
<p><b>The Background of Aum Shinrikyo’s Anti-Semitism</b>
<p>A recent study on current Japanese attitudes toward Jews notes that
Japan is a special case in modern anti-Semitism since there are few Jews
in Japan, and the Japanese do not distinguish between Jews and other non-Japanese.
Anti-Semitism is not rooted in Japan, beginning only in the twentieth century
and it lacks any religious context of conflict. Judaism has never threatened
or clashed with any of the religions practiced in Japan, but this has not
prevented several waves of anti-Semitism in this century.[11]
<p>Anti-Semitism in Japan, which may be defined as the belief in a global
Jewish conspiracy bent on destroying Japan, has four sources: indigenous
xenophobia; the image of the Jew derived from Western literature; certain
Christian theologies; and the conspiracy theory of <i>The Protocols of
the Elders of Zion</i>. <i>The Protocols</i> seemed particularly plausible
to the Japanese because they bore a close resemblance to the domestic theory
of an occult religion threatening Japan that had appeared a hundred years
before.[12]
<p>In the mid-1980s there was a recrudescence of anti-Semitism in Japan,
when dozens of anti-Semitic books were sold in millions of copies. Part
of the responsibility for this resurgence lay with the Japanese left, whose
anti-Zionist rhetoric tended to de-humanize the Jews and de-legitimize
Jewish culture. A few extreme left-wing ideologues even propagated theories
of an international Jewish conspiracy that were indistinguishable from
those of their rightist counterparts.[13]
<p>One of the most popular and prolific anti-Semitic authors, the fundamentalist
Christian minister Uno Masami, published two books in 1986, claiming that
the United States was a “Jewish nation” ruled by a clandestine Jewish “shadow
government.” In 1992, a new anti-Semitic author, Ota Ryu, traced the Jewish
plot to destroy Japan back 1,200 years to the Nara period of Japanese history.
In early 1995, two books appeared that even blamed the Jews for the Kobe
earthquake in January 1995.
<p>Thus, Aum’s anti-Semitism developed in a favorable cultural climate
and expressed ideas and trends already present in Japanese society, albeit
on its extreme fringes. The publication of vitriolic material such as Aum’s
was possible because the Japanese government had never considered the circulation
of anti-Semitic materials as harmful. Their unrestricted availability is
accepted by Japanese at all levels because the right of freedom of expression
in post-war Japan is absolute.[14]
<p><b>Current Developments</b>
<p>Although stripped of its legal status and tax privileges as a religious
organization, following the poison gas attack in Tokyo, Aum Shinrikyo revived
its activities in early 1997. The government, concluding it was no longer
a threat, stopped short of using the anti-subversion law to ban it. However,
according to the Japanese Public Security Investigation Agency, the cult
should remain under close surveillance.
<p>The number of Aum followers is leveling off, not decreasing. Currently,
Aum has nearly 2,000 followers, including more than 500 live-in members.
The latter live in 15 cult bases across Japan. The cult owns 28 compounds
in 18 Japanese prefectures for religious training, missionary work and
other operations. Out of some 400 Aum disciples arrested in crackdowns
on the cult since 1995, a total of 155 have returned after being released.[15]
<p>For ex-followers there are tips on using false names and diversionary
tactics to re-join. Sometimes Aum sells itself as a yoga group or sponsors
animation film festivals. Its house band, Perfect Emancipation, performs
regularly and its pamphlets appear periodically. Millions of recruitment
leaflets, with Asahara's face on the back cover, are again being distributed
at train stations, on college campuses and in mail boxes.[16]
<p>Aum has significantly increased its fund-raising activities. Thirteen
Aum-associated businesses and five stores earn billions of yen each year.
The cult's specialty, as before, is selling cheap computers. In 1997 its
computer sales earned it more than 57.5 million dollars. The cult also
continues to collect large sums from followers. The police reported that
in the final four months of 1998, it earned more than 200,000 dollars from
310 seminars attended by 7,000 people. The Golden Week Intensive Seminar
in the spring of 1999 at a campsite near Tokyo drew about 200 followers,
who paid 100,000_200,000 yen to join, with some paying half a million yen
more for “initiation” rituals, a total of some 500,000 dollars, said investigators.[17]
Thus, once again Aum has the financial resources to advance its religious,
ideological and political objectives.[18]
<p>With Asahara on trial, the cuis headed by Reika Matsumoto, his teenage
daughter, followed in command by Chorobu, a group of senior cultists. One
of Asahara's closest and most charismatic disciples, Fumihiro Joyu, who
served as the cult's spokesman before his arrest, was freed in November
1998 after serving time for forgery and other minor charges. His return
could be a boost to Aum.
<p>Aum now has its own sites on the Internet, available in Japanese, Russian,
English and lately also in German.[19] Users can read the latest news on
the court trials, hymns and reminiscences of the Master’s’ uncanny brilliance
or check up on missions to Russia and elsewhere. The sites have a radio
station and are preparing to put a TV station on air. “Evangelion tes Basileias”
is the name of the radio program of Russian Aum Shinrikyo.
<p>Aum's website makes no mention of the cult's crimes. The death doctrine
has reappeared on the website and in leaflets -- despite Asahara's vow
to prohibit its dissemination. His doomsday preachings are also reappearing
in the cult's magazines and on its website, where a follower recently wrote:
“Devotion to the guru is all that counts.”
<p><b>Anti-Semitism – A Central Theme in Aum’s Ideology</b>
<p>Aum’s new website is composed of ten chapters, one of which (the seventh)
is devoted to Freemasonry, in fact, anti-Semitism. The site in English
includes the full text of <i>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>; interestingly,
the site in Russian contains, in addition to <i>The Protocols</i>, fifty-eight
extremely anti-Semitic articles, which do not appear at all in English.[20]
<p>In light of Aum’s past anti-Semitic propaganda and its lethal terrorist
attacks, It is important to analyze the content of this material. The chapter
on “Freemasonry” contains three parts: an interview with Aum’s leader Asahara;
a page which tries to prove, in a rather puerile manner, that Asahara was
“prophesized”; and the “Freemasons' conspiracy,” which is, in fact, <i>The
Protocols</i>.[21]
<p>In the introduction to this chapter, Aum presents the modern world as
divided between “administrative materialism,” that is, communism, which
preaches “material equality,” and “free materialism,” that is, liberalism,
whose principal is “Let those earn who want to earn.” But, in fact, according
to Aum’s ideology, the only difference between East and West, left and
right, is whether the materialism is free or administrative.[22]
<p>Given this situation, there are “they” who have the power to influence
the modern world.[23]&nbsp; “They” control the media and thus “they” can
control the world and the events in it. Even the disintegration of the
Soviet Union was the result of the manipulation of these mysterious people,
in order to end its role as an adversary of the West.
<p>In the texts, “they” are presented as “X,” and never as the Jews. But
to be sure that there is no mistake about their identity, Master Asahara
stresses the importance of the Ten Commandments in their religious doctrine.
According to him, “The Ten Commandments are exclusively for X ... and they
are only thinking how X can be wealthy and happy [<i>sic</i>].”
<p>On the website the Master declares:
<dir>I think those world’s manipulators are in considerably high spiritual
stages ... Their spirituality might be equivalent to that of Aum’s Taishis,
or even slightly above … Perhaps, close to Maha-Mudra.[24] People on that
level manipulate the world, slowly over a long period of time. They never
do this in haste, but over several hundred years, or more precisely, over
seven or eight hundred years. I would admire them if only their intrigue
were harmless.</dir>
Jews also control world finance and banking.
<dir>They control the balance of supply and demand to raise prices. Because
money transactions are simplified by credit cards, banks collect money
... Banks make profit simply by being entrusted with money ... Through
money controls like this, they are gathering money. They don’t have to
work. If they are entrusted with one trillion dollar a year, for example,
their profit is automatically its 20%, twenty billion dollars. They are
playing games with their intelligence. I think those manipulators are rather
intelligent.</dir>
In a discussion on the Devil and his materialistic nature, Asahara claimed
that currently the earth was polluted by “perfect materialism” and was
under the Devil’s control. According to him this diffusion of materialism,
was facilitated during the Renaissance by the Black Death (the plague).
“It was because of the Black Death that X gained power. Or I should say,
I consider that the Black Death was plotted by X … Before that time, wealth
was more equally distributed. And suddenly, the disparity between the rich
and the poor was enlarged.”
<p>Aum has a special function in this materialistic and corrupt world:
<dir>This Gross World undergoes a destructive transition. In other words,
the Realm of Human Beings will be incorporated into the Realm of Animal.
Therefore, to sustain the present form of the universe, this transition
needs to be counteracted by its homeostasis, the self-restoring function
of the universe. I regard the existence of Aum as one of the typical appearances
of the universal self-restoring function.</dir>
Moreover, in Asahara’s eyes, Aum must be a menace to the manipulators,
because “it is a firmly united group ... and because it takes no notice
of the modern value system they [the manipulators] are trying to teach.
They cannot control us. We don’t bite the food they feed us [<i>sic</i>].”
Hence, Aum regards itself as the enemy of those negative, mysterious forces,
the unnamed X, the Jews.
<p>Even in prison Asahara is continuing to update his teachings in connection
with the Jews and Israel and transmits them to his worshippers. In discussing
the meaning of Armageddon, he answered a question of his lawyer in court:
“If I remember correctly, it was in the first week of November in 1995,
when the late Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated. Leaders of
the world gathered in Israel. I regard this as the end of a prophesied
event, kings assembling at Armageddon.”
<p>These citations make it clear that Aum’s anti-Semitism is influenced
by and accords with writings and ideas prevailing in contemporary Japanese
anti-Semitic circles and literature, including radical right-wing motifs.
Interestingly, the Holocaust and Holocaust denial, themes of Western right-wing
radicals and their Japanese counterparts, do not appear in Aum’s ideology.
<p><i>The Protocols</i> (which were introduced by soldiers returning from
the Siberian intervention of 1918_23), had a powerful impact in Japan,
introducing a new dimension into indigenous Japanese conspiracy theories.[25]&nbsp;
With a central role in Aum’s ideology, propaganda and indoctrination, they
enable Master Asahara to explain many difficult events and phenomena and
convince his followers to unite their ranks and organize for the final,
decisive battle against the Devil and its representatives in Japan.
<p>Not surprisingly, the gas attack in the Tokyo subway, which Asahara
chose as the operational method for fighting its enemies (the Japanese
government, the United States, the West in general and the Jews) is “prophesized”
in the ninth chapter of <i>The</i> <i>Protocols</i>:
<dir>You may say the goyim will rise upon us, arms in hand if they guess
what is going on before the time comes; but in the West we have against
this a maneuver of such appalling terror that the very stoutest hearts
quail - the undergrounds, metropolitans, those subterranean corridors which,
before the time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence
those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organizations
and archives.[26]</dir>
The motifs of the Jews being responsible for the plague in the Middle Ages
and their historical role in the development of capitalism is clearly influenced
by Christian anti-Semitism. This concurs with other Judeo-Christian concepts
Asahara has adopted, such as the Last Judgment and the final battle of
Armageddon
<p>Asahara’s appreciation of the Jew’s intelligence and skills confirms
the findings of Kowner’s research on Japanese attitudes toward Jews, according
to which parallel to a rather positive image of Jews (seen as industrious,
competen, and strong-minded people) there is a more complex one, which
reveals the presence of suspicion and fear of Jews as individuals.[27]
<p>One of the main questions raised by the ideological and propaganda material
displayed on Aum’s websites is the absence of attacks on the United States,
in contrast to the earlier aggressive anti-Americanism of its publications
and public statements. This may reflect its leaders’ caution about direct
conflict with the superpower at a sensitive phase in Aum’s new organizational
expansion. The American journalist Charles Lee claims that “it is not fashionable
to attack America, so Jews become scapegoats.”[28] Neil Sandberg, director
of the American Jewish Committee's Pacific Rim Institute, argues that in
Japan frustration toward the West has been displaced by anti-Semitism,
which may have become “a strand of anti-Americanism.” Jews, as such, are
perceived as the “ultimate” or “quintessential” Westerner, the epitome
of all that is negative about the West.[29] It is possible that for pragmatic
reasons, the new Aum leadership has decided to use this dual image of the
Jews in order to advance its larger ideological and strategic goals.
<p>A final remark about the Russian component of Aum’s website. As noted
above, in addition to the material presented in English, there is a long
list of other anti-Semitic articles and attacks against the Jews. In contrast
to the poor language of the English texts, the Russian material is written
and probably printed in Russia. It also contains much graphic and photographic
material of old anti-Jewish Christian documents.
<p>The themes of these articles are closely related to false accusations
against Jews and anti-Semitic traditions in Russian history. The first
group, more general articles, “demonstrates” the wickedness of Judaism
and the Jews and their relationship with the Freemasons: “Old Sins of the
Jews,” “The Sanhedrin and the New Talmud,” “Jesus and the Pharisees,” and
so on. The second group is related to the Freemasons’ relations with, and
nefarious influence upon, nearly all Russia’s rulers. Other, more modern,
motifs also appear, such as “The Jewish Stain on Red Russia” and “Jewish
Testimonies on Behalf of the Bolsheviks.”
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>There are indications that Aum’s Russian branch which, when the cult
was outlawed in 1995 numbered some 30,000 members, has been attempting
to renew its activity, the large Russian ant-Semitic website being testimony
to this. The German edition of Aum’s Internet site could indicate that
the cult is seeking new grounds for expansion. Moreover, the cult has a
new date for Armageddon, the year 2003, which means that it might not be
far from a new wave of extremism.[30]
<p>In spite of the horrendous crimes perpetrated by its leaders and members
and the recommendations of the Japanese security authorities, Aum’s resurgence
as an active and aggressive cult represents a serious challenge in the
near future, which extends beyond the confines of Japan, the Japanese government
and people.

<p>18. Associated Press, 14 March 1999.
<p>19. The official Aum site domain is http://aum-internet.org<i>. </i>The
even<i> </i>bigger site (http://aum-shinrikyo.com), represents its ideology
and interests, although it claims to be a private website unaffiliated
to Aum.
<p>20. The German site is still in its initial stage and contains little
data.
<p>21. See “Devil's Nature: Matter,” a special interview with Master Asahara,
<i>Mahayan</i>a
31 (5 July 1990).
<p>22. See the text in http://www.aum-shinrikyo.com/english/index.htm.
It seems that many of the texts used in the websites date from the end
of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s.
<p>23. The original text was probably in Japanese and the translations
are in quite poor English.
<p>24. Maha Mudra is a Tibetan method of meditation developed from the
Tantric source, called also “the yoga of the great liberation.” or “the
yoga of the great symbol.”
<p>25. <i>Anti-Semitism Worldwide 1995/6</i>, pp. 262-3.
<p>26. Cited in the 9<sup>th</sup> Protocol as it appears on Aum’s site.
I owe this observation to Garry A Greenwood’s article, “Mahikari and Aum:
In the Grip of the Black Hand,” (http://www.rickross.com/reference/aum1.html).
Greenwood is an ex-member of another Japanese religious cult, Mahikari,
and according to him Aum Shinrikyo was influenced by Mahikari’s anti-Semitism.
<p>27. See Kowner, “On Ignorance, Respect and Suspicion,” p. 18.
<p>28. Ibid., p. 4. Kowner cites from Lee Charles, <i>Newsweek</i>, 16
May 1994.
<p>29. Ibid. Cited from Neil Sandberg, <i>Jewish World</i>, 12-18 May 1989.
<p>30. In his deposition in court, cited in the cult’s Internet site, Asahara
tried to prove that he did not consider the date of Armageddon as an absolute
truth, but rather an event whose “timing is subject to according to varying
social circumstances.”
