<P>Only lately has terrorism been recognized as<B> </B>a <I>strategic</I>
threat to the internal stability--and even survival--of countries. Terrorism
is now seen as a threat to the security of the whole international community,
including the United States, the only remaining super-power in the global
arena. The United States’ President, Ronald Reagan, was probably the first
political leader to understand the strategic role of terrorism, but he
considered it more in the framework of the Cold War between the two super-powers--a
tool in the hands of the Soviet Union, rather than a phenomena <I>per se</I>.
In Israel, the late prime minister Ytzhak Rabin declared&nbsp; in 1995,
for the first time, that terrorism represents a strategic threat, but only
in the framework of the peace-process between Israel and the Palestinians.
Subsequent events: the suicide bombings by Hamas and the tragic assassination
of Rabin himself, have shown the truth of this statement. U.S. Secretary
of Defense William Cohen declared upon his nomination that non-conventional
terrorism will present the main strategic threat for the U.S. in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century.

<P>Intelligence in the field of counter-terrorism is a different--and in
many aspects a more arduous and difficult--task than the classical military
and political intelligence against enemy or rival states. The lives of
many people are in continual danger, often in real time during the very
work of the intelligence agencies. The rules of the game are cruel, for
the security personnel and for the terrorists themselves. The moral and
ethical problems are more intricate. Therefore, the security and intelligence
agencies involved in the fight against terrorism must work in a peculiar
environment and must cope with problems not encountered in other fields
of intelligence.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="90s trends"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Trends in Terrorism in the
1990's</FONT></B>

<P>In order to evaluate the threats posed by terrorism at the beginning
of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century it is necessary to sum up and analyze the
main trends of the terrorism of the 1990s

<P>Statistically, while the number of <I>international</I> terrorist attacks
has decreased, the <I>lethality</I> of the attacks has increased dramatically.
The suicide and car-bomb attacks are one of the main methods used to achieve
this goal. The truck-bombs used in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salam against the
American embassies are only the latest example. The radical Islamic groups
have become during the 1990s the main perpetrators of international terrorism.

<P>Terrorism as a tool in political or ethnic conflicts has spread to new
areas, mainly to Russia and the ex-Soviet republics and the volume of internal
terrorism has sharply increased in many Arab and Muslim countries (Algeria,
Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc.)

<P>The first real non-conventional terrorist event, the sarin gas used
by the Aum Shinrikyo cult in March 1995 for the attack in the Tokyo subway,
has broken the taboo in the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and
this is a very significant event and precedent in the history of modern
terrorism.

<P>The United States has been for the first time the theater of major terrorist
attacks - The World Trade Center in New York and Oklahoma City bombings
- and also the country where a major right-wing terrorist attack took place
- in Oklahoma. In Europe there were only many minor incidents<B> </B>involving
right-wing extremists.

<P>The number of states sponsoring or supporting terrorism has indeed diminished,
mainly as a result of the crumbling of the Communist Block and the firm
stand of the American administration towards rogue states. However, Iran,
Syria and lately Afghanistan continue to present a threat to their regional
neighbors and the international community.

<P>The radical left-wing terrorism of the 1970s and 1980s in South America
and Europe has almost completely disappeared or has been eradicated.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="track record"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Track Record of Intelligence
in the Last Decade</FONT></B>

<P>How have the intelligence agencies of the various countries involved,
and the international intelligence community as a whole, coped with these
events and trends of the 1990s?

<P>Taking into consideration the number of very serious incidents which
have occurred, it seems that in spite of all the efforts deployed by the
security and intelligence services they have failed to give the right answer
to some of the challenges posed by the new terrorist actors.

<P>The identity of the perpetrators of some major terrorist attacks, such
as the bombings of the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community building
in Buenos Aires, as well as the bombing of the American military personnel
at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, is still unknown. Even those responsible
for the deadly car-bomb attacks against the American Marines headquarters
and the French military camp in Beirut in 1983, have not been yet identified
and punished.

<P>Major terrorist attacks have taken the intelligence agencies by surprise.
This is true of&nbsp; the US, but also of Egypt, Israel and others. The
major<B> </B>strategic<B> </B>surprise though was the sarin gas attack
in Tokyo, although one might say that “the handwriting was on the wall”
and little was done by the Japanese authorities to prevent it.

<P>For the moment it would seem that the various security services have
not found the correct response to the suicide attacks.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="successes"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Intelligence Successes</FONT></B>

<P>However, there were also major successes and breakthroughs:

<P>The US has invested a significant effort in identifying, tracking down
and bringing to justice the perpetrators of terrorist activities against
American citizens and interests. The identification and arrest of Ramzi
Youssef, responsible for organizing the World Trade Center bombing, and
other wanted terrorists responsible for past or present activities, are
witness to the American tenacity in using intelligence in the fight against
terrorism. France has done the same with the most famous international
terrorist of the 1970s, Carlos<B>, </B>extradited from Sudan.<B> </B>Germany
has achieved the extradition or the arrest of some of the terrorists responsible
for assassinations or hijackings in the 1970s and 1980s. Japan has also
invested significant effort to bring to justice members of the Japanese
Red Army which acted abroad, mainly in the Middle East.

<P>Many terrorist attacks have been prevented or foiled, but successes
of intelligence services generally are not published. In one known case
at least, the swift FBI deployment after the World Trade Center bombing
and its infiltration of the group involved, foiled a much greater plan
to bomb the United Nations building and the Lincoln tunnel in New York.

<P>From the organizational point of view, the security and intelligence
agencies have taken serious steps to improve their capabilities. The FBI
has tripled its counter-terrorism force after the World Trade Center attack
and the CIA has created a Terrorism Warning Group to deal with the threat
at the highest civilian and military level. The German authorities have
greatly enhanced the police and security units dealing, successfully it
must be said, with the right-wing violent activities. Russia has formed
new elite units in order to cope with the threat of terrorist attacks against
its nuclear facilities, and so on.

<P>The<B> </B>international cooperation<B> </B>has improved, mainly on
the bilateral level. Even the Israeli Security Service is cooperating,
with all the existing limitations, with the various Palestinian apparatuses.
A new European body, Europol, is a step in the improvement of cooperation
at the regional level. The Arab League countries have arrived to an agreement
to coordinate their intelligence and security activities against the radical
Islamist movements, although Israel is still considered by them as a legitimate
target for the same movements.

<P><A NAME="modern terrorism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Trends in Modern Terrorism</FONT></B>

<P>The question now is what lies ahead in the way of terrorist threats
and what responses must the intelligence agencies prepare in order to foil
or at least minimize these threats. First, let us take a look at the new
trends in modern terrorism:

<P>In the estimation of most of the analysts, researchers--and of the main
intelligence services-- terrorism will continue to be a serious threat
in the next decade on the strategic and tactical level. The continuous
and growing instability of the international environment on the economic,
social and political level; the impossibility of attaining a new balance
of power in the international system; the extensive technological changes,
combined with the millennium<B> </B>anxiety--all these factors will provide
a fertile ground for the old, and probably also the new kind of organizations,
such as radical ecological or abortionist movements or various esoteric
cults and sects.

<P>Ethnic conflicts, as those in the former Soviet Union (especially the
Caucasus), Yugoslavia and in various parts of Africa, seem to be increasing,
in spite of positive developments, as witnessed by the peace agreement
in Northern Ireland or the cease-fires announced by ETA in Spain and the
PKK in Turkey. The appearance of what some researchers call “the gray zones”
like Somalia and some regions in Central Africa, where there is no real
representation of democratic countries or international agencies, turns
these regions into a kind of intelligence vacuum, where terrorist organizations
can find a safe-haven and a basis<B> </B>for future activity. These development
represent a real threat not only to the neighboring counties, but also
to the industrialized democratic ones. Osama bin Laden's boasts about his
role in ousting the Western forces from Somalia was not mere bragadocio.

<P>The strategic<B> </B>assassination of important leaders during key political
moments could continue, as has occurred in the past with Sadat and the
attempts on president Mubarak of Egypt, the assassination of Indhira and
Rajib Gandhi in India, the plan to kill the Pope, or the assassination
of prime minister Rabin in Israel.

<P>Right-wing radicals will probably continue to expand the strategy of
what they call<B> </B>“leaderless resistance,” whereby militants and groups
operate<B> </B>independently of each other, without reporting to a central
headquarters or single leader for direction or instruction. This strategy
has proved itself in the Oklahoma City bombing and could be adopted by
new radical left-wing groups, as results from their discussion of this
concept on the Internet.

<P>The use of<B> </B>the Internet and the computer networks will represent
a major challenge in the near future.&nbsp; Such use could include use
of the nets not only as a propaganda tool, but also as a means of communication
between militants of terrorist organizations and between various organizations.
Organizations can also use the net for fundraising, transferring of money
and other organizational needs; and last but not least, for waging cyber-attacks
on the essential civilian and military facilities of the “enemies.”

<P>Regarding other types of non-conventional weapons, terrorists are less
likely to use chemical and biological weapons than conventional explosives.
However, the likelihood that terrorists may use chemical and biological
materials may increase over the next decade. Chemical and biological agents
are less likely to be used than conventional explosives, at least partly
because they are more difficult to weaponize and the results are unpredictable.
Although the likelyhood of terrorists’ use of chemical and biological weapons
is low, some groups and individuals are beginning to show interest in such
weapons, as shown by bin Laden’s interest in acquiring such capabilities.
The threat of nuclear terrorism is even less certain, but some kind of
threat or low grade attack, such as the one tried by the Chechen rebels
in the forest surrounding Moscow using radioactive materials, is not unfeasible.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="tasks"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Tasks Facing Intelligence</FONT></B>

<P>In light of the above threats and trends, what will be the task of the
security and intelligence services and how they can better cover the large
array of terrorist groups and organizations?

<P>To begin with, the threat of large scale acts of terror and the potential
of non-conventional terrorism will enhance the need to prevent and foil
the terrorist schemes and give<B> </B>warning<B> </B>before such acts happen.
In the case of chemical or nuclear terrorism without warning even the first-responder
teams could be destroyed before they act; in case of biological threat
the early warning could at least permit the immunization of the population
endangered.

<P>Secondly, the existence of small groups and cells of<B> </B>highly motivated
religious extremists, right-wing fanatics, unpredictable esoteric or millenarian
cults, which in many senses act anarchically, means that the work of penetration
and infiltration of these groups is highly difficult. The case of the assassin
of the late prime minister Rabin is an example of the problematic posed
by these groups.

<P><B>Humint</B>
<BR>From the above it follows that the use of human sources, professionally
known as Humint, should be expanded and perfected: the counter-terrorism
expertise, the cultural knowledge and the language aptitudes of Humint
officers should be improved. The dealing with composite multi-national
groups like the one formed by Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman in the U.S. or bin
Laden’s Islamic World Front for Fighting Jews and Crusaders, or the kind
of cults as Aum Shinrikyo<B> </B>represent a formidable challenge in the
way to penetration. The inconclusive results of the American cruise-missiles
strikes against bin Laden’s camps in Afghanistan and the pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan are only a fresh example of the importance of good human
sources in the heart of terrorist organizations.

<P><B>Open Sources</B>
<BR>Open sources<B> </B>are important because they provide context as well
as warning or tip-off. Terrorist organizations have ideological programs
and they need to explain to their sympathizers and the public at large
their goals and targets. In the age of Internet and open media there is
need for a careful examination and analysis of all the available material.
Often, intelligence agencies dealing with terrorism neglect the importance
of this kind of information. It is perhaps the field in which it is the
duty of the academia and the university researchers to take care of and
to advance the knowledge of terrorist ideologies, doctrines and strategies.

<P><B>The Internet</B>
<BR>The Internet will become more and more the place were much of the virtual,
but also conspirative activity will take place. One of the problems with
which the security services will have to deal will be the encoding of the
communications<B> </B>between militants of terrorist cells and groups.
The American administration has not succeeded in preventing the proliferation
to clandestine organizations of the PGP system of ciphering. For instance
a radical right wing group, the Thule Netz in Germany, used sophisticated
ciphering and had eight levels of encoding before reaching the highest
echelons of their net.

<P><B>Non-conventional Terrorism</B>
<BR>As regards the proliferation of non-conventional means of warfare,
particularly to the extent that it may touch terrorism and affect the security
of whole countries, the next decade will certainly present the intelligence
agencies with the most formidable task. The challenge in this case is double:
on the one hand the necessity of penetrating and monitoring the activities
in this sensitive field of the various groups and organizations; on the
other, to spot, monitor and neutralize the providers of raw materials,
technology and know-how used in the preparation of such weapons. This mission
is connected with the overall task of preventing the proliferation of WMD
to rogue states, but in many senses it is more intricate.

<P><B>International Cooperation</B>
<BR>It is accepted axiom today that the<B> </B>cooperation<B> </B>on the
bilateral, regional and international levels is essential in preventing
and neutralizing not only international terrorism, but also internal terrorism
in many countries. Terrorism in Algeria, Egypt, Sri Lanka, etc. is closely
connected with the activity of exiled militants and front organizations
in other countries or the raising of funds by expatriated so called humanitarian
organizations. Without a sincere and close cooperation between the various
countries in the intelligence field, every one will become at one timeor
another victim of terrorism, and examples of the past are well known. There
is urgent need for an international legislation concerning terrorism.

<P>Nevertheless it must be clear that the activity of the intelligence
agencies and the international cooperation will be affected and influenced
by the international environment: the new international laws and human
rights necessities; the political limitations of the various countries
as regarding the definition of terrorism; the threat of expansion of conflicts
to other countries and the fear of more innocent victims in case of an
external involvement.

<P><A NAME="summary"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Summary</FONT></B>

<P>To sum up, the intelligence work against terrorism in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century will be an arduous and complicated task, which will necessitate
a close look to the new social and technological developments, an objective
analysis of the new trends and threats, and much vision.

<P>Intelligence is essential in countering terrorism, in diminishing its
tactical effects and strategic importance. Yet, without a comprehensive,
intelligent and firm policy of the governments involved terrorism will
continue to present a real threat to the future generation.
