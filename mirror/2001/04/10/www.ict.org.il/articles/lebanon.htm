Lebanon over the fate of Hizballah in the wake of the Implementation of
Resolution 425</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>One of the main criteria in the Israeli initiative to implement resolution
425, and of the Israeli cabinet decision of April 1st, is the dismantling
of the military capabilities of Hizballah, and the other terror organizations,
and the cessation of their terror activities from Lebanese territory against
Israel. So far the Lebanese have refrained from dealing with this aspect
of the Israeli initiative, problematic as it is from their point of view.
Instead, they have chosen to place all their efforts - under Syrian orchestration
- to negating the initiative as a whole. Recently, there have been some
interesting developments in the debate over the Israeli initiative, when
Iran, whose control over Hizballah makes it an important player in Lebanese
internal politics, entered the fray.

<P>It all started when Atallah Mohagerani, Iranian Culture and Islamic
Guidance Minister, and Iran’s government spokesman, called a press conference
on 28th March at the Iranian Embassy in Paris. Mohagerani stated that if
Israel were to withdraw from Lebanon under provisions of secure and final
borders between Israel and Lebanon, there would be no further need for
the activities of the so called “Resistance”, meaning of course, Hizballah.
In this case, said Mohagerani, Hizballah would continue to exist as a political
party, and would focus instead on political and cultural activity within
the framework of internal Lebanese politics. But, of course, it would give
up its military apparatus and activities.

<P>This interesting, and important, remark of Mohagerani’s stands in direct
contradiction to the public message so enthusiastically sown by Hizballah
leaders. According to this position, even if the IDF withdraws unilaterally,
Hizballah gives no guarantee to refrain from anti-Israeli terrorist activity
from Lebanon. After all, according to Hizballah, the problem is not only
the "liberation" of Lebanon, but also “occupied Palestine”; the decision
to abstain from terrorism or not is to be reserved as a "secret bargaining
chip" for future political developments. Mohagerani’s statement, widely
quoted by the Lebanese and Arab media, contrasted sharply with official
Hizballah propaganda. All this threw Hizballah into an unprecedented contradiction
between its own official stance (compounded in Tehran, not Beirut) and
the declaration of an Iranian minister, close to Iranian president Khatami,
and serving as his government’s official mouthpiece.

<P>We have no way of knowing how Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, General Secretary
of Hizballah, and the other leaders of Hizballah reacted upon waking up
on morning of March 28th to the words of the Iranian Minister of Culture
on “Radio Lebanon”. Presumably their consternation quickly reached Tehran
and Iran’s Foreign Minister, Dr. Kamal Harazi, who aat the time, was visiting
Beirut and Damascus. Dr. Harazi tried to minimize the damage caused by
his colleague’s statement, without blatantly contradicting him. In his
visits to Damascus and Beirut, Harazi violently attacked the Israeli initiative
for implementing Security Council resolution 425, while at the same time
addressing the question of what becomes of Hizballah after the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon. Reacting to the Minister of Culture’s statement,
Harazi explained that in the event of an IDF withdrawal, Hizballah would
have achieved the goal for which it is fighting. However the continuation
of “the Resistance”, (here read, the fate of Hizballah and its terrorism
from Lebanon) will depend on “the government and the people of Lebanon”
(M.B.C. television, 29.3.98). On another occasion, in Beirut, Harazi pointed
out that if the IDF withdraws from Lebanon, Hizballah would have achieved
one - but only one - of its goals. Harazi refused to answer reporters'
questions of whether in such a case Hizballah will cease its military activities
and disarm. Such questions must be answered by Hizballah and the Lebanese
government, he said (“The Daily Star” 31.3.98).

<P>In contrast to Harazi’s cautious reaction, the head of Hizballa’s political
bureau, Hajj Hussein Khalil, after meeting with Harazi in Damascus, was
more outspoken. Concerning the question of Hizballah disarmament, Khalil
told Radio Monte Carlo (29.3.98), “we have not the slightest doubt that
no individual or factor would dare to give security guarantees or to touch
the “holy arms . . .’” (a veiled threat, which Lebanese President Elas
Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri are
sure to understand the meaning of.).

<P>Iranian Foreign Minister Harazi’s innocuous remark that the fate of
Hizballah is an internal Lebanese issue, to be determined by the government
and “people of Lebanon” (a bare hint that governmental decree is not enough
. . .), cannot but seem ridiculous to even the most inexperienced Lebanese
politician. Ridiculous too is Hassan Nasrallah's interpretation that what
Harazi meant by saying that the fate of Hizballah is "a Lebanese matter"
is that the matter will be decided by the leadership of Hizballah (Radio
Monte Carlo 2.4.98). Everyone in Lebanon knows who finances, equips, and
arms the Hizballah, and from whom they receive their instructions. These
words certainly failed to convince George Alam, senior commentator to the
popular Lebanese newspaper “al-Safir”, who in his commentary on March 30
wrote of Tehran’s role and influence in Lebanon. Alam called to Harazi,
in his first official visit to Lebanon, to bring matters “honestly and
unequivocally” out into the open. Hizballah is, indeed a Lebanese organization,
receiving a good deal of official and popular Lebanese support, wrote Alam,
but at the same time, Hizballah has “known and recognized regional ties”
(dependence on Iran and Syria, in the code of the Lebanese media). In the
light of this, says the commentator, the question before Lebanon is, “if
Israel withdraws in accordance with resolution 425, what happens to the
‘Resistance’? Does it continue its activities or not?” According to Alam,
“part of the answer to this question is to be found in Beirut, while part
will be found in Damascus, and Tehran.” The Lebanese journalist goes on
to say that, “there are things in this context that official Lebanon needs
to hear from Dr. Harazi, who arrives in Beirut through the Syrian gate.”
(Meaning, in Lebanese journalistic jargon, that Harazi’s arrival to Beirut
from Damascus is no accident.)

<P>Hazem Saghia, a well-known Lebanese journalist who writes for "Al-Hayat",
published in London, could allow himself even more eloquence and lucidity.
In an article entitled "But what is Hizballah?" Saghia exhibits Mohagerani's
declaration as an expression of the aspirations of Iran's new president
Mahmed Khatami to normalize relations with the rest of the world and to
get closer to Washington. Saghia points out that Mohagerani's remarks brought
up a matter that hitherto had been taboo; namely, what will really happen
to Hizballah once Israel withdraws from Lebanon? In this context, Saghia
examines the question of whether Hizballah can really be considered a legitimate
national liberation movement. His conclusion - one that the Lebanese are
well aware of, though forbidden to express publicly - that Hizballah is
not, nor ever has been a legitimate national movement, stems from two main
considerations. To begin with, the organization refrains from stating unequivocally
that once the IDF leaves Lebanon, Hizballah will have lost its raison d'etre
as a military power. Instead, Hizballah is a tool for Syria and Iran for
achieving their own, non-Lebanese, goals. And secondly, Hizballah is an
organization with an ethnic identity. An organization identified with part
of the Shiite sect and serving Iranian and Syrian aspirations cannot be
said to be an authentic Lebanese national movement.

<P>And so, in addition to the intensive preoccupation with negating the
Israeli initiative to implement security resolution 425, Lebanon must now
deal with some thorny questions: How to explain to the residents of southern
Lebanon, suffering from the continual warfare, Lebanon’s refusal to arrive
at a reasonable arrangement until Syria - who is enjoying peace and quiet
on the Golan Heights - can get its affairs settled. How to explain to Lebanese
and Arab public opinion, not to mention the rest of the world, why Lebanon
refuses to arrive at the security arrangements that would enable the IDF
to finally withdraw from southern Lebanon, in accordance with that same
resolution 425 that Lebanon is continually waving about? How to resolve
the contradiction between the basic national interest of the Lebanese authority
- any Lebanese authority, even the current pro-Syrian one - that its control
should extend to all parts of Lebanon, and Hizballah’s interest to preserve
its military capability and its control over some areas of Lebanon including
the South? How to react to the threats by Hizballah's leaders against leading
Lebanese statesmen, including President Hrawi, lest they should dare to
arrive at security agreements with Israel on the basis of resolution 425?

<P>Iran’s entry into the debate over the implementation of Security Council
resolution 425 has brought out into the open some fundamental but heretofore
hidden questions about Hizballah's identity and future in the Lebanese
arena, and the fate of its militia and military apparatus. These questions
will not be solved by Hizballah itself. Rather, they will be resolved in
Damascus and in Tehran, a fact known and understood by Hizballah's Secretary
General, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah. So far, in his frequent public statements,
Nasrallah has been at pains to bury these questions in a thick fog. Iran’s
Foreign Minister and Minister of Culture in their various, albeit contradictory
statements, have dispersed this fog once and for all. They’ve made it clear
to Nasrallah and the entire Lebanese public that Hizballah, in its present
form, is living on borrowed time, and that as soon as the political circumstances
are right, the fate of Hizballah will be the same as that of the other
militias disbanded under the Taif Agreement of 1989.

<P>The Lebanese government and Hizballah are following events closely.
Hizballah, for the first time, finds itself in need of defending its legitimacy
and future. The frequent defensive declarations of Sheikh Nasrallah and
the leaders of Hizballah serve to emphasize the fact that the organization
is under tremendous pressure. While Lebanese leaders continue to publicly
reject the Israeli initiative, presumably behind the scenes they’ll need
to address themselves, with all due thoughtfulness and caution, to the
questions that it has raised (in perfect harmony, of course with “Big Sister”
Syria). In their heart of hearts they must know that of all possible ways
out of the present situation, the Israeli initiative alone can guarantee
the withdrawal of the IDF from Lebanon, the return of Lebanese sovereignty
to southern Lebanon and an end to the suffering of its inhabitants. Compared
to the other alternatives, it's the best offer that Lebanon is going to
get in the Middle East political market.
