<p><b>PSS Structure and Organization</b>
<p>The General Security Service (GSS) was established in May 1994 with
the signing by Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) of the Cairo Agreement
on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area (see Appendix II); the official
title of the GSS is the Palestinian Directorate of Police Force, and in
the Cairo agreement it is referred to simply as the “Palestinian Police.”
In actuality, this term is misleading. The GSS is the umbrella organization
nominally responsible for coordinating and maintaining most of the Palestinian
security bodies and services--it includes not only police but also intelligence
organizations. The GSS has a director general, Nasr Yusef, but the supreme
commander is the chairman of the PA, Yasir Arafat. There are two separate
headquarters, for Gaza and the West Bank; each operates independently.
The GSS coordinates nine administrative departments responsible for training,
logistics, communication, finance and political guidance. On the operational
level it coordinates ten services. The two additional services, the Special
Security Force (SSF) and al-Amn al-Ri’asah (Presidential Security), operate
directly under Arafat’s guidance (see the organizational table). According
to the Oslo Accords, however, the GSS should be the highest, and only,
security authority under which all the other services would operate. Together,
the GSS, SSF, and al-Amn al-Ri’asah constitute the Palestinian Security
Services (PSS).
<p><b>GSS Security Branches</b>
<p>The ten services that fall under the rubric of the GSS include the
<p>following:
<ul>
<li>
National Security Force (Quwat al-Amn al-Watani). As the largest security
service, with more than 14,000 officers, the National Security Force (NSF)
is responsible for most of the missions along the borders of “Area A“ (see
map, p. 26) and inside the cities. Among these missions are the Israeli-Palestinian
Joint Patrols (JPs), guarding checkpoints on the cities’ outskirts, and
participating in other general security-related missions. The NSF recruited
most of its officers from the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) and gradually
added increasing numbers of local recruits. Gen. Nasr Yusef formerly commanded
the NSF; its current commander is Saeb Ajez. This branch was first officially
included in the GSS (as “Public Security“) in the May 1994 Cairo Agreement
(see Appendix II).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Civil Police (al-Shurta Madaniyya). The Civil Police, also known as the
Blue Police, is the main law enforcement tool in the PA. Like the NSF,
it was one of the original branches of the GSS mentioned in the Cairo Agreement.
The Civil Police handles ordinary police functions such as directing traffic,
arresting common criminals, and keeping public order. Headed by Ghazi Jubali,
it employs more than 10,000 police officers in the West Bank and Gaza.
According to the September 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip- “Oslo II “-the Civil Police will also deploy in twenty-five
selected villages throughout the West Bank commonly known as “Area B+.
“ (Palestinians are generally not allowed to carry firearms in Area B,
but officers in these villages are allowed to patrol, to carry firearms
within the village territory, and to maintain public order.) The Civil
Police also spearheads a 700-officer rapid-deployment special police unit
that is trained to handle complex crises, such as severe riots and counterterrorism
operations. Commanders of the unit received training in the former Soviet
Union, and one of their important roles is to train instructors for the
other GSS units.[l]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Preventive Security Force (<i>al-Amn al-Wiqa’i</i>). This plainclothes
security force operates in the West Bank and Gaza with an estimated power
of close to 5,000 agents and is known to be the largest of the PA’s intelligence
forces. The PSF was first officially included in the GSS as part of Oslo
II. Headed by Col. Jibril Rajoub in the West Bank and Col. Muhammad Dahlan
in Gaza, this body is involved in preventive actions against terrorist
and opposition groups as well as information gathering in Israel. Some
of the PSF activities are associated with violence, abduction of civilians,
interrogations, torture, and other illegal actions; indeed, the PSF has
achieved a reputation for human rights violations including the death of
tortured detainees.[2]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>General Intelligence (<i>Mukhabbarat al-Amma</i>)</b>. Headed by Maj.
Gen. Amin al-Hindi, the Mukhabbarat is the official PA intelligence agency
and was one of the original branches of the GSS, as delineated in the Cairo
Agreement. With a current strength of about 3,000 officers, the Mukhabbarat
is involved in intelligence gathering inside and outside the territories,
counterespionage operations, and developing relations with other foreign
intelligence bodies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Military Intelligence (<i>Istkhabbarat al-Askariyya</i>)</b>. A smaller
intelligence body headed by Musa Arafat, the Istkhabbarat is a preventive
apparatus that deals mainly with arrests and interrogations of opposition
activists who might endanger the stability of the regime. This body also
investigates some of the illegal actions of the PA’s other intelligence
and security bodies. The Istkhabbarat is mentioned in neither the Cairo
Agreement nor Oslo II and is one of the PSS’s five unofficially recognized
bodies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Military Police</b>. A subordinate body to the Istkhabbarat, the Military
Police specializes in riot control, arrests, protection of important people
and important installations, prison maintenance, and enforcement of order
and discipline among the security bodies. Like the Istkhabbarat, this unit
is not officially recognized in the Oslo Accords.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Coast Guard (<i>Shurta Bahariyya</i>)</b>. This elite unit deployed
mainly in Gaza consists of about 1,000 officers. Its official objective
is the protection of the PA’s territorial water mainly against arms- and
drug-smugglers from Egypt. It owns five motorboats equipped with machine
guns. Most of the members are recruits from the Palestinian diaspora who
used to belong to the overseas naval unit of Fatah, Arafat’s inner circle
within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Upon their arrival
to the PA areas, they received special commando training, making the unit
highly valuable and able to deal with dangerous challenges. The Coast Guard
is one of the original units designated in the Cairo Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Aerial Police (<i>Shurta al-Jawiya</i>)</b>. A rudimentary aerial unit
based on Force 14, Fatah’s aviation unit, the Aerial Police is responsible
for operating and maintaining the PA’s five helicopters, which are used
mainly for the transportation of Arafat and other Palestinian leaders.
This unit is not, however, mentioned in any of the agreements.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Civil Defense (<i>al-Difa’a al-Madani</i>)</b>. Described officially
in the Cairo Agreement as Emergency Services and Rescue (see Appendix II),
Civil Defense consists of fire department and rescue services, which it
coordinates in conjunction with other civilian services during emergencies.
In normal times the body administers a massive program of first aid and
rescue training for the civilian population.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>County Guard (<i>al-Amn al-Mahafza</i>)</b>. This small force supplies
security services to the county governors and their offices. The County
Guard summons people for questioning and resolves local quarrels. It is
not officially mentioned in any of the agreements to date.</li>
</ul>
<b>Additional Security</b>
<p>Despite the Cairo Agreement’s definition of the GSS as the highest and
only security authority, Arafat also created two additional apparati outside
GSS control and accountable only to the PA chairman himself. These units
are the SSF and al-Amn al-Ri’asah.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Special Security Force (<i>al-Amal-Khass</i>)</b>. The Special Security
Force (SSF) is headed by Gen. Abu Yusuf al-Wahidi. It is the newest of
the services (established January 1995) and probably the smallest. Its
importance is great, however, as it works under Arafat’s direct supervision.
Although officially its main objective is to gather information about the
activities of opposition groups in foreign countries, especially Arab ones,
its actual function may be to gather information on the PA’s other security
services.(3) The SSF also supplies Arafat with information about any corruption
and illegal actions by PA officials. Technically, however, the SSF is not
mentioned in any of the agreements.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Presidential Security (<i>al-Amn al-Ri’asah</i>)</b>. Al-Amn al-Ri’asah
is a high-quality security force commanded by Faisal Abu Sharah and estimated
at 3,000 officers, a majority of whom were once members of Force 17, Arafat’s
security guard while he led the PLO in the diaspora. It is responsible
for Arafat’s personal security and operates under his direction, although,
as originally defined in Oslo II, the unit was to be part of the GSS. The
protection of the chairman, as well as other political personalities and
important installations, is the main objective of al-Amn al-Ri’asah, but
in addition it handles counterterrorism and is responsible for arresting
opposition activists and suspects of collaboration with Israel. Two subsidiary
bodies of al-Amn al-Ri’asah are the Intelligence Unit, whose main mission
is information gathering about the activities of the opposition movements
and other domestic threats, and the Presidential Guard, Arafat’s most loyal
and trusted inner circle. This latter unit provides the tight security
around him, preventing any assassination attempts. Although officially
Force 17 disbanded when Arafat returned to Gaza, the background of most
of the officers in al-Amn al Ri’asah leads most Palestinians to refer to
this branch simply as Force 17.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Prominent Features and Personalities</b>
<p>The most prominent features of the PSS are the proliferation of its
units and the difficulty of defining their different functions. There are,
for example, eight different bodies dealing with intelligence and anti-opposition
related activities. Their overlapping responsibilities often lead to street
clashes, confusion, inefficient work, and-in more extreme cases-battles
over blurred jurisdictions.(4) Coordinating the services to prevent such
unfortunate events is complicated because Arafat built the forces in such
a manner that only the PA chairman could arbitrate between them, following
the famous strategy of “divide and rule.“
<p>Three distinct groups of generals are represented in the security establishment.
The first consists of PLA veterans who arrived in the territories in 1994
as part of the Oslo Accords and were soon appointed to some of the most
senior positions; these men include Nasr Yusef, commander of the GSS; Abdel
al-Razzak Majaideh, commander of the GSS’s Gaza units; and Ziad al-Atrash,
representative to the Liaison Security Committee with the Israelis. These
generals, all PLA leaders, brought with them varying levels of military
experience, but the fact that they were “outsiders“ who did not actively
participate in the Palestinian intifada (uprising) affected their credibility
and status in Palestinian society.
<p>Strong popular support was given to the second group of leaders, including
Jibril Rajoub and Muhammad Dahlan, who represent the heritage of the Palestinian
struggle for independence during the intifada. Rajoub, who spent a total
of sixteen years in Israeli prisons, was one of the original leaders of
Fatah in the West Bank wing of the United National Leadership of the Uprising
(UNLU). Dahlan was arrested eleven times by the Israeli security forces
when he was the Gaza leader of the Fatah Shabiba (youth) movement. Both
Rajoub and Dahlan were deported in 1988 and their life stories are resplendent
with Palestinian heroism and struggle. A wave of popular support, which
surpassed by far the support for the PLA generals, accompanied their 1994
return to the territories. Support for these two leaders has been diminishing
lately since the PSF, which they command, has been associated with many
cases of human rights violations, violence, and intimidation; among other
incidents, Rajoub apparently ordered the PSF to harass Palestinian politicians
through violent means.(5) Yet, his controversial image evokes a mixture
of awe and admiration, and he has even been mentioned as a possible successor
to Arafat.
<p>In his effort to maneuver between the two schools of commanders, Arafat
gradually introduced a third group of officers, who were brought to the
territories from abroad to command the more sensitive security bodies.
The main figure in this category is Brig. Gen. Amin al-Hindi, head of the
Mukhabbarat, who had “disappeared“ after his involvement in the 1972 massacre
of Israeli athletes in the Munich Olympics. Other commanders in this third
category are Abu Yusuf al-Wahidi, commander of the SSF; Faisal Abu Sharah,
who commands al-Amn al-Ri&amp;rsquo;asah; and Ghazi Jubali, commander of
the Civil Police in Gaza. All of the above officers are known to be extremely
loyal to Arafat, and this could explain why he entrusted to them his most
important security bodies.
<p>Looking again at the whole picture, it seems that Arafat, by keeping
his security forces under the command of a heterogeneous group of generals
who are often at odds with each other, has managed to prevent the formation
of a cohesive general staff with excessive power, along the lines of those
responsible for the overthrow of so many Arab regimes in the Middle East.
<p>One can discern two primary reasons for the abundance of intelligence-related
services-one that answers “why“ and the other “how.“ As to why, the PA
must constantly monitor and be wary of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad to diminish the political threat they pose. The intelligence services
therefore represent Arafat’s emphasis on counteropposition and counterterrorist
activities and his attempt to weaken Islamist activists as much as he can.
More important, and in answer to how Arafat has increased the size of his
force, intelligence officers are mostly plainclothes agents who look and
dress like regular civilians. The PA can thus greatly inflate the number
of security personnel without apparently violating the interim agreement
quotas on employing police officers.
<p>As for training, each of the security services recruits and trains its
own men. It started as a training system in which, according to GSS commander
General Yusef, “every unit is improvising.“[6] In time, however, it turned
into a continuously improving system with several training bases in Gaza
and the West Bank. Although Britain, Austria, the Netherlands, Egypt, and
Scandinavian nations have all helped to train some of the men, the PSS
as a whole still lacks the resources for an extensive program. Training
usually runs from ten days to one month of intensive courses. For more
elite units like al-Amn al-Ri’asah, the training is three months.[7] Daily
contact with the IDF has also had a positive influence on the quality of
the Palestinian forces. Although Israel was never directly involved in
the instruction of Palestinian forces, it was only natural that the NSF,
for example, simply by operating alongside a well-equipped standing army
like the IDF, would soon be tempted to emulate and adopt many of the Israelis’
drills and techniques. These included new disciplinary measures, battle
drills, ways to operate radio equipment, and regulations for handling weapons.
This constant improvement-by-emulation had a positive effect on the improved
operational capabilities of the PSS.
<p><b>Police or Rudimentary Army?</b>
<p>In assessing whether the Palestinian Security Services (PSS) constitute
a police force or a rudimentary army, one should specify the standards
and definitions according to which the issue will be addressed. A police
force is generally defined as “an organized civil force for maintaining
order, preventing and detecting crime, and enforcing the law.“[8] But a
military force differsfrom a police force. It refers to an armed body with
the objective of protecting territorial borders, skies, and coasts of the
state from external threats, and in many cases also against domestic threats.
Although both police and military forces are armed establishments, they
also have some major structural differences. Military organizations employ
armed personnel organized in formations of varying sizes, starting from
small platoons and companies, continuing through the intermediate level
of battalions and regiments, and culminating in formations with thousands
of men at the levels of division and corps. All military bodies are managed
by means of a general staff that coordinates the work of the different
units. The general staff is responsible for the deployment and operations
of the forces during times of war and peace. Its mandate is to direct military
operations according to the instructions and directives of the political
leadership. Apart from the combat units, the general staff directs the
work of the professional corps such as signal, surgeon, logistic, and personnel
branches. Finally, a military force is characterized by a well-developed
officer corps-the backbone of the military organization-which is responsible
for recruiting and training soldiers for the military units. In light of
the above differentiation-rather than in terms of weaponization[9] or military
goals-this chapter will consider which definition best describes the PSS
in its present form: police, or rudimentary army?
<p><b>A Police Force?</b>
<p>The Cairo Agreement first allowed the Palestinian Authority (PA) to
establish a state security apparatus that includes police and internal
security forces (see Appendix II). The goal of this police force, according
to Article III of the security arrangement protocol, was to create an atmosphere
of public order and internal security during the interim period. The agreement
also limited to 9,000 the number of Palestinians to be employed by the
security services. The agreed-upon number rose to 30,000 by December 1995
as a result of the Oslo II Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Yet, many analysts assert that the PSS is not complying with these
quantitative limitations and that the actual number of security personnel
employed in the different branches varies from 35,000-according to more
cautious estimates-up to 50,000.[10] If true, the PA has anywhere from
5,000 to 20,000 more officers deployed than the accords allow. In fact,
a June 1998 intelligence report submitted to the Israeli government, detailing
alleged Palestinian breaches of the Oslo Accords, included as one of the
main issues a list of the names of PSS officers, which the PA submitted
to the Israeli government. The PA did not submit a complete list, but instead
named only 18,600, for two reasons: It does not want Israel to know the
real number of officers employed, and it does not want Israel to know their
identities, as some are former terrorists who are wanted in Israel.[11]
According to Oslo II, Israel has the right to veto the employment of anyone
who is suspected of being a security threat.
<p>Analysts also think the PA is not complying with its quantitative limitations
on firearms. Oslo II raised the Cairo Agreement’s initial quantitative
restriction to 15,000 weapons, of which 8,000 would be in the West Bank
and 7,000 in Gaza. Yet, by one estimate, the PSS and the Palestinian population
as a whole own approximately 40,000 additional weapons than are allowed
by Oslo II.[12] In addition, the PSS has managed to develop small manufacturing
workshops for the production of hand grenades and other ammunition.[13]
These assertions have led observers to wonder as to the true <i>raison
d’etre</i> of the PSS: Is it designed simply to ensure public order in
the territories, or is it a rudimentary army under development, camouflaged
as a simple law enforcement body?
<p>Although PA representatives such as Palestinian Legislative Council
speaker Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), for example, insist that “the PSS is a police,
not an army,“[14] the figures enumerated above seem to indicate otherwise.[15]
The PA has become the most heavily policed territory in the world, with
an officer-to-resident ratio of 1:50; the U.S. ratio for police officers
and sheriff’s deputies, in contrast, is 1:400. Presumably, the difference
in these ratios exists not because corruption and crime rates are that
much higher in the PA. In fact, activities related to the preservation
of public order in the Palestinian cities and in the 25 police- stationed
villages commonly known as “Area B+“ (see Appendix III) involve only 25
percent of the actual PSS personnel. Although Oslo II instructed that all
the Palestinians recruited to the police forces had to be duly trained
to perform police functions (see Appendix III), the agreement never really
determined the nature and the quality of the training required for the
practice of law enforcement. The issue remained open for Palestinian interpretation
and the result was that, apart from the Civil Police, the main branches
of the PSS have never been properly trained in police work. Moreover, most
PSS employees lack the necessary equipment-such as shields, clubs, and
tear gas-needed for riot control and other equipment needed to perform
police duties. The reason for this is simple: Almost 75 percent of the
total force is not assigned to any law enforcement duties. Therefore, although
the PSS is commonly referred to as “Palestinian Police,“ three-fourths
of its officers are not technically police officers. Rather, they are assigned
duties relating to the important missions of regime preservation and preventive
action against the PA’s Islamist opposition, as well as the protection
of “Area A“ borders and cooperative work with the IDF under the definitions
of the Oslo Accords. With the PSS’s status as “more than a police force“
thus clearly defined, it is time to consider whether the PSS is developing
into a Palestinian army-to-be, and whether the Palestinians want it to
do so.
<p><b>Palestinian Attitudes Toward Militarization</b>
<p>The topic of national security has rarely been debated within the Palestinian
community, and therefore there is no agreed-upon definition of Palestinian
security needs.[16] The few Palestinian scholars who have written about
the issue are at odds with each other concerning the preferred means of
achieving security. Yazid Sayigh, for example, believes that only after
the Palestinians achieve sovereignty will they be able to achieve security.
He rejects the idea of establishing a massive Palestinian army, saying
that “for the Palestinians to seek a peace agreement permitting them to
maintain sizable armed forces would be self-defeating, since their resultant
defenses would in any case be inadequate to defeat an all-out attack.“[17]
He therefore advocates creating a single formation, such as a National
Guard, responsible for both border security and public law and order.[18]
Faisal al-Husayni, the PA’s minister for Jerusalem affairs, has conveyed
a similar idea, saying the PA should invest its money in schools and high
technology enterprises rather than in arms, because the PA’s army could
never be as strong as the IDF.[19] Contrary to Sayigh’s and al-Husayni’s
views, another school believes that the capacity for self-defense is an
essential component of the Palestinian national security doctrine and therefore
advocates the creation of a Palestinian army once a state is established.[20]
<p>It seems that the Palestinians have, for the time being, reluctantly
chosen the first model of a multipurpose security force—“reluctantly,“
because given the limitations of Oslo II and the PA’s existing economic
constraints, a multipurpose security force is the maximum they could achieve.
The PA is under permanent scrutiny, lacks the capacity to procure and manufacture
arms openly, and is economically dependent on international donors. Despite
these severe constraints, however, if the PA were interested in developing
the PSS into a rudimentary army-in-waiting, it could take some preliminary
steps during the interim period to prepare for a time when the security
forces cbe transformed into a proper military.
<p><b>Is the PSS Building a Military Infrastructure?</b>
<p>Militarism is one of the means to create a supportive atmosphere for
future conscription, legislation, and public participation in national
security efforts. The PA tends to emphasize values such as aggressive patriotism,
the use of force by jihad (holy war) and struggle, and the dependency of
the political system on the security apparatus. PA chairman Yasir Arafat
himself is always seen wearing military uniforms and surrounded by his
military aides-even in private moments, such as while praying in a mosque.
Full military ceremonies take place on his arrival in and departure from
Gaza, even if his trip is no more than a one-day deliberation in Cairo.
Daily street parades, military commemoration days, and the extreme proliferation
of different types and colors of uniforms are some of the elements of a
“uniform culture“ that has been forged in the territories.[21] The most
ominous sign of the domination of this culture is the infiltration of military
values into Palestinian youth movements such as scout groups and Shabiba,
the youth wing of Arafat’s Fatah organization. During the summer of 1998,
Fatah inaugurated in Gaza a series of military camps that trained young
Palestinians in martial arts, handling light weapons, and other military
drills. The training staff of these camps belonged to the Istkhabbarat
al-Askariyya, the military intelligence branch of the PSS, thus making
it likely that these camps had the PA’s approval.[22] Intensive militaristic
activity among youth movements and student bodies could create the base
for a future ultramilitant Palestinian society.
<p>Additionally, a PSS intent on militarization would have to lay a proper
infrastructure to ease the transformation from the existing paramilitary
structure into a fully mobilized army. Components of this infrastructure
would include an embryonic training-and-recruitment system; a well-defined
echelon of command; and rudimentary military-related industries for the
local manufacture of uniforms, ammunition, and small firearms. All of these
components can in fact be found to some extent in the PA. Yet, the PSS
seems to have severe problems with at least one crucial part of this infrastructure—it
lacks a cadre of commander-quality recruits currently serving as regular
officers, who could assume command over newly recruited platoons and companies
once the transformation to a standing army occurs. The German Army of the
1920s successfully implemented this “accordion-like “ mechanism when the
Versailles Treaty limited it to only 100,000 soldiers. The Germans introduced
a highly competitive selection process so not only the commanders but even
each of the privates would be qualified, once the monitoring regime was
over, to become a field commander.[23] The PA, on the other hand, has failed
to adopt this method, and the current selection of PSS recruits is undefined
and based largely on political affiliation and loyalty to the regime rather
than on intellectual and leadership qualities. The low wage the PA pays
officers—compensation has decreased by 50 percent over the last three years,
such that the current monthly salary is about $200 [24]—discourages young
Palestinian <i>elites</i> from joining the PSS and helping to develop a
command-quality cadre. One PSS colonel, Abu Salah, who runs the training
programs for new recruits, describes the profile of the generation that
grew up during the intifada and is now joining the PSS:
<blockquote>They did not go to school, they are illiterate, they smoke,
many of them forget about helping their parents, they spend money on immoral
things and they have no sense of responsibility. That is the raw material
that Israel left us with here.[25]</blockquote>

<p><br>The previously mentioned summer military camps marked a change of
the above trend. The students who were admitted to the camps were selected
according to their leadership qualities and their potential to become future
commanders.[26] Although too early to determine, this could be the first
indicator that the PSS has adopted an “accordion-like“ mechanism.
<p>If the PSS were intent on militarizing, it could also make overtures
to the 350,000 refugees living in Lebanon who could serve as a potential
reservoir of military power for a future Palestinian army. Once statehood
is attained, a Palestinian port or airfield in Gaza or the West Bank could
be a route for smuggling heavy weapons and additional troops from Lebanon’s
refugee camps. These camps, which have turned into lawless havens for terrorists,
criminals and arms-dealers, could also provide the PA with a crucial component
required for a military buildup: training grounds. Indeed, Lebanon is the
only place where Palestinian soldiers can develop skills in special weapons,
such as the launching of anti-tank and antiaircraft missiles. Such skills
would be necessary in a future confrontation with Israel. If it is intent
on militarizing the PSS, the PA would therefore have some strong incentives
to cultivate its relations with the Lebanese factions with the intention
of mobilizing them in the future. In fact, great efforts are being made
to settle the internal disputes between the PA and Fatah’s faction in Lebanon,
so that if the peace process breaks down and is replaced by total conflict,
the PLO fighters in Lebanon will be ready to join in. Arafat has pledged
to support the Palestinian dissident groups financially, and-according
to different sources-millions of dollars designated for humanitarian projects
in the West Bank and Gaza have been diverted to Lebanon to fulfill the
pledge.[27]
<p><b>A Hybrid</b>
<p>To summarize, the PSS is at this point more than a police force yet
less than a rudimentary army. In its present framework, it hardly resembles
a typical police force: Apart from the Civil Police, the main units of
the PSS have never been trained in police work, and they lack the necessary
equipment for riot control. On the other hand, some fundamental components
that ought to exist in any military establishment are also missing in the
PSS. Among them are a well-defined and organized officers’ corps; a general
staff apparatus; training of military formations comprising the intermediate
and high levels of command (battalions and regiments); and the infrastructure
of a professional corps such as armor, artillery, signal, and surgeon corps.
Despite some minor steps described above taken by the PA to promote the
formation of such an infrastructure, there is no evidence of the existence
of a plan to build a full-fledged army. The PSS can thus best be described
as a hybrid, too complex and overstaffed to be the police force required
for the size of the Palestinian population and yet too underdeveloped both
organizationally and militarily to be considered a rudimentary army.
<p><b>The Next Round</b>
<p>The array of tensions during the last couple of years caused by the
impasse in the peace process has occasionally led analysts to speculate
that Palestinians may carry out what they call the “military option.“[28]
Many statements made by Palestinian officials in the context of political
crises, such as the building of Jewish housing in the areas of Har Homa
and Ras el-Amud in eastern Jerusalem, were provocative and belligerent.[29]
References to the military option received new meaning after the September
1996 Hasmonean Tunnel riots. It was no longer necessarily the resumption
of the massive, civil uprising of the Palestinian intifada (uprising) but
rather a large-scale use of armed forces supported by the unarmed Palestinian
masses. The Palestinians’ “victory“ in the clashes made them believe that
armed confrontation, even if not very desirable, is a viable option for
which they should be prepared.
<p>The prevailing view in the Israeli security establishment is that if
the peace process reaches a standstill, violence and the use of force will
be certain.[30] When “war-gaming“ the next confrontation, some major trends
are visible, all of them recent developments stemming from the lessons
of September 1996.
<p>First, one can assume that a future confrontation between the Palestinian
Security Services (PSS) and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will originate
in the same areas of friction where the riots erupted in September 1996:
the outskirts of the Palestinian cities ( “Area A“), especially where IDF
and PSS checkpoints are in close proximity. The several hundred feet separating
the two sides would become a convenient ground for an exchange of fire.
Such was the case in the northern outskirts of Jenin, the northern outskirts
of Ramallah and the Arak checkpoint in its southern outskirts, and the
western entrance to the city of Tulkarem in the West Bank. In the Gaza
Strip, the problematic points are the main junctions that lead to the isolated
Jewish settlements: Netzarim junction, Kfar Darom junction and Morag junction.
Other potential friction would probably arise around the Jewish enclaves,
such as Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus and Rachel’s Tomb in Bethlehem. The most
problematic point would most likely be the Jewish settlement in Hebron;
this city was under complete Israeli control in September 1996. The new
situation resulting from the deployment of the PSS in most of the city’s
territory, because of the Hebron Accord, will make defense of the Jewish
enclaves in the city one of the IDF’s most challenging undertakings.
<p>The second trend is related to the Israeli introduction of heavy weapons
during the crisis. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and attack helicopters,
all put into action during the last clash, will have to deal next time
with a new array of Palestinian threats. The general assessment is that
the Palestinians are amassing stocks of light anti-armor weapons, rocket-propelled
grenades, anti-tank missiles, and SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles, all of
which are forbidden under the Oslo Accords.[31] Reports about such stockpiling
differ with respect to the types and quantities of the weapons, but the
Palestinian ability to launch anti-tank weapons is almost certain.[32]
The PSS has succeeded in accumulating weapons mainly by smuggling them
into the Palestinian Authority (PA) across the Dead Sea and into the West
Bank, or across the Mediterranean Sea into Gaza.[33] Another channel of
smuggling is from Egypt by means of secret underground tunnels that connect
Egypt to Rafah in the Gaza Strip; despite the IDF’s extensive efforts to
locate and destroy these tunnels, all of them dug underneath the Israeli
controlled borderline, the underground channels remain very active.[34]
The Palestinians have also acquired weapons through continuous efforts
to steal them by breaking into Israeli military installations. Some of
these efforts have been very fruitful, and dozens of anti-tank missiles,
as well as rifles and ammunition, were thus transferred into PA territory.
Efforts to acquire anti-aircraft shoulder-fired missiles were made public
in February 1997, when a former IDF scout was arrested for stealing a military
patrol vehicle loaded with weapons and ammunition. In the investigation
he admitted that the weapons were ordered by the PSS through a Palestinian
who served as a contact with the suspect.[35]
<p>Another precaution the Palestinians have taken against future IDF use
of tanks is by digging anti-tank tunnels and trap-holes under central roads
in the West Bank and Gaza. These holes can be filled with explosives to
block the advancing armored vehicles. News about explosives stolen from
quarries in Israel emphasizes the existence of such a technique.[36] PSS
efforts to upgrade its military performance by achieving anti-tank and
anti-aircraft abilities are not mere defensive measures against a future
contingency in which the IDF carries out Operation Field of Thorns (see
chapter 5) and reenters the Palestinian cities. Behind these new abilities
hides also a psychological statement emphasizing that the PA is not as
feeble an opponent as it may seem. Attacking and destroying a state-of-the-art
weapon system such as a Cobra helicopter or a Merkava III tank would give
an enormous boost to the Palestinians’ esprit de corps. In a future confrontation,
the picture of a burning Israeli tank on the outskirts of Nablus, for example,
would become a much-sought commodity in the world media, symbolizing the
brave Palestinian “David“ taking a stand against the Zionist “Goliath,“
similar to the image of the Chinese student standing in front of a tank
in Tiananmen Square.
<p>The PSS’s performance during the September riots, as discussed previously,
certainly raised the Palestinian officers’ self-esteem, especially because
of their ability to kill and wound a relatively high number of senior Israeli
commanders. The PSS would probably adopt a similar sniper-style mode of
operation to inflict even more casualties in a future confrontation. Indeed,
sniper units have become among the most prestigious postings in the PSS.
To recruit a large group of snipers, the PSS acquired considerable numbers
of telescopic sights for their M-16s and AK-47s.[37]
<p>Militarily, the PSS’s preparations for confrontation are reflected in
a distinct change in the mode of operation and methods of training. The
security bodies are adopting a more professional approach, through training
in the use of formations of teams and squads for defined missions like
gaining control of an area of land, holding down a post, and attacking
an IDF post or settlement.[38] But the preparations for the next round
are not restricted to the military level. The participation of the unarmed
civilian population in a future conflict is a key factor in Palestinian
preparation. The PA, for example, holds self-defense courses for civilians.
The training includes lessons in shooting, hand-to-hand combat, and ceremonial
drills.[39] The civil defense apparatus is constantly improving by conducting
a massive program of first aid courses for PA residents and preparing water
reservoirs and an alternative electricity supply. The health system undertook
a face lift of its own by renovating emergency rooms in major hospitals
to be able to handle large numbers of wounded people.[40]
<p>To achieve a strong result-that is, winning the international community’s
support in a future conflict with Israel-PA chairman Yasir Arafat will
probably try to create an image of a popular uprising supported by a marginal,
armed backup of the PSS. To coordinate the masses’ participation, the PA
will have to use its electronic media, namely Palestinian TV and the Voice
of Palestine radio station, in the same way they were utilized during the
1996 Tunnel riots. The frequent televised images of Palestinian casualties
and PSS officers exchanging fire with the IDF were used to incite the masses,
thus encouraging them to take active part in the insurgency.[41] This is
likely to recur in a future clash.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>Rarely in modern history has a nation, struggling for its independence,
been granted permission by its own military occupier to establish a quasimilitary
armed force and to handle its own security matters independently. The Arab-Israeli
conflict, known for creating some unique events in the past, provided such
a precedent in Oslo on September 13, 1993, when the government of Israel-by
signing a declaration of principles for negotiating peace with the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO)-thus agreed to the formation of an armed
Palestinian police force in the West Bank and Gaza (see Appendix I). The
decision aroused the fierce opposition of Israeli right-wing groups, which
chanted the slogan, “Don’t hand them guns!“ Many less-conservative individuals
similarly doubted the Palestinians’ ability to ensure the maintenance of
law and order during the interim negotiation period.
<p>Nearly five years after the deployment of the Palestinian Security Services
(PSS), its performance shows a lop-sided balance-sheet. On the positive
side, it seems that the efforts of the PSS to ensure and preserve Arafat’s
regime and to restrain the opposition movements have been successful. Arafat’s
regime is sound, much to the credit of the Preventive Security Force, the
Mukhabbarat (General Intelligence), and the Special Security Force. These
PSS units have suppressed some of the most radical factors in the opposition
and succeeded in minimizing the domesthreats to the present regime, enabling
it to proceed on the peace track. But this achievement has been eclipsed
by some negative developments that can be detected in the PSS and its relations
with the civilian population. The force that was established with the aim
of “protecting the public and its property and acting to provide the feeling
of security and safety“ (see Appendix II) is gradually becoming a public
menace. The low salaries of PSS officers and their high tolerance for human
rights violations have created a situation in which the involvement of
officers in illegal activities, corruption, and the abuse of power are
quite common. One should also include on the negative side of the balance
sheet the two major armed clashes in which the PSS were involved during
the turbulent interim period: Black Friday and the Tunnel Riots. Both were
seminal events that changed the identity and the strategic status of the
Palestinian Authority (PA). On Black Friday, the PSS broke the taboo of
firing live ammunition at civilians, thus adding the PA to the club of
human rights-violating regimes. In September 1996 the action of Palestinian
troops against the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) placed the PSS high on Israel’s
list of potential threats and adversaries, causing the IDF to revise its
military doctrine of low intensity conflict.
<p>The PSS has therefore become a key player in the Israeli-Palestinian
arena with a large role in a possible future Israeli-Palestinian confrontation.
Promises from PA officials that Palestinians “are not stupid enough to
think of war with Israel, and [that] a military confrontation is not even
a consideration for us,“[42] are overshadowed by internal instructions
circulated within the PSS urging commanders to “be ready and well-armed
with all weapons and means in anticipation of the worst possibilities.“[43]
These instructions show that, although the PA would prefer not to engage
itself in a military confrontation with Israel, the PSS has widely discussed
and prepared for such a development. The PSS’s basic assumption is that
if a major breakdown occurs, “the Israeli army will not come back “to the
cities; as one senior PSS officer said, “They [Israelis] know the Palestinians
will fight with their lives and many [Israelis] would die.“[44] This assessment
is probably correct, especially owing to the IDF’s sensitivity to urban
warfare, with its high casualty rate.[45] In a future confrontation, then,
the most likely lines of engagement between the IDF and PSS would be in
rural areas and on the outskirts of the main Palestinian cities, especially
around the checkpoints at city entrances. Such combat would hardly be decisive
and would probably lead to the development of a long war of attrition in
the territories in which tactics used by the IDF and Hizballah in southern
Lebanon would likely be adopted. The IDF might find itself facing threats
like roadside bombs, anti-tank missiles, and ambushes along the main transit
routes of the West Bank and Gaza. The PSS has studied the techniques used
by Hizballah in Lebanon and may want to apply some of the more useful ones
against the IDF, as the terrain in the West Bank is similar to that in
Lebanon. The “Lebanonization“ of the West Bank would be intolerable to
the Israeli government mainly because so many Israeli civilians are trapped
in the middle of this potential warzone. Regardless of the political implications
of a future confrontation with the PSS, on the military side alone the
PSS has the ability both to inflict upon the IDF a considerable number
of casualties and to deflate Israel’s national morale.
<p>The imminence of a confrontation between the IDF and the PSS will not
necessarily be determined by the proximity to May 4, 1999. The sensitivity
of the political situation supplies almost daily a new excuse for lighting
the powder keg. If, however, the five-year deadline for the final status
negotiations involves the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state
and, thus, the breakdown of the Oslo framework of negotiations, then Israel
might end up facing a different opponent than the one described in this
paper. Dissolving the Oslo Accords would mean that the various limitations
on the size, structure, and armaments of the PSS would cease to exist.
As a sovereign nation, the Palestinians would be able to legislate mandatory
conscription as one of the first steps in the buildup of a standing army.
The Palestinian population is one of the youngest in the world; 73 percent
of Palestinians in the territories are younger than 35 years old. Legislation
mandating conscription could thus immediately yield more than 100,000 new
recruits.[46]
<p>Indeed, the Palestinian Legislative Council has already proposed a National
Service Law, which would have drafted all high school graduates for one
year of work in Palestinian public projects, including the police. The
initiative was eventually withdrawn because of Israeli objections.[47]
Mandatory service legislation would likely also be economically lucrative.
Currently, the PSS employs only paid, professional officers, at an annual
cost of more than $500 million. Introducing mandatory service would enable
the new Palestinian state to draft a much less expensive-if not entirely
unpaid-pool of conscripts into the ranks of the PSS. The millions of dollars
once spent on police salaries could then be diverted toward procurement
and training to promote the strengthening of the forces.
<p>Whether the PA establishes such an army following a declaration of independence
depends on both intentions and means. Strong motivations for building up
a military force more competent than the current one do in fact exist.
This can be surmised from the militaristic nature of Palestinian society,
which tends to embrace the “uniform culture.“ Another sign of a strong
desire or intention to create a Palestinian army is the fact that the PA
has thus far seized every opportunity to adopt the indicators of nationhood,
including postage stamps, a flag, legislative bodies, courts, a stock market,
and even an Olympic committee. The most important national indicator would
be a formidable military force, and it is hard to believe that the Palestinians
would waive their right to such a force once a state is declared.
<p>Nevertheless, desires and intentions are not always sufficient. In terms
of the PA’s means to create an army, the situation is much more complex.
The PA currently lacks the funds required to finance the buildup of large
military formations. The annual budget for the PA’s present 30,000-strong
police force-including salaries, training, supplies and living expenses-is
approximately $500 million, according to various financial estimates. Given
that its gross domestic product in 1996 was a mere $3.3 billion, the PA
will not be able to maintain such a large force for very long unless it
receives generous financial assistance from the donor community. Yet, most
of the countries that have already pledged to assist the Palestinians have
tied their pledges to civilian development projects and are reluctant to
donate money for police purposes. The Johan Jorgan Holst Trust Fund, which
the World Bank established in 1994 to help finance the PA’s budget, has
exhausted almost all of its funds after transferring more than $260 million
to the PA in 1994-1996. As a result, the PA has been forced to carry most
of the economic burden of its security forces on its own. It is therefore
unlikely to make much progress in the area of increasing its forces until
it reaches economic independence. All of this will leave the Palestinians
in the near future with a quasimilitary force that is much smaller and
more feeble than they would like it to be, yet at the same time too big
and much more costly than they themselves can afford to finance. Moreover,
if the Palestinians unilaterally declare a state, some donor countries
may rescind the aid they currently have earmarked for the PSS, thus forcing
the Palestinians to fund their own military. Constrained by economic limitations,
the PA-or the newly declared Palestinian state-might try to look to sign
mutual defense treaties with otArab countries. Even if the Palestinians
fail to achieve such pacts, however, the PSS will still pose a fundamentally
new type of military challenge to Israel in the coming years.

of weapons systems for the destruction and deterrence of foriegn military
forces. It usually has an air force and a navy to defend the skies and
the shores of the country. Some of the weapons employed by the military
have highly destructive capabilities-much more so than police forces, which
employ only light weapons for law enforcement and riot control. Although
it is true that the PSS is advancing its weaponization, as will be seen
in future chapters, this chapter focuses primarily on the organizational
