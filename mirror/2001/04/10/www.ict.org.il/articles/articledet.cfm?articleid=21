<p><BR><B>Background</B>
<BR>Muhammad Hussein Mikdad, a Lebanese Shi'i, and accountant for Hizballah's
social welfare services in Lebanon, was chosen by the organization’s apparatus
for overseas security to become a maverick terrorist. On April 4 1996,
he took a Swissair flight from Zurich to Tel Aviv with bomb parts hidden
in a carry-on bag. He entered Israel on a forged British passport in the
name of Andrew Newman. Mikdad stayed several days in Tel Aviv, traveling
around the country in a rented car. This was the first time that Hizballah
succeeded in slipping one of its operative's into Israel through the international
borders.

<P>On April 9, Mikdad checked into the Lawrence Hotel in east Jerusalem,
where he was to assemble a bomb intended to explode in a public place in
Israel. Three days later on April 12, Mikdad blew off both his legs and
one arm when the bomb he was assembling in the east Jerusalem hotel room
accidentally detonated.

<P>Mikdad was trained for the preparation of the bomb at the Iranian embassy
in Beirut. The device was to utilize a highly-sophisticated explosive,
weighing less than one kilogram and meant to be packed into a Sony clock
radio. The explosive was to be detonated by an external switch attached
to a hollow rubber tube, which had replaced the radio's antenna. A senior
Israeli official said it was one of the most sophisticated attempts they
have encountered.

<P>During his interrogation, Mikdad said that he was one of seven Lebanese
Shi'ites trained simultaneously at Janta, the Lebanese Beqa` Valley. All
were chosen for their foreign-language skills and outward appearance, enabling
them to pass as Westerners. None of Mikdad's classmates has yet been accounted
for.

<P>The film,<B> Mikdad</B> chronicles Hussein Mikdad's journey from accountant
to terrorist. Mirroring the Security Services' investigation clue by clue,
this impeccably researched film gradually reveals a stunning network of
international terrorism - a network that extends beyond the Middle East
to Europe and the United States.

<P><B>Mikdad</B> is a 52-minute documentary by Producer/Director, Dan Seeton,
a SET Production in association with RAITRE Format/Italy and SPIEGEL-TV/Germany.
The film includes an exclusive interview with Hussein Mikdad and actual
footage of his interrogation.
