<p><p><img SRC="../graphics/afghan_veterans_w.gif" height=150 width=200 align=RIGHT>In
the summer of 1993, Professor Samuel Huntington, a lecturer in international
relations at Harvard University, published an article entitled “The Clash
of Civilizations,”[1] which caused a stir within the international academic
community. Three years later, Professor Huntington published a book of
the same name,[2] in which he argues that the root of global conflict at
the turn of the century is neither ideological nor economic, but primarily
cultural.
<p>Huntington divides the development of conflict in the modern world into
four periods:[3]
<ol>
<li>
<b>Conflicts between monarchs: </b>These conflicts were based on rival
economic and territorial interests.</li>

<li>
<b>Conflicts between nations:</b> Since the French Revolution and the rise
of nationalism, the principal actors in conflicts are no longer monarchs,
but nations. As Huntington puts it: “The wars of kings are over, the wars
of people had begun.”[4] This stage lasted until the end of the First World
War.</li>

<li>
<b>Conflicts between ideologies:</b> Since the rise of Communism in Russia,
conflicts between nations have been replaced by conflicts between competing
ideologies—first between Communism, fascism and democratic liberalism,
and later between Communism and democratic liberalism (‘The Cold War’ or
‘East against West’).</li>

<li>
<b>Conflicts between civilizations: </b>Since the end of the ‘Cold War,’
the clash between civilizations has become the primary cause of conflict.</li>
</ol>
Huntington argues that until the end of the ‘Cold War,’ Western culture
dominated the modern world, and shaped most of its significant conflicts,
which he calls ‘Western civil wars.’[5] At the end of the ‘Cold War’ era,
Huntington continues, Western culture lost its primacy, and the center
of gravity in international politics shifted toward non-Western cultures.
Conflicts between Western and non-Western cultures, and conflicts within
the non-Western cultures themselves began to replace the ‘Western civil
wars.’ From this point on, nations and states affiliated with non-Western
civilizations ceased being the victims of Western colonialism, but became
active, or even dominant, partners in the shaping of history.
<p>During the ‘Cold War’ period, nations were classified according to their
political, economic, and technological advancement (developed and developing
nations, First, Second, Third World Nations, etc.). Huntington claims that
this nomenclature is outdated and that today nations should be classified
in terms of culture or civilization. Civilization is defined by objective
factors such as: language, history, religion, customs, and institutions,
and subjective factors, such as the way people define themselves or their
reference group. Therefore, civilizations may be defined as the broadest
cultural entities with which people identify, or: “The highest cultural
grouping of people and broadest level of cultural identity people have,
short of that which distinguishes humans from others.”[6]
<p>Huntington goes on to list eight major civilizations in the modern world:
Western, Slavic, Sino-Confucian, Japanese, Hindu, Latin American, Islamic,
and African.[7] Of these, Huntington singles out Islamic civilization as
the most militant, and emphasizes the inherent conflict between it and
Western and other civilizations. He outlines the historical evolution of
this conflict, starting with the Crusades, and continuing through the Ottoman
Empire, Western colonialism, and the liberation wars of the Muslim states.
<p>A glance at the map of international conflicts corroborates Huntington’s
premise: From West Africa to the Pacific Islands, Islam is engaged in violent
conflicts with neighboring civilizations (known as ‘fault-line wars’).
Huntington adduces the following conflicts in support of his theory:
<ul>
<li>
The Afghan War,</li>

<li>
The Gulf War,</li>

<li>
The conflict between Serbs and Albanians,[8]</li>

<li>
The confrontation between Turkey and Greece,</li>

<li>
Ethnic and religious confrontation in the former USSR,[9]</li>

<li>
The war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.</li>
</ul>
A more up-to-date list (up to 2000) lends further support to Huntington’s
contention:
<ul>
<li>
The civil war between Christians and Muslim in the Sudan,</li>

<li>
The war between Christian Ethiopia and Muslim Eritrea,</li>

<li>
The war in Kosovo between the Christian Serbs and Muslim Albanians,</li>

<li>
The war in Chechnya and Daghestan, and insurrection against the pro-Russian
regimes in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan,</li>

<li>
The ongoing conflict with Iraq,</li>

<li>
The war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir,</li>

<li>
Subversion by Uighur Muslim nationalists in Western China,</li>

<li>
The struggle between the Muslims and the Christian regime in the Philippines
for control of Mindanao (Moro),</li>

<li>
The war between Indonesian Muslims and Christians in East Timor,</li>

<li>
The Israeli-Arab conflict—a significant element in the conflict between
Islamic and Western cultures, which has over the past decade adopted the
guise of a Jewish-Muslim conflict.</li>
</ul>
Although the political reality, as described above, reinforces Huntington’s
basic contention, a critique of some of his claims is in order. Our main
criticism is that Huntington depicts all Muslim states as a single cultural
bloc in conflict with Western and other civilizations. A more careful study
of the regimes in Muslim states shows that the majority are secular regimes,
or moderate and pragmatic Muslim regimes which, far from being in conflict
with Western culture, have jumped on to the ‘modernization bandwagon,’
and adopted Western technologies, values, and ways of life. As well as
modeling themselves on a Western life-style, many even rely on military,
political, and economic aid from the West for their survival. Huntington
has failed to differentiate between this dominant stream, and the fundamentalist
Islamic stream, which despite its militant anti-Western stance, still represents
only a minority within the Muslim world.
<p>The Muslim world today is torn by a deep internal conflict over the
essence and purpose of Islamic society. The outcome of this internal conflict
has dictated, and continues to dictate, the nature of the ties between
Muslim civilization and Western and other civilizations.
<p>The radical Islamic elements operate in all Muslim states at different
levels of intensity. Their objective is threefold: to bring about the rule
of Islamic law in Muslim countries, to establish new Islamic states, and
to obtain independence for Muslim minorities in countries such as China,
the Philippines, Serbia, and India, among others.
<p>In other words, the radical Islamic struggle against foreign cultures
may embrace one or several of the following four goals:
<ol>
<li>
The overthrow of secular regimes in Muslim states and their replacement
by Islamic theocratic regimes.</li>

<li>
Independence for Muslim minorities, and the establishment of independent
Islamic states.</li>

<li>
The suppression of ethnic/cultural minorities seeking autonomy or independence
in Muslim states.</li>

<li>
The neutralization of the influence of foreign—particularly Western—civilizations
situated on the fault lines with Islamic culture.</li>
</ol>
The above fits in with Islam’s basic tenet that the world is divided into
two parts which are in perpetual conflict—the world of Islam (<i>Dar al-Islam</i>)
and the world of heresy (<i>Dar al-Harb</i>). Within this conception, Islam’s
mission is to bring the true faith to the whole of mankind. In pursuance
of this goal, Islamic radicals and fundamentalists (Islamists) resort to
a variety of tactics, from education, propaganda, economic aid and spiritual
guidance, to political subversion, terror and war. An analysis of the foci
of conflict shows that the Islamists’ primary concern is to reshape the
political reality within the Muslim world.
<p>Islamic fundamentalism is funneled through dozens of Islamist organizations
that operate throughout the Muslim world. In addition, there are three
states—Iran, Afghanistan, and the Sudan—whose fundamentalist Islamic regimes
provide spiritual and material succor to the radical Islamic movements.
These states work independently and through the radical Islamic movements
to export the Islamic revolution to the entire Muslim world, and spearhead
the struggle against foreign—particularly Western—civilizations.
<p>The following three events have had a significant impact on the development
of Islamic fundamentalism:
<ol>
<li>
<i>The Islamic revolution in Iran.</i> This event turned Iran into a focus
of radical Shiite Islam, exported the revolution to the Muslim world, and
led to radical Islam’s condemnation of the hegemony of the superpowers
under the slogan: ‘Neither East nor West.’</li>

<li>
<i>The victory of the Islamic mujahideen in Afghanistan.</i> The defeat
of the Soviet Union in battle was perceived by Islamic circles not only
as a military victory, but also as a cultural one.[10] It created a broad
cadre of seasoned, militant volunteers eager to disseminate fundamentalist
Islamic ideas throughout the Muslim world.</li>

<li>
<i>The disintegration of the USSR.</i> The collapse of Communism left a
political and ideological vacuum into which Islamic circles were only too
eager to step.</li>
</ol>
With the demise of Communism and radical Socialism—which had formed the
ideological basis of a number of secular regimes in Muslim countries—an
ideological vacuum was created which Islamic radicals have tried to fill,
so far with partial success. The collapse of the Soviet Empire also led
to the creation of new states with Muslim populations, thereby furnishing
a new arena of conflict for fundamentalist Islamic circles. Radical Islamic
circles perceived the new geopolitical reality of the post-Cold War era,
in which Islam spearheaded the ideological conflict with the West, as a
mark of their success.
<p>In Europe, meanwhile, for the first time in decades, the issue of Muslim
identity arose among the populations of the Balkans (Bosnia, Kosovo, and
Albania). For the first time, too, the religious and ethnic conflicts in
this region presented radical Islam with an opportunity for gaining an
ideological foothold in these areas.
<p>In this article we shall be focusing on a recent phenomenon which clearly
exemplifies Huntington’s theory of the ‘clash of civilization’—that of
the ‘Afghan mujahideen’—the spearhead of radical Islam’s struggle against
heretical cultures. Despite their name, the ‘Afghan terrorists’ are not
affiliated with a specific movement or state, but see themselves as the
representatives of Islam’s relentless struggle against secular Muslim regimes
and heretical cultures.
<p><b>The ‘Afghan Alumni’</b>
<p>Throughout the eighties, Muslim volunteers from Muslim and Arab countries
streamed into Afghanistan to help the Afghan mujahideen in their struggle
against the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul and the Soviet occupying forces.
Although no exact figures are available, it would seem that several thousand
answered the call of the Afghan jihad, for religious, personal, or mercenary
reasons.[11] During their stay in Afghanistan, the volunteers underwent
military training and acquired extensive combat experience in guerrilla
warfare.
<p>The mujahideen and the Afghan volunteers were usually trained in camps
in Pakistan, particularly in the city of Peshawar (near the Afghan border),
which soon became the hub of mujahideen activity.[12] Instruction was given
by Pakistanis, experts from Arab countries, and for a while also by Western—particularly
official American—specialists.[13] The volunteers from Arab countries also
trained in camps in the Sudan, Yemen, and Iran.
<p>Although there are no records of the breakdown of volunteers by their
affiliation to any of the Afghan rebel groups, many of the volunteers (some
say as many as 3,500) would seem to have joined ‘<i>Hizb Islam</i>,’ Hekmatyar’s
extremist organization (where some of the volunteers continue to serve
to this day, participating in its struggle against the current Islamic
regime in Kabul.[14]) After the collapse of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul
in May 1992, most of the volunteers—or ‘Afghan Alumni’—began returning
home.
<p>Despite the Pakistani government’s declaration of January 1993[15] pledging
to shut down the offices of the Afghan movements and expel illegal residents,
in practice it has failed to keep its promise. To this day, many mujahideen
continue to live in the camps of Peshawar and other places in Pakistan.
<p>The ranks of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ were swollen by the hundreds of Islamic
terrorists who came to Afghanistan after the war to train in guerrilla
and terrorist warfare, under the sponsorship of the various mujahideen
factions. One of the outstanding leaders of these ‘Afghan Alumni’ is Ahmad
Shauqi al-Islambuli, the brother of President Sadat’s assassin. Al-Islambuli
and other radical leaders do not see themselves as terrorists, but rather
as the proponents of a jihad designed to overthrow the ‘corrupt’ regimes
of Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, and other Arab or Muslim countries.[16]
<p>The Afghan Alumni’s heroic participation in the jihad, their extensive
combat experience, and their victory over the Soviet superpower, have today
turned them into the vanguard of the Islamic fundamentalist and radical
terrorist organizations.
<p>Today, the ‘Afghan Alumni’ operate in four capacities:
<ol>
<li>
As leaders of the radical Islamic organizations in their countries of origin
(Egypt, the Maghrib countries, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc.)</li>

<li>
As founders of new terrorist organizations, such as Osama bin Laden’s ‘<i>Al-
Qa’idah</i>’ [‘The Vanguard’].</li>

<li>
As the architects of ‘independent’ terrorist cells which, while lacking
a specific organizational affiliation, cooperate with other institutionalized
terrorist organizations.</li>

<li>
As participants in the struggles of Islamic populations in places such
as Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Tajikistan, and Kashmir.[17]</li>
</ol>
Many of the countries which welcomed the volunteers’ departure for Afghanistan,
violently opposed their return, fearing that these battle-hardened, Muslim
firebrands would join the ranks of the radical Islamic opposition in their
countries of origin. Accordingly, the authorities of Egypt, Jordan, and
most countries of the Maghrib tried to prevent the volunteers from returning,
with varying degrees of success.
<p>Afghanistan, Sudan, and even the Yemen are today the Afghans’ main sponsors,
sheltering them before they infiltrate back into their countries of origin
to join the ranks of the fundamentalist terrorist organizations there.[18]
Iran, despite religious and ideological differences with the Taliban regime,
shelters leaders of organizations affiliated with the ‘Afghan Alumni.’
It supports several groups associated with the ‘Afghan Alumni’ in Lebanon,
Egypt and Algiers and even sanctions the passage of activists and weapons
through Iran to the mujahideen fighting in Chechnya. The above notwithstanding,
Iran is cautious about forming ties with the ‘Afghan Alumni,’ and its relations
with Afghanistan are strained.
<p>Below is a breakdown of ‘Afghan Alumni’ by country of origin.
<p><b>Algeria</b>
<p>During the 80s, many volunteers—an estimated several hundred to three
thousand—left Algeria to fight alongside the Afghan mujahideen.[19] The
Algerian mujahideen in Afghanistan (and Pakistan) were, and still are,
divided between the supporters of the radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)
and the supporters of Mahfoud Nahnah’s more moderate Algerian ‘<i>Hamas</i>’
movement. In the late ‘80s, particularly after the mujahideen’s victory
in Afghanistan, the battle-hardened volunteers, imbued with an Islamic
revolutionary fervor, began returning home, where they joined radical Islamic
organizations such as ‘The Armed Islamic Movement’ (GIA) and the ‘<i>Al-Takfir-wal-Hijrah</i>’
organization.[20]
<p>Ali Belhaj, a leader of the Islamic Front, served as the spiritual father
of most of the radical opposition organizations in Algeria. Some believe
it was he who paved the way for the Afghan groups’ absorption into the
Islamic Front, with the aim of institutionalizing a focus of militant radical
power as a counterweight to the political compromise advocated by some
of the movement’s leaders.[21]
<p>The Afghans’ first attack took place in November 1991 in the town of
Gumhar on the Algerian-Tunisian border, when a group of fighters attacked
a police station, causing many deaths and injuries.[22] From this point
on, the struggle between the Algerian regime and the Islamic opposition
intensified, with growing reports of involvement by the ‘Afghans’ in terrorist
operations throughout the country.
<p>The terrorist activities ofthe Islamic organizations in Algeria, which
began in 1991 with sporadic attacks against military and governmental personalities
and institutions, have gradually escalated into a relentless civil war
that has, so far, claimed at least 70,000 lives. In under a decade, the
Islamic terrorists have succeeded in gaining control of many rural areas,
and even some urban neighborhoods.
<p>In 1994, the Islamic terrorists expanded their struggle by targeting
foreign civilians and institutions in Algeria. Algeria currently has about
60,000 foreign workers, many of them working for the oil industry, which
is the country’s main source of revenue.[23]
<p>From 1994 on, particularly in 1995-1996, the GIA began carrying out
terrorist attacks abroad. All the attacks took place in France, or targeted
French citizens abroad, to protest the French government’s support of the
Algerian regime. According to GIA spokesmen, the GIA’s hostility toward
France is a relic of the historical conflict between Algeria and France
during the Algerian War of Independence in the early ‘60s. Terrorist attacks
by the GIA abroad included the hijacking of an Air France plane in December
‘94, and two waves of attacks in France (July-Oct. 1995 and December 1996)
in which about twenty people were killed, and dozens were injured.
<p>The GIA, like other fundamentalist organizations in Arab countries,
advocates the establishment of an Islamic regime ruled by Islamic law.
Interestingly, although it sees the USA, Israel, and Judaism as the enemies
of Islam, none of its terrorist attacks have been specifically directed
against American or Israeli targets. However, as part of its overall anti-French
strategy, three of its attacks were directed against Jewish targets in
France. The first (24 December 1994) was an abortive car bomb attack against
a Lyon synagogue, the second was a car bomb attack against a Jewish school
in Villeurbanne near Lyon (September 1995), and the third was a letter
bomb sent to the editor of a Jewish newspaper (December 1996).
<p>The GIA terrorist attacks in France led to the exposure of an extensive
GIA infrastructure in various European countries, particularly in France,
Belgium, the U.K., Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Spain. Logistic, financial
and operational ties were found to exist between the members of the small
terrorist cells operating in these countries. The main objective of this
European network was to smuggle funds and weapons to their comrades in
Algeria.[24]
<p>The European-wide crackdown against terrorists, sponsored by France,
dealt a heavy blow to the infrastructure of the Algerian terrorist network,
and effectively led to the cessation of terrorist attacks by GIA operatives
abroad.
<p>Unlike Palestinian and Shiite terrorist organizations, the GIA has so
far refrained from carrying out ‘extortionist’ terrorist operations in
attempts to free dozens of its members languishing in various European
jails. This may be due to the GIA’s wish to focus on the struggle at home,
and to avoid alienating European public opinion, which could harm its potential
for exploiting Europe as a vital logistic base for its activities in Algeria.
<p>Note that in 1998, too, more GIA-affiliated terrorist cells were uncovered
in Europe. The involvement of first- and second-generation immigrants from
the Maghrib countries in attacks in France, and in Algerian terrorist cells
in various countries in Europe, shows that the organization disposed of
a large pool of potential volunteers from the poorer strata of the immigrant
population who felt discriminated against and alienated in their countries
of adoption. These populations served as a source of recruitment for new
volunteers, some of whom were sent to Afghanistan for terrorist training
in the early ‘90s and others of whom volunteered to fight in Bosnia.
<p><b>Tunisia </b>[25]
<p>Tunisian intelligence agents claim that in May 1992, Islamic extremists
who had trained in Afghanistan tried to assassinate the president of Tunisia,
Ben Ali, by attempting to down his plane with a portable missile. The attempt
failed and the assassins were arrested. Today, the Tunisian security services
are successful in containing extremist Islamic activity in Tunisia. Extremist
Islamic organizations have been banned and most of their leaders have been
arrested or have fled abroad, including Rashid Ghannushi, head of the ‘<i>Al-Nahdha</i>’
[‘Revival’] movement, who has been granted political asylum in London.
<p>Nevertheless, the violent struggle between the Algerian regime and the
Islamic opposition in neighboring Algeria, and the possible rise to power
of an extremist Islamic movement there, will undoubtedly have far-reaching
repercussions on developments in Tunisia.
<p><b>The Yemen</b>
<p>The Yemen, today, is an important center of ‘Afghan’ terrorist activity,
due to the regime’s ‘tolerant’ attitude toward such activity. The Yemen
also serves as a meeting and transit point for ‘Afghan Alumni’ throughout
the world.
<p>In December 1998, the Yemenite authorities arrested members of an extremist
Islamic group who were planning to carry out attacks against British and
American targets in Aden.[26] The group, headed by the London-based Muslim
cleric Abu Hamza, who is identified with the radical ‘Supporters of Shari’a’
movement, included eight Britons and two Algerians. Members of the group
reached the Yemen using forged French passports, and were trained and equipped
by a local fundamentalist Islamic organization called ‘The Islamic Army
of Aden,’ led by Al-Mihdar, who was executed after his implication in the
kidnapping of 16 European tourists.[27]
<p>During Al-Mihdar’s trail, it transpired that members of the ‘Islamic
Army’ kidnapped the European tourists in order to obtain the release of
members who were arrested in December 1998.[28] The kidnapping saga was
brought to an end by a rescue operation mounted by the Yemenite security
forces, resulting in the death of the kidnappers and four hostages. A study
of those involved in the two terrorist attacks in the Yemen shows that
some of them were trained in Afghanistan, and had ties with the Egyptian
‘Jihad’ organization supported by bin Laden.
<p><b>Egypt</b>
<p>In the 1980s, Egypt aligned itself with the Muslim and Western world
by condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and by providing aid
to the mujahideen leading the struggle against the Kabul government and
Soviet forces. In a show of solidarity, Egypt allowed volunteers to leave
for Afghanistan to participate in the mujahideen’s struggle. Most of the
Egyptian volunteers who left for Afghanistan were members of the Muslim
Brotherhood or of more radical organizations, such as the Egyptian ‘Muslim
Jihad.’[29] At the time, the Egyptian authorities were relieved that the
‘revolutionary fervor’ of the radical Islamic elements was being directed
outside Egypt. This not only led to a decline in radical activity in Egypt
but also strengthened Egypt’s status within the Muslim community.
<p>However, as we shall see, the issue of the ‘Afghan volunteers’ became
in time a ‘double-edged sword’ for the Egyptian government. With the defeat
of the Soviet forces and the collapse of the pro-Soviet administration
in Kabul, the Egyptian volunteers began returning home, much to the dismay
of the Egyptian authorities who, fearing an upsurge in radical terrorist
activity in Egypt, did their best to prevent them.
<p>Despite their efforts, some ‘Afghan Alumni’ evidently found their way
back into Egypt where they joined Islamic terrorist organizations. In 1992-1994,
the ‘Afghans’ were involved in a series of terrorist attacks in Egypt.
Their trials, which came to be known as ‘the Trials of the Afghanistan
Returnees,’ shed light on some of their activities as members of terrorist
organizations working against the Egyptian regime.
<p>Below are some of the ‘achievements’ of the Egyptian mujahideen in Afghanistan:
<ul>
<li>
The establishment of training camps in Afghanistan and in Peshawar in Pakistan.[30]</li>

<li>
The dispatch of trained fighters back to Egypt, particularly via the Sudan.[31]</li>

<li>
The preparation of false documents for these fighters.[32]</li>

<li>
The cultivation of drugs and drug trafficking in order to finance the organizations’
activities.[33]</li>

<li>
Propagandaactivity for terrorist organizations such as ‘<i>Tala’i’ al-Fath</i>’
[‘Vanguards of the Conquest’] and the Egyptian ‘Jihad.’[34]</li>

<li>
The planning and implementation of attacks in Egypt and other places (‘Afghan
Alumni’ were among the perpetrators of the World Trade Center bombing in
New York City).[35]</li>
</ul>
The Egyptian volunteers were involved in numerous terrorist activities
in Egypt, among them violent activities in Upper Egypt. In 1992-1993, extremist
Islamic activists incriminated in these activities were arrested and tried
in Egypt. During their interrogation, they admitted that they had trained
in Afghanistan, and that they had planned terrorist attacks against the
Egyptian security forces and Egyptian public figures,[36] such as the attempted
assassination, in 1992-1993, of the Egyptian information minister, Sawfat
al-Sharif, the Interior Minister,[37] and the prime minister, Atef Sidky.
The assailants, who were caught, were found to be members of ‘<i>Tala’i’
al-Fath</i>’—an organization that had been set up in Afghanistan.[38]
<p>The Egyptian terrorist organizations chose tourism as their target,
as the best way of harming the state’s economy (tourism is the country’s
second most important source of revenue after the Suez Canal), and its
image both at home and abroad. The spectacular terrorist attacks they mounted
against tourists were designed to destabilize the regime on the one hand,
and to attract new recruits, on the other. Attacking tourists also served
the ideological goal of destroying the representatives of the ‘heretical’
Western culture that ‘contaminated’ the Muslim world.
<p>As a result of these attacks, the 1992-1993 tourist seasons in Egypt
suffered serious losses amounting to several billion dollars. The most
serious attack was that perpetrated by ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’
[‘The Islamic Group’] against tourists in the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut
in Luxor (November 1997), in which 58 tourists and four Egyptians were
killed. The attack caused enormous damage to Egypt’s recovering economy,
in losses estimated at half a billion dollars.
<p>The Coptic Christian minority, perceived by the fundamentalist organizations
in Egypt as a cultural, ethnic, and religious foreign implant, and envied
for its economic success, has also served as a target for terrorist attacks.
<p>In November 1993, president Rabbani of Afghanistan visited Egypt and
signed an extradition agreement and a security cooperation pact, whereby
Egypt offered Afghanistan economic and security aid in return for Afghanistan’s
commitment to banning extremist Egyptian Islamic elements in Afghanistan
and extraditing prominent activists such as Muhammad Shauqi al-Islambuli.[39]
At the end of his visit, President Rabbani expressed his appreciation of
Egypt’s contribution to the victory of the Afghan mujahideen, condemned
terrorism in all its forms, and declared that he would not allow Afghanistan
to be used as a springboard for attacks against the regime in Egypt.[40]
<p>Rabbani’s wish to improve his country’s standing with Egypt was not
shared by his rival Hekmatyar, who extended his patronage to the Egyptian
fundamentalists in Afghanistan, and even offered Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman
political asylum (after Egypt requested his extradition from the USA for
his involvement in the World Trade Center bombing). Since Rabbani’s regime
had no control over Hekmatyar’s opposition movement,[41] Afghanistan failed
to keep its promise to banish or extradite Egyptian fundamentalist terrorists
residing in the country.[42] Consequently, Egypt announced that it could
not honor the agreement. Today, with most of Afghanistan in the hands of
the Taliban, whose regime is not recognized by the Egyptian government,
the agreement has lost any validity.

<P><p>The ‘heavy-handed’ policy adopted by the security forces against the
terrorist organizations in Egypt, and the expulsion of terrorists, limited
their freedom of action, forcing them to resort to terrorist attacks abroad.
Most of these attacks were in retaliation for the arrest, extradition,
and assassination of their members abroad by Egyptian security forces,
sometimes in cooperation with local security forces. These attacks included
the attempted assassination of an Egyptian diplomat in Switzerland by the
Egyptian ‘Jihad’ (November 1995), a suicide bomb attack against the police
station in Rijeka, Croatia, by ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>,’ (October
1995), and the bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan (November 1995).
The most daring attack orchestrated by ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’
was the attempted assassination of Hosni Mubarak during his visit to Ethiopia
(June 1995). (The terrorists chose this occasion on the assumption that
security precaution there would be more lax than in Egypt.)
<p>The Egyptian organizations, predominantly ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>,’
were indirectly involved in international terror, through ‘Arab-Afghans’
(Egyptian citizens who trained in the Mujahideen camps after the end of
the war) who operated as individuals within autonomous Islamic terrorist
cells abroad.
<p>Note that the blind Egyptian cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the supreme
spiritual authority of ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’ and the Egyptian
‘Jihad,’ issued a <i>fatwa</i> [religious decree] sanctioning the activities
of these terrorist cells.
<p>In recent years, especially since 1998, the activities of the Egyptian
organizations have been influenced by their ties with Osama bin Laden and
his ‘<i>Al</i>-<i>Qa’idah</i>’ organization. ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ has recruited
a substantial number of Egyptians. At least one of the drivers in the suicide
bomb attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam in August 1998 masterminded by
‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ was an Egyptian citizen. The alliance between bin Laden
and the Egyptian organizations is reflected in his close ties with leaders
of these organizations, such as Ahmad Rifa’i Taha and Mustafa Hamza, heads
of the political and military arms of ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’
respectively, and especially Oman Ayman Zawahiri, head of one of the factions
of the Egyptian ‘Jihad.’ Zawahiri has adopted bin Laden’s new terrorist
strategy of targeting American, rather than Egyptian objectives, on the
grounds that the head-on confrontation with the Egyptian regime has caused
the death of innocent people and has alienated Muslim public opinion in
Egypt, while attacks against the American infidels were sure to elicit
sympathy among the Muslims. That the Egyptian ‘Jihad’ adopted this strategy
is evident in its planned attack of the US consulate in Albania, (foiled
in June 1989), and its involvement in the embassy attacks in East Africa
in August 1998.
<p>‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>,’ the mainspring of the religious-military
coalition envisaged by bin Laden, has for the past two years been divided
in its policy regarding domestic and anti-US terrorism. The unilateral
declaration of a truce toward the Egyptian government by its imprisoned
leaders (July 1997) caused a rift between the leadership in Egypt and the
leadership abroad concerning the movement’s policy and goals. The massacre
of the tourists in Luxor (October 1997) intensified the polemic, in particular
as a result of growing pressure by the Egyptian regime on members of the
organization in Egypt and abroad. Omar Abdel Rahman’s declaration from
his prison in the U.S. advocating peaceful means in pursuing the organization’s
objectives (October 1998), tilted the balance in favor of the ‘moderates.’
<p>‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’ has already officially declared a
‘ceasefire,’ and some members of the Egyptian ‘Jihad,’ after Ayman Zawahiri’s
resignation, have followed suit. This declaration has intensified the polemic
within the Egyptian organization, and the question of whether the ceasefire
will be observed remains to be seen.
<p><b>The Jordanian Afghans </b>[43]
<p>In early 1994, a series of bombs exploded in several cinemas in Jordan.
Following arrests by the Jordanian security forces in 1995, a group belonging
to the ‘<i>Bai’at al-Imam</i>’ [‘Homage to the Imam’] movement was discovered,
headed by ‘Issam Muhammad Al-Burqawi (Abu Muhammad al-Muqadassi), a Palestinian
originally from Jaffa, and a number of ‘Afghan Alumni.’[44] The organization,
which disposed of weapons anexplosives, aimed at overthrowing the corrupt
regime in Jordan through a jihad, as part of an overall struggle to reform
Islamic society. In the course of the investigation, it transpired that
the terrorists had intended carrying out a range of terrorist attacks against
people (public figures) or institutions (cinemas, hotels) they identified
with corruption.
<p>In December 1999, an Islamic terrorist organization, comprising Jordanian,
Iraqi, Algerian and Palestinian citizens bearing American documents, was
uncovered in Jordan. The group was headed by Abu Hoshar who had already
been arrested in Jordan (1993) for carrying out attacks there, but who
had been granted a royal pardon. Abu Hoshar, who had trained in Afghanistan,
returned to Jordan to set up ‘The Army of Muhammad’ which was also partly
composed of ‘Afghan Alumni.’[45]
<p>On 17 December 1999, Halil Dik (an American of Palestinian origin),
considered the architect of the abortive attacks in Jordan, was extradited
to Jordan by Pakistan. The investigation of members of the organization
showed that they intended carrying out attacks against Jewish and Israeli
tourists in Amman’s “Radison” Hotel, against visitors to Moses’ tomb on
Mt. Nebo, against tourists passing through the Jordanian-Israeli border
checkpost, and against pilgrims visiting the site of Jesus’ baptism.[46]
<p><b>Attacks by ‘Afghan Alumni’ against Israeli and Jewish targets</b>
<p>The virulent rhetoric of the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, used
by the Sunni Muslims against Judaism and Israel has not, so far, been translated
into a consistent terror campaign against international Jewish and Israeli
targets. Since the mid-90s, however, Sunni Muslim organizations have been
responsible for isolated attacks/attempted attacks against Israeli and
Jewish targets abroad. For example, on 19 April 1996, during the ‘Grapes
of Wrath’ operation in Lebanon, the Egyptian ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’
mounted an attack against tourists in the ‘Europa’ hotel in Cairo, killing
17 Greek pilgrims. In its communiqu&eacute; claiming responsibility for
the attack, the organization stated that it had meant to target Israeli
tourists who are known to frequent the ‘Europa’ hotel.
<p>As stated above (see section on Algeria), the Algerian GIA carried out
three attacks against Jewish targets in France as part of its terror campaign
in France. These attacks included two car bomb attacks, one near a synagogue
in Lyon in 1994 (foiled) and one near a Jewish school in Villeurbanne.
It was only because the school bell was late that a massacre of Jewish
schoolchildren was averted. The third attack was a letter bomb sent to
the editor of a Jewish newspaper in France (1996).
<p>Bin Laden’s ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ organization, the most extreme in its
condemnation of Israel’s role in the ‘crusade’ against Islam, has not,
so far, directly attacked Israeli or Jewish targets abroad.
<p>The above notwithstanding, ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ was indirectly involved
in planning attacks against these targets via other terrorist organizations.
According to the testimony of one of its senior activists tried in Egypt
in April 1999 during the ‘Albanian Returnees Affair,’ Ayman Zawahiri’s
Egyptian ‘Jihad,’ which is part of bin Laden’s terrorist network, planned
to carry out attacks against Israeli targets throughout the world.[47]
<p>In 1995 and 1999, two organizations of ‘Afghan Alumni’ which were planning
attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets were discovered in Jordan (see
section on Jordan above).
<p>Particularly noteworthy is the growing involvement of Palestinian ‘Afghan
Alumni’ abroad in planning terrorist activities against Israeli targets.
This has been particularly evident in recent terrorist activity in Jordan.
<p>In February 2000, Sa’ad Hindawi, a Palestinian ‘Afghan veteran’ hailing
from Halhul, who lived in Lebanon for many years, was arrested in Israel,
where he and his family had returned after the establishment of the Palestinian
Authority. Hindawi, whose brother is Chief of Police in Hebron, admitted
that in 1998 he was trained in Durante—one of Osama bin Laden’s camps in
Afghanistan—in terrorist warfare and sabotage. Diagrams for assembling
explosives were found in his possession. Despite his denials, he was suspected
of planning to carry out attacks against Israel, possibly in coordination
with local Palestinians.[48]
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that Sheikh Abdullah Azzam, a Jordanian
of Palestinian origin, was the main ideologue of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ and
bin Laden’s partner in setting up the ‘Services Office’ (‘<i>Maktab al-Khidamat’</i>)—the
recruiting office for the thousands of Islamic volunteers who streamed
into Afghanistan to take part in the battle against the Soviets. Although
Abdullah Azzam was killed in a car bomb explosion in Afghanistan in 1989,
his writings and philosophy continue to provide ideological fodder for
the struggle against the ‘enemies of Islam.’
<p>A number of factors may explain the relatively small number of terrorist
attacks by Sunni terrorist organizations against Israeli and Jewish targets
abroad:
<ul>
<li>
These organizations see their main goal as the overthrow of the secular
regimes in their own countries, and their replacement by Islamic regimes
governed by the rule of Islamic law (<i>Shari’a</i>).</li>

<li>
These organizations do not see attacks against Israeli or Jewish targets
as a means in itself, but rather as part of an overall terrorist strategy
against their non-Muslim rivals.</li>

<li>
These organizations tend to focus their terrorist activity against American
objectives, in line with their view of the USA as Islam’s main enemy.</li>
</ul>
Osama bin Laden, a proponent of this policy, has been sharply criticized
for ignoring other ‘Islamic’ problems, including the Palestinian problem.
This criticism may have been one of the reason behind the choice of Israeli
and Jewish targets in the attacks perpetrated by the Egyptian ‘Jihad,’
‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>,’ and the Islamic cells in Jordan, in 1995 and 1999.
<p><b>Azerbaijan </b>[49]
<p>Following the defeats suffered by the Azeri (Muslim) forces in their
war with the Armenians (Christians) over control of the Nagorny Karabakh
region, Azerbaijan turned to Afghanistan in August 1993 for military aid.
Afghanistan responded by sending 1,000 mujahideen warriors to help the
Azeris. In October 1993, the Afghan mujahideen launched a surprise attack
against the Armenian forces in the region of Zanglan (near the Iranian
border), and even gained ground, before being repulsed by the Armenian
forces. As far as we know, these mujahideen forces remained in Azerbaijan
where they continue to help the Azeris in their struggle against the Armenians.
<p><b>Chechnya </b>[50]
<p>The disintegration of the Soviet Union triggered a religious-national
awakening in Chechnya, following which (6 September 1991) the leaders of
the separatist stream declared their secession from the USSR and the establishment
of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.
<p>President Yeltsin, refusing to condone this move, tried to bring about
the downfall of the separatists by funneling aid to the opposition groups
in Chechnya, and by direct military intervention. His failure created a
situation of de facto independence for Chechnya, and led to growing tension
between the countries. This tension reached a peak on 11 December 1994,
when Russia invaded Chechnya. Since then, Russia and the Chechen separatists
have been engaged in an armed confrontation which began as a regular war,
but which has since evolved into guerrilla warfare and the use of terror
by the Chechen forces.
<p>Following the victory of the mujahideen in Afghanistan over Najibullah’s
pro-Soviet regime in 1992, the ‘Afghan Alumni’ were free to help the Islamic
struggle in various countries throughout the world, including Chechnya.
Afghan mujahideen organizations, and since 1994 the Taliban regime, have
been sending equipment, weapons, and warriors to help the Muslim separatists
in Chechnya in their struggle against the Russians. Other Muslim organizations
helping the Chechens are affiliated with the Saudi Wahabi Movement, and
even bin Laden’s organization. Moreover, the ranks of the Chechen fighters
have been swollen by ‘Afghan Alumni’ headed by Ibn-ul-Khattab, whose extensive
combat and leadership skill, acquired in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, have
proved of great service to the Chechens.
<p>The ‘Afghan’ volunteers’ extensive experience in guerrilla warfare and
terror and their familiarity with Russian tactics and vulnerabilities acquired
in the wars against the Russians in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, have been
of invaluable assistance to the Chechen warriors.
<p><b>Bosnia </b>[51]
<p>In 1993, about 200 Arab-Afghan mujahideen from Algeria, Sudan, and Saudi
Arabia were found to be operating in central and northern Bosnia..
<p>These mujahideen as well as taking an active part in the war against
the Serbian forces, ran educational activities designed to inculcate their
fundamentalist worldview on the Bosnian population. In an interview with
a member of the mujahideen, he stated that his movement had two goals in
Bosnia: to launch a jihad against the Serbs, and to educate Bosnian Muslims
in the true way of Islam (‘missionary’ activity or <i><font size=+0>da</font>’wah</i>).
<p><b>Independent terrorist cells</b>
<p>One of the salient features of international terrorism in recent years
has been the activity of autonomous, Islamic terrorist cells without any
defined structural hierarchy, which operate through institutionalized terrorist
organizations. The ‘Afghan Alumni’ played a major role in the activity
of these cells, through their training in Afghanistan and their ties with
Islamic Relief Organizations, which supplied them with logistic and financial
aid. These terrorist cells were responsible, inter alia, for the World
Trade Center bombing in New York City (February 1993) which left six dead
and about a thousand wounded, plots to attack the UN building and the New
York-New Jersey interstate tunnels (June 1993), the attack against the
Philippine P.A.L. jet liner (December 1994) and a planned offensive against
American planes in Asia, scheduled for early 1995.
<p>An investigation of these terrorist cells brought to light their ties
with Islamic Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) such as the ‘Muslim World
League’ (M.W.L.), the ‘International Islamic Relief Organization’ (I.I.R.O.),
and Islamic cultural centers in Europe, such as the center in Milan. Members
of these cells were also found to have close ties with Osama bin Laden.
<p><b>‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ [The Vanguard]</b>
<p>Another key organization in the activity of the ‘Afghan Alumni,’ whose
influence has been increasing in the international arena, is ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>,’
an organization set up in 1988 by the Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden.
<p>‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ was set up by the ‘Services Office’ (<i>Maktabal-Khidamat</i>),
a Non-Governmental Islamic Relief Organization, to handle the recruitment,
absorption, and placement of thousands of Islamic volunteers from 50 countries
around the world in mujahideen camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
<p>After the war, most of its activities were conducted from the Sudan
and Afghanistan through a network of world-wide offices, including the
USA (especially the ‘Al-Kifah’ Center in Brooklyn) and the Philippines.
<p>‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ provided aid to other terrorist organizations, and
worked for the radicalization of the Islamic movements operating in Chechnya,
Bosnia, Tajikistan, Somalia, Kashmir, Yemen, and Kosovo. Its members were
also involved in terrorist operations, such as the attacks against UN forces
in Somalia in October 1993, in which 18 American servicemen were killed,
and the attacks in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. There is also evidence
pointing to a clear connection between ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ and terrorist
attacks that were planned and carried out by terrorist cells led by Ramzi
Yousef in New York (1993) and in the Philippines (1994). ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’
was likewise involved in the attack in Riyadh, in which six people, including
five American servicemen, were killed (November 1995). The Saudis argued
that bin Laden was not directly involved in the last two attacks, but that
his militant anti-American rhetoric may have provided the inspiration for
them.
<p><b>The escalation of the confrontation between bin Laden and the USA</b>
<p>In 1998, the issue of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ became something of a <i>cause
c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> after the spectacular attacks carried out by
‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ in East Africa. Bin Laden, accused by the US of masterminding
these attacks, was portrayed by the Western and Arab media as epitomizing
the threat of international fundamentalist terror. Bin Laden lent credence
to this claim by setting himself up as the leader of the “historical cultural-religious
struggle between Islam and the Jewish-Crusader pact’ which, he claimed,
aimed at subjugating Islam and conquering the Muslim holy places.[52]
<p>In interviews and statements, such as the June ‘96 ‘Declaration of War’[53]
and the February 1998 ‘<i>fatwa</i>,’<i> </i>bin Laden paints a world view
in which the entire world, especially the Middle East, is seen as the stage
on which the deterministic battle for survival of the three major religions
is being waged. In this struggle, a Jewish-Christian (or ‘Jewish-Crusader’)
alliance has evolved, personified by the USA and Israel (and World Jewry),
which has conquered the holy Islamic places (Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem),
and aims to subdue Islam. According to bin Laden, this alliance is responsible
for the systematic and deliberate slaughter of Muslims. As an example,
he brings the massacre of the Muslim Iraqi population by the American forces
during the 1991 Gulf War, the bombing of Iraq in December 1998, the Sabra
and Shatila massacre and the killing of Palestinians in the territories
by the Israeli forces, among others.[54]
<p>In order to win over the Muslim public, bin Laden sprinkles his rhetoric
with historically loaded terms imbued with Islamic undertones, such as
‘Crusaders’ and ‘Jihad.’ He justifies the violence he preaches on the grounds
that its purpose is to protect the Islamic holy places. By portraying the
Muslim as victim, he attenuates his role as aggressor.
<p>Bin Laden believes that the use of violence and terror will show the
community of believers that the enemies of Islam, even if seemingly invincible
(like the USA and the Soviet Union), are in fact rendered vulnerable by
their lack of faith. In this context, bin Laden relies heavily on the ethos
of the victory of the Afghan mujahideen which, he holds, brought about
the collapse of the Soviet Empire. He cites other examples of the weakness
of the enemy (particularly the USA), such as the withdrawal of American
troops from Somalia which, he claimed, was the result of the guerrilla
activities he supported. The attacks by the Saudi opposition forces in
Riyadh (November 1995) and Dhahran (June 1996), which left twenty-four
dead and dozens injured, were part of a two-pronged struggle: to ‘purge’
the holy places (Mecca and Medina) of American control, and to bring about
a moral-psychological victory for the Islamic warriors. Bin Laden had similar
designs on the Israeli occupiers of the holy site of Al-Aqsa.[55]
<p>During 1998, bin Laden has spun around him a web of Islamist organizations
to counteract the Jewish-Crusader pact. On 23 February 1998, he convened
the heads of a number of Islamic organizations in Afghanistan, and declared
the establishment of ‘The Islamic Front for the Struggle against the Jews
and the Crusaders’ (hereafter the ‘Front’). The ‘Front’ issued a <i>fatwa</i>
signed by the leaders of five major Islamic organizations—Osama bin Laden,
head of ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’, Ayman al-Zawahiri, head of the Egyptian ‘Jihad,’
Ahmad Rifa’i Taha, leader of the Egyptian ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>,’
Sheikh Miyar Hamza, Secretary of the Pakistan Scholars Society (‘<i>Jama’at
al-’Ulema’)</i> and Fazlul Rahman, the emir of the Bangladesh Jihad Movement.
Since bin Laden has no religious authority or military power to speak of,
he needs the backing and support of these organizations. The clerics, particularly
Sheikh Miyar Hamza, a high-ranking Islamic spiritual authority, lend a
religious character to the decisions of The Islamic Front, while the heads
of ‘<i>Al-Gama’ah al-Islamiyyah</i>’ and the Egyptian ‘Jihad’ provide the
military-terrorist infrastructure.
<p>A <i>fatwa</i> issued by ‘The Front’ called on Muslims throughout the
world to consider it their personal duty to kill Americans and their allies,
including civilians, in order to liberate the HolMosque in Mecca (read:
Saudi Arabia) and the Al-Aqsa Mosque (read: Jerusalem and Palestine).[56]
<p>In May 1998, in an interview with the ABC network, bin Laden declared
before the American public, the Front’s intention to carry out global attacks
against American citizens in retaliation for the American administration’s
‘corrupt policy.’ Trilateral security cooperation between the USA, Egypt
and Albania foiled the attack planned by members of the Egyptian ‘Jihad/Zawahiri
faction’ against the US embassy in Tirana, and led to the extradition of
its members to Egypt (July 1998). Following these events, the ‘Front’ and
the Egyptian ‘Jihad’ sent letters to the <i>Al-Hayat</i> newspaper[57]
threatening to attack American targets. The next day (7 August), members
of ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ launched two sensational attacks against the US
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, resulting in 291 dead, and about 5,000
injured. Most of the victims were local people. Of the US citizens who
were the main target of the attack, only twelve were killed (Nairobi embassy
employees).
<p>The attacks in East Africa presented the USA with an opportunity for
carrying out a limited military operation against the ‘Afghan Alumni’ under
the leadership of bin Laden and the Egyptian organizations. The evidence
taken from those involved in the embassy attacks served to vindicate the
US bombing of ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ bases in Afghanistan and the Sudan, and
the violation of the sovereignty of the sponsor-states involved. The American
bombing (20 August 1998) was directed against five ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’
camps in Afghanistan, and against a pharmaceuticals concern in Khartoum
which, according to the USA, was financed by bin Laden, and manufactured
chemical war components for him.
<p>Alongside military and intelligence operations, the USA and Britain
also explored the diplomatic avenue. The USA, for example, sent Ambassador
Richardson to Afghanistan in an attempt to persuade the Taliban to hand
over bin Laden or at the very least, to contain his anti-American activity
and rhetoric. Britain for its part, was prepared to strike a deal with
the Taliban, by authorizing the opening of a Taliban office in London,
and clamping down on the Afghan opposition in London, in return for a restriction
on bin Laden’s activities.[58]
<p>So far, despite promises by senior figures in the Taliban regime to
contain bin Laden, no attempts have been made to suppress him or extradite
him. On the contrary, interviews by bin Laden to the Arab and Western media
in late 1998, in which he threatens to step up attacks against the USA
and its allies, testify to the limited effectiveness of diplomatic measures
of this kind.
<p>Meanwhile, the USA continued to cooperate with its Arab and European
partners in rounding up members of ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ and the Egyptian
organizations, with some success. September 1998 saw the arrest of a number
of key operatives in bin Laden’s terrorist network, such as Wahdi Al-Haj,
a Lebanese Christian who converted to Islam. Al-Haj, who until 1994 had
served as bin Laden’s personal secretary in the Sudan, was instrumental
in laying the groundwork for the August 1998 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
He was arrested in Texas, where he had moved in 1997, probably with the
intention of setting up a terrorist infrastructure in the USA.
<p>On 16 September, Mamduh Muhammad Mahmud Salim, one of bin Laden’s senior
aides, was arrested in Munich. Salim, who served as bin Laden’s financial
and logistics advisor, was responsible for procuring weapons (possibly
even non-conventional weapons). Salim was extradited to the USA on 24 December
1998, where he is awaiting trial for participation in bin Laden’s terrorist
network.
<p>Members of bin Laden’s network have been arrested in London. Foremost
of these is Khaled Fuaz, bin Laden’s representative in London, a member
of the Saudi opposition, and head of the ‘Advice and Reform’ commission.
The USA has requested his extradition, and is awaiting Britain’s decision.
<p>Egypt too, during the second half of 1998, stepped up its counter-terrorist
operations against Egyptian operatives abroad. In a joint American-brokered
security operation, Egypt arranged for countries such as Albania, Azerbaijan,
Bulgaria, South Africa, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, to extradite
members of the Egyptian ‘Jihad’ and bin Laden’s terrorist network. This
operation, later known as the ‘Albanian Returnees Affair,’ almost destroyed
the Islamic umbrella organization.
<p>Bin Laden used the American bombing of Iraq (17-20 December 1998) as
a pretext to once again threaten American citizens for supporting the US
massacre of the Iraqi Muslim population. In a series of aggressive interviews
with ‘Time,’ ‘Newsweek,’ and the BBC, he called on his Muslim brothers
to renew their attacks against the enemies of Islam.[59]
<p>Despite the blows he has sustained in recent months, Osama bin Laden’s
strike capability has not been significantly impaired. Bin Laden’s choice
of response is contingent on developments between the USA and ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>.’
He may even decide to expand ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ to include, as well as
his Egyptian allies, organizations such as the Indian ‘<i>Harakat al-Ansar</i>,’
or the Philippine ‘<i>Abu Sayyaf</i>.’
<p>Bin Laden has proclaimed his intention to intensify efforts to obtain
non-conventional weapons. He sees this as a religious duty, and accuses
Muslims who obstruct such activity as sinning against Islam. Bin Laden
is deliberately vague about whether he possesses such weapons, and under
what circumstances he would use them.[60]
<p>Bin Laden’s attempts to acquire and manufacture non-conventional weapons
have been closely monitored by the USA even before he openly declared his
intentions. Indeed, the US justified its attack on the pharmaceuticals
plant in Khartoum on the grounds that the factory was manufacturing chemical
weapon components for bin Laden. The extradition of Mamduh Salim (24 December),
bin Laden’s weapons procurer, from Germany to the USA, was also in connection
with the acquisition of non-conventional weapons.
<p>On 5 October 1999, members of the Taliban Olympics Organization protested
the International Olympics Committee’s decision to ban Afghan athletes
from taking part in the Olympic Games other than in an individual capacity.
Members of the Taliban Athletics Authority accused the USA of putting pressure
on the Olympics Committee to prevent the Afghan athletes from taking part
in the games, because of the Taliban’s refusal to extradite bin Laden.
In early October, the IOC announced that it no longer recognized the Afghan
Olympics Committee.
<p>The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, justified Afghanistan’s reluctance
to extradite bin Laden on the grounds that the US had failed to produce
incontrovertible proof of his involvement in terrorist attacks. “Since
he is a Muslim and a guest in our country, and we are forbidden to cast
out a guest, or worse, deliver him to the enemy,” says Omar, “even if half
of Afghanistan were destroyed, we would not hand him over.”
<p>The sanctions placed by the UN on Afghanistan in October 1999 automatically
went into effect in November of that year. These sanctions included a ban
on international air traffic and the freezing of Taliban assets in banks
throughout the world. Since, however, the Taliban have very few assets
in world banks, the latter sanction has not proved very effective. The
ban on international flights is more effective, since Afghanistan is dependent
on the Afghan airline Ariana for importing medicines and food products.
However, since Afghanistan traditionally engages in ‘under-the-table’ transactions,
even this sanction is not particularly effective, and its importance is
mainly declarative.
<p><b>Conclusions</b>
<p>The phenomenon of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ has in recent years became an
increasingly significant factor in the world of international terror and
poses a real threat to the stability of Muslim regimes. It far transcends
the narrow context of a terrorist organization or state-sponsored terrorism.
Rather, it represents a militant religious-ideological current, which aims
at bringing about a cultural revolution in an attempt to reinstate Islam’s
bygone glory. As such, the phenomenonof the ‘Afghans’ clearly embodies
the clash of civilizations that lies at the root of Huntington’s premise.
<p>The Afghan war gave rise to a number of exceptional processes in modern
history, as described below:
<ul>
<li>
The creation of a kind of Islamic ‘internationale’ through the recruitment
of volunteers throughout the Muslim world to help the struggle of the Afghan
mujahideen.</li>

<li>
The creation of a global network of radical Muslim terrorists through ties
between these volunteers and radical Islamic movements throughout the Muslim
world.</li>

<li>
The creation of a mystique of invincibility. The Islamic fighters’ victory
over the Soviet forces, has won them international acclaim and has served
as a source of inspiration to Islamists throughout the Muslim world.</li>

<li>
The creation of a broad-based cadre of highly motivated and experienced
warriors, bent on exporting the Islamic revolution to the world at large.</li>
</ul>
Osama bin Laden is one of the outstanding ‘products’ of the Afghan war,
and his organization ‘<i>Al-Qa’idah</i>’ is one of the main expressions
of the ‘Afghan’ phenomenon. Bin Laden views his struggle as part of the
conflict between Islamic and other civilizations, particularly ‘the Jewish-Crusader
Civilization,’ as he calls it.
<p>As a cultural struggle, the world-wide Afghan struggle is being waged
on three fronts: within Muslim countries (to reinstate the rule of <i>Shari’a</i>
law); in countries with Muslim minorities, situated on ‘fault lines’ with
other cultures (the Balkans, the Caucasus, Kashmir, etc.); and, internationally,
in the struggle against Western, particularly US, civilization, which is
perceived by the fundamentalists as the source of all evil, and the primary
threat to Islam.
<p>It looks as if the clash of civilizations as perceived by Huntington,
at one extreme, and Osama bin Laden, at the other, is with us to stay,
at least for the foreseeable future.
<p><b>Recommendations</b>
<p>The phenomenon of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ poses a series of challenges to
Muslim countries, countries in conflict with Muslim minorities, and Western
states alike.
<p>The first problem is intelligence-related. The widespread distribution
of the ‘Afghan Alumni and the lack of an institutionalized and centralized
system makes it difficult to penetrate their ranks and foil their activities.
This makes international intelligence cooperation between potential victims
of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ even more imperative. The purpose of such cooperation
is to create a database and monitor the movements of Afghan activists throughout
the world.
<p>Preventive action also requires international cooperation, on two levels:
<p><b><i>A. At the level of the terrorists</i></b>
<ol>
<li>
Prioritization of the ‘Afghan Alumni’ issue within the world’s intelligence
community and the allocation of special resources to further develop its
intelligence potential.</li>

<li>
Bilateral or multilateral agreements on international cooperation on intelligence
issues; special projects specifically designed to counter the Afghan threat.</li>

<li>
Selective strikes against Afghan terrorists (aerial attacks such as those
carried out by the USA in response to the attacks against the American
embassies in Africa, or operations by Special Forces).</li>

<li>
Stanching the flow of funds to the terrorist organizations and affiliated
NGOs.</li>

<li>
An information and propaganda campaign directed at Muslim communities in
West European countries and in Muslim countries, pointing out the danger
the Afghan terrorists represent for Islam by violating the humanitarian
values advocated by Islam.</li>
</ol>
<b><i>B. At the level of the sponsor states</i></b>
<ol>
<li>
The introduction of effective political and economic sanctions by the international
community against countries helping Afghan terrorists.</li>

<li>
Where necessary, the introduction of military sanctions, in order to destroy
support for the activity of Afghan operatives.</li>

<li>
A concerted and comprehensive effort to prevent charitable institutions
and NGOs channeling funds to the Islamic terrorist cells, through the enforcement
of income tax laws, customs regulations, and banking restrictions.</li>
</ol>
In conclusion, we would emphasize that given the complexity and scope of
the problem, <i>only</i> effective and broad-based international cooperation
can achieve any significant results in the war against Afghan terror.
<p>Finally, prevention is better than cure. Due to the escalation potential
of Afghan terror, every effort must be made to solve the problem before
it develops into a more serious strategic risk through the use of non-conventional
weapons. It is up to the international community to do all within its power
to prevent the Afghan terrorists acquiring such weapons, before it is too
late.
