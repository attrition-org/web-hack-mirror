London-Based Islamic Group Issues Fatwa against Israel</h2></center>
As violence flared between Yasser Arafat's Fatah activists and Israeli
troops, the London based al-Muhajiroun group issued a <i>fatwa</i> (religious
edict) calling for Jihad against Israel. The Fatwa was published on the
group's website and sent out by email.
<p>The <i>fatwa</i> calls on Muslims all over the world to attack Israeli
interests. "this Fatwa is a call to fight against Israeli forces, their
government, Israeli Embassies, military airports and jets etc...as they
are legitimate targets for Muslims wherever they may be," reads the <i>fatwa,
</i>adding
"The Israeli cancer in Palestine must be uprooted. Islam obliges us to
liberate all Muslim land from occupiers whoever they may be whether American,
Jewish Israeli or other forces."
<p>"We must act now and rise against the presence of Israelis in Muslim
countries and close down their illegitimate embassies and companies." The
document concludes, "The Jihad against the Jews occupying Palestine will
continue until they withdraw completely from the whole of Palestine."
<p><i>The following is the text of a fatwa (religious edict) published
and disseminated by e-mail by the AL-MUHAJIROUN, a radical Islamist organization
based in Great Britain.</i>

<center><b>JIHAD FATWA AGAINST ISRAEL</b>
<br><b>CASE NO. ISRAEL/M/F50</b>
<br><b>DATE: 2ND OCTOBER 2000</b></center>

<p>O' Muslims, the naked aggression and atrocities committed against the
people of Palestine, such as killing them, desecrating the Mosque of Al-Aqsa
and throwing them out of their land and homes is a violation of the sanctity
of Human Beings and their honour which requires an immediate and comprehensive
solution including putting the perpetrators of these crimes on trial. The
Islamic Decree regarding the occupation of Palestine by the Jews is Jihad
for the sake of Allah (swt) and the divine evidence for this from the Qur'an
is that Allah (swt) says: "If anyone commits aggression against you retaliate
against them in equal manner" [EMQ 2:194].&nbsp;
<p>And this is compulsory upon the nearest Muslims to them and a burden
upon Muslims worldwide to support and help.&nbsp;
<p>O' Muslims, this Fatwa is a call to fight against Israeli forces, their
government, Israeli Embassies, military airports and jets etc...as they
are legitimate targets for Muslims wherever they may be. The divine evidence
for this from the Qur'an is that Allah (swt) says: "And kill them wherever
you meet them and turn them out from where they have turned you out" [EMQ
2: 191].&nbsp;
<p>However, it is prohibited to target any non-military or innocent Jews
because this would be considered to be murder and therefore aggression
against the sanctity of Human life. The divine evidence for this from the
Qur'an is that Allah (swt) says: "Fight for the sake of God those who fight
you and do not do transgression for Allah loves not the transgressors"
[EMQ 2:190]&nbsp;
<p>The Muslims in Palestine have appealed for help therefore it is an obligation
upon Muslims worldwide to respond and help verbally, physically, financially
or militarily. The divine evidence for this from the Qur'an is that Allah
(swt) says: "If they seek your support you must support them " [EMQ 8:72].
And for Allah (swt) saying: "And spend for the cause of Allah (i.e. Jihad)
and do not contribute to your destruction by your miserliness" [EMQ 2:195]&nbsp;
<p>And "Why must you not fight for the sake of Allah and of those who,
being weak, are ill treated and oppressed, men, women and children whose
cry is: our Lord rescue us from those people who are oppressors and raise
for us from thee one who will protect, and raise for us from thee one who
will help" [EMQ 4:75]&nbsp;
<p>There is no prohibition to be kind to those who do not fight against
you rather it is prohibited to be kind to those who fight you. The divine
evidence for this from the Qur'an is that Allah (swt) says: "God only forbids
you with regard to those who fight you for your faith and drive you out
of your homes and support others in driving you out from turning to them
for friendship and protection or to be kind to them and whoever does so
indeed they are the oppressors (i.e. Sinners)" [EMQ 60:9]&nbsp;
<p>The above divine evidences are a clear and a decisive verdict for the
atrocities, which have been taking place in Palestine over the last fifty-three
years. Therefore Muslims are obliged to fight against their enemies and
to help each other. In addition the Islamic verdict regarding Prime Minister
Barak and his commanders is for them to be put on trial in any independent
Islamic court for their crimes and for capital punishment to be applied.
Allah (SWT) says: "This is a declaration to the people so that they may
be warned"
<p>All praise is for Allah (swt) who alone we obey, worship, follow and
to whom we submit, ask forgiveness and depend upon. And Allah (swt) says:
"Indeed Allah has traded with the believers their lives and wealth in return
for paradise if they fight for the cause of Allah whether they are martyred
or victorious and this is a promise from Allah which he has made a duty
upon himself clearly recorded in the Torah, the Bible and the Qur'an. And
who is more faithful in his promise than Allah; so enjoy this good news
for your allegiance and loyalty to your Lord for this is the greatest achievement."
[EMQ 9:111]&nbsp;
<p>Conclusion:
<p>The Jihad against the Jews occupying Palestine will continue until they
withdraw completely from the whole of Palestine including the Golan Heights
and the Gaza Strip because any aggression against any Muslim property or
land by any Kuffar or non-Muslim forces whether American, British or the
Jews of Israeli makes Jihad (i.e. fighting) against them an obligation
upon all Muslims.&nbsp;
<p>To ally or to seek assistance of non-Muslim states is prohibited, a
sin and a grave crime not to mention a betrayal of Allah (swt), His Messenger
and all the believers. Hence whosoever among you allows his country to
become a base for American, Jewish or other kufr forces or conspires and
makes Muslim land a passage for any non-Muslim forces whether it be via
sea, land or air, assisting directly or indirectly, an attack against Muslims
in any part of the world will be at war with Allah (swt) and His Messenger.
He will be humiliating himself before Allah (swt) and before the whole
Ummah who will never forgive this ugly crime even if the perpetrator erects
barriers to hide behind.&nbsp;
<p>Any agreements and summits between the enemies of Islam whether G7,
G8, the UN or with so-called Muslim representatives such as the PLO or
Arabs of the Middle East in order to give away even a hand-span of Muslim
land or to oppress and fight the Islamic movements or to arrest their members
or to hand them over to the enemy in response to the Jews of Israel is
considered to be war against Allah and his Messenger Muhammad (saw).
<p>The Israeli cancer in Palestine must be uprooted. Islam obliges us to
liberate all Muslim land from occupiers whoever they may be whether American,
Jewish Israeli or other forces.&nbsp;
<p>The Fatwa is therefore JIHAD against the Jewish occupiers, their government,
army, interests, airports and institutions and it has been given by the
most prominent scholars of Islam today because of the occupation of Muslim
land and aggression against the Muslims of Palestine. The only Islamic
Fatwa against this explicit aggression is Jihad.&nbsp;
<p>Therefore the message for the Jews occupying Palestine is to leave and
return to where they came from or face a full scale war of Jihad which
will be the responsibly and the duty of every Muslim around the world to
participate in.&nbsp;
<p>O Mujahideen, O Muslim Armies and Activists wherever you are. Hold firm
to the book of Allah and depend on none but him, fight the enemy of Islam
and Muslims for the sake of none but Him and aim your weapons at the occupiers
forces.&nbsp;
<p>Let us salute Muslims in Palestine for their brave and generous stand.
May Allah support you with patience, victory, dignity and the power to
liberate the WHOLE of Palestine and to establish the Khilafah.
<p>O Muslim Armies, We Muslims must not be attached to life nor run from
death. Life's pleasures will come to us inevitably because God has granted
us all the treasures of the world; we have oil, gold, water, resources,
land, people, history and more importantly we have the Qur'an and we are
the grand-children of an Ummah (Islamic Nation) which was the superpower
for over a thousand years.
<p>We must return back to our roots, support Muslims wherever they are,
verbally, financially and militarily before the enemy enslave us and humiliate
us more. This matter a very dangerous one for it requires us to sacrifice
life, wealth and blood for its sake. Remember that the dignity of a Nation
cannot be measured with land or wealth because the dignity of a Nation
is not goods to trade with, therefore we must stand and engage in Jihad
and support the Mujahideen, for death is better than humiliation before
the disbelievers.
<p>O Muslims, the opportunity is here and we must not pass it by. The battle
is tense and our Muslim brothers are firm in their Jihad so we must not
lose time aimlessly. We must act now and rise against the presence of Israelis
in Muslim countries and close down their illegitimate embassies and companies.
Verily, the Ummah is our Ummah, their war is our war, their enemy is our
enemy, the Mujahideen are our brothers, their victory or defeat is our
victory or defeat and the Khilafah is our Khilafah.
<p>O Muslim Armies, Mujahideen, Scholars and activists, the Book of our
Lord calls us, The Ummah cries for us and Paradise awaits us, Let us fight
the Jewish occupiers, for a new dawn is near at hand.

<p>A week after this fatwa was published a document entitled "Advice &amp;

Al-Muhajiroun's offices in London. The text of this document is reproduced

<td>Press Release Dated 17th October 2000
<center>
<p>&nbsp;ADVICE -&amp;- WARNING TO ALL JEWS -&amp;- MUSLIMS IN THE UK</center>

<p>Following the stabbing of a Jew in Stamford Hill we issue this press
release as a warning to all Jews and Muslims in the UK and elsewhere so
that they can be aware of the consequences of the conflict taking place
in Palestine under the occupation of&nbsp; Israeli Jews and of the consequences
of the hostilities and&nbsp; aggression for Israeli interests and aggressors
world-wide.
<p>We would like to make it abundantly clear that it is an Islamic obligation
upon Muslims everywhere to support the Jihad against those who fight Muslims
anywhere in the world or who occupy Muslim land and that this support must
be financial, physical, military or verbal. However Muslims must be disciplined
and ensure that they do not target any civilians or any person who are
not a legitimate target according to the Shari'ah. Hence we hereby publicly
condemn the stabbing of the Jew in North London as a violation of the Shari'ah
and call upon all Jews to distance themselves completely from the atrocities
being committed by the fascist Israeli regime against Muslims in Palestine.
We urge Jews in the UK and elsewhere not to show any support for the Israeli
regime whether verbal, financial or physical or they may allow themselves
to become targets for Muslims everywhere.
<p>The Qur'an is explicit in making Israeli aggressors and occupiers legitimate
targets for Muslims wherever they may be. The divine evidence for this
from the Qur'an is that Allah (swt) says:&nbsp; "And kill them wherever
you meet them and turn them out from where they have turned you out" [EMQ
2: 191] and " If anyone commits aggression against you retaliate against
them in equal manner" [EMQ 2:194] and "Fight for the sake of God those
who fight you and do not do transgression for Allah loves not the transgressors"
[EMQ 2:190]
<p>Muslims in the UK must also be vigilant in ensuring that they do not
fall into the trap of supporting Yassar Arafat and the nationalistic call
for an independent Palestine of 13% of what was occupied in 1967 since
this is an affront to Islam, rather we must struggle for the liberation
of all Muslim land occupied since 1948! Arafat is an oppressor no better
than Mubarak and Fahad as one who has violated the Shari'ah, who does not
call for the Islamic solution, who does not therefore stand for the interests
of Muslims and who has alliances with those at war with Islam and Muslims
which is prohibited in Islam. In addition Muslims in the UK must distance
themselves from those who go with their begging bowls to Blair to ask for
his help when it is the British themselves who are killing us in Iraq,
it is the British who support Israel, it is they who gave Palestine away
in the first place under the Balfour Declaration and it is they who spearheaded
the destruction of the Islamic state!!!
<p>In response to the killing of a Jew in North London Sheikh Omar Bakri
Muhammad, the Principal Judge of The Shari'ah Court of The UK said: `I
warn and advise the Jewish community in the UK to distance themselves from
the state of Israel. Muslims are not after the Jewish nations and communities
around the world although Muslims are obliged to target those who are aggressors
or occupiers regardless of their religion or colour, whether they be Russian
forces in Chechnya, Hindu forces in kashmir or Jewish forces in Palestine
or indeed in any part of the world.
<p>Therefore if you support Israel financially, verbally or physically
you will become part of the conflict.'
<p>Sheikh Omar added in a talk delivered in Derby yesterday: `I call upon
Muslim around the world to march towards their government buildings, parliament
and presidential palaces, to occupy them and to depose their leaders as
a step forward and to take charge and send the Muslim armies to fight the
aggressors and occupiers and to establish the Khilafah (i.e. the Islamic
State)'
<p>In addition he said `I call the Muslims world-wide to resist all man
made law wherever they are and to introduce Islamic law'
<p>&nbsp;He added `It is wrong to burn the US, UK and Israeli flags alone,
rather these must be burnt together with the flags of the Arab regimes
including that of Palestine because the issue of Palestine is not a Palestinian
or Arab issue rather it is an Islamic issue concerning Muslims world-wide.'
<p>Moreover the Sheikh said: `I pray to almighty god to unite Muslims world-wide
against the secular man-made regimes and to implement Islam the way God
has united the Muslims world-wide against the occupiers'

<p><b><font size=+1>Al-Muhajiroun: background</font></b></center>

<p>Al-Muhajiroun seeks to establish a "world Islamic state." The group's
leader, Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad, is a judge of the Shari'ah Court of
the UK. He was the founding leader of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, the Islamic Liberation
Party in Britain before splitting from the Party over differences with
it's Middle Eastern-based leadership.
<p>Muhammad, who sought asylum in Britain after leaving his native Syria
advocates setting up an Islamic state in the U.K. "One day the black flag
of Islam will be flying over Downing Street," says another al-Muhajiroun
organizer, Anjem Choudray.
<p>In 1998 al-Muhajiroun led protests in London against the British role
in compelling Iraq to allow inspection of weapons sites. It has called
on Muslims to use "all means" to oppose the Britain and its American allies.
In December, 1999 the group issued a <i>fatwa</i> bearing the authority
of&nbsp; the Shari'ah Court of the UK, following a ruling by the Beirut-based
International Islamic Front, calling for the assassination of Russian President
Yeltsin. The group said the Russian embassy in London and similar establishments
were also "legitimate targets."
<p><b>Links to Osama bin Ladin</b>
<br>But al-Muhajiroun is best known as the only Western-based Islamic group
that came out in open support of the bombings of the American Embassies
in East Africa in August 1998. Muhammad claims to act as a spokesman of
Osama bin Laden. Throughout 1998 the al-Muhajiroun website carried bin
Laden's communiqu&eacute;s.
<p>After the attacks against the American Embassies, the group published
an endorsement of the bombings, saying "Al-Muhajiroun salutes the message
that has been sent - American interests are not safe anywhere in the world."
<p><b>ICT's Ely Karmon Comments:</b>
<br>This fatwa is in fact a call to all Muslims to perpetrate acts of terrorism,
not only in Palestine against Israelis, or against Israeli military forces,
but also all over the world against “Israeli embassies and companies…interests,
airports and institutions.”&nbsp; This call to arms in fact contradicts
the prohibition not “to target any non-military or innocent Jews because
this would be considered to be murder.”
<p>It should be remembered that al-Muhajiroun was one of the few Islamist
groups that openly and publicly supported Osama bin-Laden’s terrorist attacks
against the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenia and Dar-es-Salam, Tanzania,
in August 1998.
<p>This support to the most extremist element in the international Islamist
network is a proof of the larger goals of these movements. There goals
include the “liberation” of the Muslim lands form atheist or corrupt Muslim
regimes, the fight against the influence and presence of the Western “imperialist”
countries on Muslim soil and the eradication of the “Zionist entity” from
Palestine. However they also seek to bring about the establishment of the
Islamic empire (Al-Khilafah) and the domination of Islam all over the world,
so candidly expressed by the al-Muhajiroun in its London demonstrations.
