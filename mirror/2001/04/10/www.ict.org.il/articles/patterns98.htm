<center><b><font size=+1>Patterns of Global Terrorism 1998 - What has Changed</font></b></center>
<br><b>Yoram Schweitzer,</b>
<br><b>ICT Research Fellow</b>
<p>In April the U.S. State Department published its latest annual report
on terrorism world-wide. The report is a yearly reappraisal of world
terrorism required by the United States Congress.&nbsp; It includes information
on international terrorist organizations, a yearly chronicle of terror
attacks, and a report on states sponsoring terrorism.&nbsp; This last section
has a special impact on U.S. foreign policy, as those states designated
supporters of terrorism are subject to diplomatic and economic sanctions.
This year’s report shed light on some important features of the current
international terror scene.
<p><b>Number of terrorist incidents decreased, Number of casualties rose</b>
<p>There was a decrease in the number of international terror attacks (the
lowest since the beginning of the 90’s. At the same time there was a sharp
increase of the number of casualties. This cannot be attributed solely
to the deadly results of the simultaneous attacks on the American embassies
in East Africa, although they definitely contributed to the total high
number of casualties this year.
<p><b>Sunni Extremism</b>
<p>The Sunni Muslim terror groups, dominated by the “Afghan alumni” continued
to play a major role in the international arena. This phenomenon—epitomized
by the Saudi millionaire Osama bin Ladin, himself, an Afghan alumnus—was
institutionalized when Bin Ladin announced in February ‘98 the creation
of an Islamic coalition called “The International Islamic front for Jihad
against the Jews &amp; the Crusaders.”
<p><b>Effective counter-terrorism</b>
<p>Despite the “successful” attacks carried out by the al-Qaida/Islamic
Front in Kenya and Tanzania, Bin Ladin’s coalition suffered a serious setback
due to the countermeasures taken against its members by the United States
and its allies. Some of al-Qaida’s leading figures were arrested in various
countries, primarily in the UK, Germany and Italy. Several of these were
extradited to the United States. The Egyptian terror groups, who play a
major role in the Islamic terror network also suffered a heavy blow from
the security forces in Egypt. With the active cooperation of the U.S. Egypt
arrested a few dozen terrorists from the al-Jihad group in countries as
diverse as Azarbiejan, Albania, South Africa, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates. Most of these were to Egypt to stand trial.
These arrests badly crippled the Front’s current capabilities, while possibly
increasing their motivation for retaliatory attacks against their adversaries.
<p>Throughout 1998 the United States pushed for vigorous punitive action
against Islamic terrorism. At the beginning of the year Ramzi Yousef was
sentenced to 240 years in prison by a United States federal court. Following
the bombings of the embassies in East Africa, the U.S. lead a world-wide
manhunt for members of bin Laden’s network, resulting in the extradition
of several of the organization’s senior members from Britain and Germany.
<p><b>State-sponsored terrorism</b>
<p>The “traditional” state sponsors of terrorism have been very careful
to avoid any direct involvement in international terrorist activity in
1998. Iran, despite its continuous support for various terrorist organizations,
has been relegated to a secondary role in this year’s report. This is due
to the desire on the part of the U.S. for an improvement in relations with
Iran. Thus, as a gesture of political good will Iran was not defined as
the primary state-sponsor of terrorism. However Iran continues to exert
great influence on international terrorism through its continuos aid to
groups such as Hizballah, Hamas, PIJ, GIA, Gama’a al-Islamiya and others.
Primarily this aid takes the form of training and upgrading the capabilities
of these groups to carry out attacks.
