Mean?</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><a href="#author">Douglas E. Streusand</a></font>
<p><i><font face="Times,Times New Roman">This article was published by
Middle East Quarterly in September 1997</font></i>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Jihad, routinely translated as <i>holy
war</i>, often makes headlines. For example, Yasir Arafat’s May 1994 call
in Johannesburg for a “jihad to liberate Jerusalem”[1] was a turning point
in the peace process; Israelis heard him speak about using violence to
gain political ends, and questioned his peaceable intentions. Both Arafat
himself [2] and his aides[3] then clarified that he was speaking about
a “peaceful jihad” for Jerusalem.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">This incident points to the problem
with the word jihad: what exactly does it mean? Two examples from leading
American Muslim organizations, both fundamentalist, show the extent of
disagreement this issue inspires. The Council on American-Islamic Relations,
a Washington-based group, flatly states that jihad “does not mean `holy
war.’” Rather, it refers to “a central and broad Islamic concept that includes
the struggle to improve the quality of life in society, struggle in the
battlefield for self-defense . . . or fighting against tyranny or oppression.”
CAIR even asserts that Islam knows no such concept as “holy war.”[4] In
abrupt contrast, the Muslim Students Association recently distributed an
item with a Kashmir dateline, “Diary of a Mujahid.” The editor of this
document understands jihad very much to mean armed conflict:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times,Times New Roman">While we dream of jihad
and some deny it, while others explain it away, and yet others frown on
it to hide their own weakness and reluctance towards it, here is a snapshot
from the diary of a mujahid who had fulfilled his dream to be on the battlefield.[5]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times,Times New Roman">Does jihad mean a form of moral self-improvement
or war in accord with Islamic precepts? There is no simple answer to this
question, for Muslims for at least a millennium have disagreed about the
meaning of jihad. But there is an answer.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jihad as Warfare</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Jihad</font> is a verbal noun with
the literal meaning of striving or determined effort. The active participle
mujahid means someone who strives or a participant in jihad.
<p>The term jihad in many contexts means fighting (though there are other
words in Arabic that more unambiguously refer to the act of making war,
such as qital or harb). In the Qur’an and in later Muslim usage, jihad
is commonly followed by the expression <i>fi sabil Illah</i>, “in the path
of God.”[6] The description of warfare against the enemies of the Muslim
community as jihad fi sabil Illah sacralized an activity that otherwise
might have appeared as no more than the tribal warfare endemic in pre-Islamic
Arabia.
<p>After the Qur’an, the <i>Hadith</i> (reports on the sayings and acts
of the prophet) is the second most important source of Islamic law (Shari`a).
In <i>Hadith</i> collections, jihad means armed action; for example, the
199 references to jihad in the most standard collection of <i>hadith</i>,
<i>Sahih
al-Bukhari</i>, all assume that jihad means warfare.[7] More broadly, Bernard
Lewis finds that “the overwhelming majority of classical theologians, jurists,
and traditionalists [i.e., specialists in the Hadith] . . . understood
the obligation of jihad in a military sense.”[8]
<p>These figures formed one distinct interpretation of jihad as war and
Ibn Taymiya and his followers formed another. For the jurists, jihad fits
a context of the world divided into Muslim and non-Muslim zones, <i>Dar
al-Islam</i> (Abode of Islam) and <i>Dar al-Harb</i> (Abode of War) respectively.
This model implies perpetual warfare between Muslims and non-Muslims until
the territory under Muslim control absorbs what is not, an attitude that
perhaps reflects the optimism that resulted from the quick and far-reaching
Arab conquests. Extending Dar al-Islam does not mean the annihilation of
all non-Muslims, however, nor even their necessary conversion. Indeed,
jihad cannot imply conversion by force, for the Qur’an (2:256) specifically
states “there is no compulsion in religion.” Jihad has an explicitly political
aim: the establishment of Muslim rule, which in turn has two benefits:
it articulates Islam’s supersession of other faiths and creates the opportunity
for Muslims to create a just political and social order.
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jihad cannot imply
conversion by force.</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Islamic jurisprudence divides the
inhabitants of Dar al-Harb (known as <i>harbis</i>) into two: People of
the Book (<i>Ahl al-Kitab</i>) and polytheists. People of the Book, defined
in the Qur’an as Christians, Jews, and Sabeans, have a distinct status
in Muslim eyes because they follow a genuine—if incomplete—revelation from
a genuine prophet. They may live undisturbed under Muslim rule so long
as they accept a subordinate status (that of the <i>dhimmi</i>) which entails
paying a tribute (<i>jizya</i>) and suffering a wide range of disabilities.
As for polytheists, the law requires Muslims to offer them the choice of
Islam or death, though this was rarely followed after the initial Muslim
conquest of Arabia. Instead, Muslims generally treated all <i>harbi</i>s
as People of the Book. The jurists first sanctioned the inclusion of Zoroastrians
in this category; Muslim conquerors of the Indian subcontinent extended
it to Hindus as well, thereby effectively eliminating the category of polytheists.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The belief that jihad should continue
until Dar al-Islam covers the entire world does not imply that the jurists
expect Muslims to wage non-stop war. The Prophet Muhammad made a peace
agreement with the Meccans in 630, the Treaty of Hudaybiya, and several
of the early caliphs made peace treaties with the Byzantine Empire (some
of which even required them to pay tribute to the Byzantines). Although
there is no mechanism for recognizing a non-Muslim government as legitimate,
the jurists built on these precedents to allow the negotiation of truces
and peace treaties of limited duration. The jurists provide for military
prudence, permitting the withdrawal of badly outnumbered or overpowered
forces. And some jurists added an intermediate category, <i>Dar al-`Ahd</i>
(Abode of Covenant) or <i>Dar al-Sulh</i> (Abode of Peace), for those countries
where non-Muslim rulers govern non-Muslim subjects.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The jurists understand jihad not
as an obligation of each individual Muslim but as a general obligation
of the Muslim community. Only in emergencies, when Dar al-Islam comes under
unexpected attack, do they expect all Muslims to participate in jihad warfare.
Under normal circumstances, the failure of the community to fulfill the
obligation of jihad is sinful; but an individual Muslim need not participate
so long as other Muslims carry the burden. Shi`i writers make a further
qualification, that offensive jihad is permissible only in the presence
of the expected Imam--and thus not under current circumstances.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">In contrast to this consensus view
on a restricted doctrine of jihad, the prominent legal philosopher Ibn
Taymiya (1268-1328) took a more activist position. He declared that a ruler
who fails to enforce the Shari`a rigorously in all its aspects, including
the performance of jihad, forfeits his right to rule. A vigorous critic
of the status quo, Ibn Taymiya strongly advocated, and personally participated
in, jihad as warfare against the Crusaders and Mongols who occupied parts
of Dar al-Islam. Ibn Taymiya developed his outlook by building on a long
tradition of dissidents in Islamic history who directed jihad against rulers
they deemed insuffiently Muslim, including the Kharijis of the seventh
century and the Assassins of the eleventh century.[9] Perhaps most important,
he broke with the mainstream of Islam by his asserting that a professing
Muslim who does not live by the faith is an unbeliever. Most jurists tolerated
Muslim rulers who violated the Shari`a for the sake of the community, finding
tyranny less bad than division or disorder, but Ibn Taymiya insisted on
more.[10] Ibn Taymiya and his associates are the most important intellectual
precursors of contemporary Islamism.[11]</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Warfare as Non-Jihad</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Islamic law condemns all warfare
that does not qualify as jihad, specifically all warfare among Muslims.
Military action against Muslims is justified only by denying them the status
of Muslims, classifying them as apostates or ragainst legitimate authority.[12]
For example, when Caliph al-Ma’mun and his brother al-Amin struggled for
control of the caliphate in 809-13, Ma’mun called Amin an apostate.[13]
Muslim writers use the term <i>fitna</i>, meaning trial or temptation,
to describe divisions within the Muslim community. Though premodern Muslim
writers do not say so, <i>fitna</i> became a permanent condition after
750, when the political unity of the Muslim community (<i>umma</i>) came
to an end.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The earliest Muslim writer to codify
the laws of war and peace, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan Shaybani,[14] wrote only
after the unity had broken down, meaning that Islamic laws on these subjects
was formulated only retrospectively, by deriving general principles from
a situation that no longer existed and would never again exist. In effect,
the law of jihad was formulated after the conditions it fit had passed.
The jurists then sought to reconcile the division and disorder of later
centuries with the theory, but they averted their gaze from the ugly reality
of intra-Muslim warfare all around them. Instead, they primarily sought
to establish the legitimacy of authority in the absence of an effective
caliph ruling a unified Muslim community. Islamic law, in short, never
addressed the reality of political division within the Islamic world.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The division of the Islamic world
did not end its expansion. Jihad in the sense of warfare continued, though
the jihad ideal rarely determined the policies of Muslim regimes and almost
never permitted them to join together against a common non-Muslim foe.
Often the term <i>ghazi</i>, literally raiding, was used as a synonym.
The Ottoman Empire is often called the empire of the <i>ghazi</i>s because
success in jihad was a vital component of Ottoman legitimacy. But jihad
was not the sole motivation, or even the sole ideology, for Ottoman expansion.
Other factors included population pressure, competition with other Muslim
states, and the lure of border warfare. In addition to the doctrine of
jihad, Ottoman political ideology incorporated Turko-Mongol, Iranian, and
Byzantine elements. A similar combination of ideological and other factors
drove Muslim expansion in the Indian subcontinent.[15] In other contexts
too, Muslim rulers such as Uzun Hasan Aqquyunlu, the ruler of western Iran
and eastern Anatolia in 1453-78, and the Safavid Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524-76)
participated in jihad not just for abstract reasons of faith but to enhance
their legitimacy and acquire booty.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jihad as Non-Warfare</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Warfare is only one interpretation
of the concept of jihad. The root meaning of <i>effort</i> never disappeared.
Jihad may be an inward struggle (directed against evil in oneself) or an
outward one (against injustice). A <i>Hadith</i> defines this understanding
of the term. It recounts how Muhammad, after a battle, said “We have returned
from the lesser jihad (<i>al-jihad al-asghar</i>) to the greater jihad
(<i>al-jihad al-akbar</i>).” When asked “What is the greater jihad?,” he
replied “It is the struggle against oneself.”[16] Although this <i>Hadith</i>
does not appear in any of the authoritative collections, it has had enormous
influence in Islamic mysticism (Sufism).</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Sufis understand the greater jihad
as an inner war, primarily a struggle against the base instincts of the
body but also resistance to the temptation of polytheism. Some Sufi writers
assert that Satan organizes the temptation of the body and the world to
corrupt the soul. Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali (1059-1111), probably the
most important figure in Islam’s development after the prophet, describes
the body as a city, governed by the soul, and besieged by the lower self.
Withdrawal from the world to mystical pursuits constitutes an advance in
the greater jihad. Conversely, the greater jihad is a necessary part of
the process of gaining spiritual insight.[17] By the eleventh century Sufism
had become an extremely influential, and perhaps even the dominant, form
of Islamic spirituality. To this day, many Muslims conceive of jihad as
a personal rather than a political struggle. But Sufism provoked opposition,
most importantly from Ibn Taymiya, who condemned many aspects of Sufism
which he believed contradicted the Shari`a. His disciple Ibn al-Qayyim
al-Jawziya (1292-1350) explicitly condemned the doctrine of greater jihad,
discarding as a deliberate fabrication the <i>Hadith</i> that originates
this concept.[18]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Thus did three main views of jihad
coexist in premodern times: the classical legal view of jihad as a compulsory,
communal effort to defend and expand Dar al-Islam; Ibn Taymiya’s notion
of active jihad as an indispensable feature of legitimate rule; and the
Sufi doctrine of greater jihad. It is no surprise that the disagreement
over jihad continues in the modern era.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jihad as Warfare
in Modern Times</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Perhaps the earliest perspective
on jihad from a modern sensibility (i.e., responding to the West) developed
among Indian Muslims in the aftermath of the 1857 uprising (the so-called
Indian Mutiny). Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and others, writing as much for a
Western audience as for their co-religionists, argued that jihad meant
only defensive war and could not justify further resistance to British
rule as long as the British did not actively interfere with the practice
of Islam. Sir Sayyid Ahmad treated Islam as a private religion rather than
a
public force, and presented it as virtually a pacifist creed.[19] Though
clearly a reaction to British suspicions of Muslims after 1857, this view
affected Indian Muslim attitudes.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Modernist writers, seeking to reconcile
Islam with Western ways, looked to the Qur’an to find a Islamic model to
guide Muslim states. They sought a fundamentally defensive vision of jihad,
and toward this end argued that all the wars waged by the prophet and the
first four caliphs were defensive. Contending that the Qur’an requires
Muslims to make peace if their adversaries wish to do so, they include
a Dar al-Sulh in their model of the world. Peace treaties may be permanent
and Muslims may be neutral in international conflicts.[20] The modernists
also work to reconcile Islamic law with international law. Thus, the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, an umbrella organization that includes as members
most Muslim states, expressed an interest in</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">establishing an international court
to reconcile the Shari`a with international public law. Similarly, Muhammad
Shaltut, a former rector of Al-Azhar, contends that the Shari`a’s emphasis
on international peace and the legitimate right of self-defense prefigures
the principles of the United Nations.[21]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Abu al-A`la Mawdudi (1903-79), the
Indian and later Pakistani thinker, was the first Islamist writer to approach
jihad systematically. He presents it not merely as warfare to expand Islamic
political dominance, but also to establish a just rule, one that includes
freedom of religion. Mawdudi’s political life began with participation
in the Khilafat movement, a post-World War I agitation among Indian Muslims
that, among other causes, supported Indian independence from Great Britain.
In keeping with this outlook, jihad for Mawdudi was akin to war of liberation;
Islamic rule means freedom and justice, even for non-Muslims.</font>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Islam wants to employ all the forces
and means that can be employed for bringing about a universal, all-embracing
revolution. It will spare no efforts for the achievement of this supreme
objective. This far-reaching struggle that continuously exhausts all forces
employment of all possible means are called jihad.</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Times,Times New Roman">Mawdudi’s outlook significantly changes
jihad, beginning its association with anticolonialism and “national liberation
movements” that seek not to expand Islamic rule but to establish independent
states -- not to force non-Muslims to accept <i>dhimmi</i> status but to
make them politically independent. Mawdudi’s approach paved the way for
Arab resistance to Zionism and Israel to be called jihad. In this spirit,
the rector of Cairo’s Al-Azhar University contended in 1973 that all Egyptians,
Christians included, must participate in jihad against Israel.[23] And
thus did the secular PLO make itself the leader of an secularized jihad
-- as in Arafat’s statement about a “jihad to liberate Jerusalem.”</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Although Mawdudi’s conception opens
the door to a secular and nationalist interpretation of jihad, neither
he nor his acolytes went through that door. Such Islamist thinkers such
as Hasan al-Banna (1906-49) and Sayyid Qutb (1906-56) followed Mawdudi’s
emphasis on its role in establishing a truly Islamic government. For them,
as for Ibn Taymiya, jihad includes the overthrow of governments that fail
to enforce the Shari`a. Jihad here again subsumes the idea of revolution,
though this time a purely Islamic one. Before directing jihad against external
enemies, Muslims must first deal with their own rulers. If leaders such
as Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar as-Sadat are not true Muslims, they cannot
lead jihad, not even against a legitimate target of jihad (such as Israel).Significantly,
Islamists consider jihad mandatory for all Muslims, making it an individual
rather than a communal duty.[24]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The <i>Neglected Duty</i>, a pamphlet
produced by Sadat’s assassins to explain and justify this use of violence,
is perhaps the purest expression of this Islamist perspective on jihad.
(Its author, Muhammad `Abd al-Salam Faraj was executed along with the actual
killers.) It argues that jihad as armed action is the cornerstone and heart
of Islam; the neglect of jihad has caused the current depressed position
of Islam in the world. Force must be used, for it alone can destroy idols.
Abraham and Muhammad both began their careers by smashing idols; the Islamists
propose to follow their example. <i>The Neglected Duty</i> defines the
current rulers of the Muslim world (such as Sadat) as apostates, despite
their profession of Islam and obedience to some of its laws, and advocates
their execution. <i>The Neglected Duty</i> is explicitly messianic, asserting
that Muslims must “exert every conceivable effort” to bring about the establishment
of truly Islamic government, a restoration of the caliphate, and the expansion
of Dar al-Islam; and their success is inevitable.[25]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Shi`i revolutionaries have a similar
perspective. Ayatollah Khomeini (1903-89) contends that jurists, “by means
of jihad and enjoining the good and forbidding the evil,[26] must expose
and overthrow tyrannical rulers and rouse the people so the universal movement
of all alert Muslims can establish Islamic government in the place of tyrannical
regimes.” The proper teaching of Islam will cause “the entire population
to become <i>mujahid</i>s.”[27] Ayatollah Muhammad Mutahhari, a top ideologue
of the Iranian Revolution, considers jihad a necessary consequence of Islam’s
content; having political aims, Islam must sanction armed force and provide
laws for its use. Mutahhari deems jihad defensive; but his definition includes
the defense against oppression and this may require what international
law would consider a war of aggression. For example, he endorses an attack
on a country of polytheists, not to impose Islam but to eliminate the evils
of polytheism. Mutahhari finds that the doctrine of jihad marks Islam’s
superiority over Christianity, for Christianity lacks the political and
social agenda necessary for a doctrine of jihad.[28]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">This survey indicates that while
the concept of jihad retains a special place among the Islamists, the spiritual
descendants of Ibn Taymiya, other Islamic thinkers of the modern age have
developed distinctive approaches to this issue.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jihad as Non-Warfare
in Modern Times</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Two groups of contemporary Muslims
have articulated doctrines of peaceful jihad. Modernists may see the concept
as central to the religion but see it as encompassing all forms of political
and social action to establish justice. Fazlur Rahman, a Pakistani scholar
and long-time professor at the University of Chicago, argued that it had
to exist to accomplish Islam’s social and political agenda. “There is no
doubt that the Qur’an wanted Muslims to establish a political order on
earth for the sake of creating an egalitarian and just moral-social order.
Jihad is the instrument for doing so.”[29] In this spirit, President Habib
Bourguiba of Tunisia used jihad to describe the struggle for economic development
in Tunisia, much as Lyndon Johnson spoke of a “War on Poverty.” In this
context, jihad imply no more violence than does crusade in today’s English.[30]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The Sufi doctrine of greater jihad
remains alive. Though less influential than Islamism in the political realm,
it may have more impact on the spiritual life of Muslims, at least in Egypt
where one writer contends that the number of Egyptians active in Sufism
may well exceed the number of Islamists.[31] Sadat wrote articles for the
first issues of Sufi journals in 1958 and 1979, both entitled “The Greater
Jihad,” in which he welcomed the diffusion of Sufi ideas.[32] On the basis
of field work in Egypt, the Sudan, and Tunisia, an anthropologist mentions
<i>jihad</i>
only in the context of the Ramadan fast: “Fasting for the whole month is
a . . . personal trial for Muslims . . . a form of personal
<i>jihad</i>
. . . part of the more difficult inner struggles with the flesh and worldy
appetites.”[33]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The Sufi outlook remains important
enough so that Islamists like Hasan al-Banna and <i>The Neglected Duty</i>
feel compelled to repeat medieval criticisms of greater <i>jihad</i>.[34]
This criticism, plus the prevalent definition of <i>jihad</i> as warfare,
causes Sufis often to employ <i>mujahada</i>, a related word for <i>al-jihad
al-akbar</i>.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Impact of Jihad</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The concept of <i>jihad</i> as a
moral struggle touches the daily lives of many Muslims, and not only Sufis.
<i>Jihad</i>
as warfare, though far better known, has had a narrower impact. In some
cases, like the assassination of Sadat, <i>jihad</i> as warfare has had
enormous consequences. But it has never mobilized Muslims en masse or transcended
the ethnic and political divisions within the Muslim world. Few Muslim
governments, and few individual Muslims, have acted in accord with doctrine.
The conception of <i>jihad</i> as warfare in defense of the Dar al-Islam
did not produce a Pan-Islamic resistance to colonialism. The many movements
that arose to resist European expansion or occupation were regional or
local, tied to a specific leader, regime, or other specific circumstances;
at no time did a <i>jihad</i> movement arise which united Muslims with
geographic, sectarian, or political differences. In most cases,
<i>jihad</i>
against colonialism formed a part of program of religious reform and renewal.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The most systematic attempt to mobilize
Muslims against the West, the Ottoman declaration of <i>jihad</i> against
the Allies in 1914, failed entirely. With its declaration of war, the Ottoman
regime simultaneously published a <i>fatwa</i> (ruling according to the
Shari`a) calling the war a <i>jihad</i> that every Muslim had to participate
in -- including the Muslim subjects of Russia, France, and Great Britain.
To secure the widest possible circulation, the fatwa was published in Arabic,
Persian, Urdu, and Turkish. But the fatwa did not cause significant Muslim
defections from the Allied cause, nor did it prevent the Arab Revolt against
Muslim rule.[35]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">More recent invocations of <i>jihad</i>
have been equally ineffective. Frequent calls for <i>jihad</i> against
Israel have not overcome division among Israel’s opponents or produced
an effective mobilization of their capability against Israel. Saddam Husayn’s
call for a jihad against the United States, part of an overall effort to
Islamize the image of his secular regime, may have resonated among Islamists
but they did not affect the outcome of the crisis. The same applies to
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatullah `Ali Khamanei’s similar designation of
war against U.S. forces as jihad. Neither pronouncement had significant
political or military results.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Even in Afghanistan, where resistance
fighters went by the title <i>mujahidin</i>, the idea of jihad had surprisingly
little power. The Afghan cause did attract considerable support from the
rest of the Islamic world, but only three Islamic states (Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, and Iran) actually allocated significant resources to the mujahidin.
The other outside participants in the Afghan resistance wereindividuals
who represented a marginal element within the Islamic world. (Marginal
but not insignificant: they later formed an Islamist cadre blamed for Islamist
extremism in other parts of the Islamic world, especially North Africa.)
Moreover, the concept of jihad did not unite the Afghan resistance, which
remained divided by social, political, ethnic, and ideological differences.
Although the resistance groups all considered themselves <i>mujahidin</i>,
they perceived different paths of God and sought to produce different results
in human terms. These groups did not cooperate effectively and often fought
each other rather than the Soviets. The concept of jihad had little direct
influence on the course of the Afghan war.[36] After the Soviet withdrawal
and the establishment of a new government they continue to fight each other.[37]</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Most Muslims do not see jihad as
warfare as an active obligation, upon either themselves or the Muslim community
as a whole. Reinhold Loeffler, working in a tribal village in southern
Iran, encountered cogent criticisms of the Islamic Republic’s conception
of jihad. One informant asserted: “young men with no proper training go
to the front and are senselessly killed. I don’t believe they are martyrs
going to paradise.” Another one contrasted Khomeini’s preaching with the
conduct of the Imam Husayn: “before his final battle the Imam Husayn exempted
his followers from the obligation of jihad so that they might save their
lives. Khomeini, however, pitilessly incites people to go to their deaths.”
A father spoke of his son: “My son now is telling me about the true Islam;
they have to fight a holy war (he says) and of necessity get killed. I
tell him there is no holy war in the absence of the Last Imam.”[38] This
anecdotal evidence suggests that the Islamic Republic’s invocation of jihad
met with mixed emotions, not universal enthusiasm.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What Does Jihad
Mean?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Muslims today can mean many things
by jihad—the jurists’ warfare bounded by specific conditions, Ibn Taymiya’s
revolt against an impious ruler, the Sufi’s moral self-improvement, or
the modernist’s notion of political and social reform. The disagreement
among Muslims over the interpretation of jihad is genuine and deeply rooted
in the diversity of Islamic thought. The unmistakable predominance of jihad
as warfare in Shar`i writing does not mean that Muslims today must view
jihad as the jurists did a millennium ago. Classical texts speak only to,
not for, contemporary Muslims. A non-Muslim cannot assert that jihad always
means violence or that all Muslims believe in jihad as warfare.</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Conversely, the discord over the
meaning of jihad permits deliberate deception, such as the CAIR statement
cited above. A Muslim can honestly dismiss jihad as warfare, but he cannot
deny the existence of this concept. As the editor of the “Diary of a Mujahid”
writes, “some deny it, while others explain it away, yet others frown on
it to hide their own weakness.”</font>
<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The term jihad should cause little
confusion, for context almost always indicates what a speaker intends.
The variant interpretations are so deeply embedded in Islamic intellectual
traditions that the usage of jihad is unlikely to be ambiguous. An advocate
of jihad as warfare indicates so through his goals. A Sufi uses the term
<i>mujahada</i>
or specifies the greater jihad. Bourguiba clearly did not advocate violence
to improve education and development in Tunisia. When ambiguity does exist,
it may well be deliberate. In the case of Arafat’s statement about a “jihad
for Jerusalem,” he intended his Muslim audience to hear a call to arms
while falling back on the peaceful definition to allay concerns in Israel
and the West. Only his later actions reveal whether he was coopting Islamists
by adopting their rhetoric or duping Israelis by hiding his violent intentions.</font>
