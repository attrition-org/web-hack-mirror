<TD>If he were using the same methods to run a huge software empire, we
would laud Osama bin Ladin as a clever capitalist; we would envy him his
marketing savvy, or jealously deride him for his riches. However, Osama
bin Ladin is not in the software business; his business is international
terrorism. Bin Ladin is the prototype of a new breed of terrorist, the
private entrepreneur who puts modern enterprise at the service of a world-wide
network of terrorists. He makes effective use of all the tried and true
methods of marketing, management, privatization and advertising.</TD>

<P>Osama bin Ladin is one of 53 children of Saudi construction magnate
Muhammad Awad bin Ladin. His mother was reportedly a Palestinian, and the
least favored of his father’s ten wives. The elder bin Ladin moved to Saudi
Arabia from Yemen and amassed a fortune. Most of this money came from a
number of successful construction and contracting companies. Today, the
bin Ladin family fortune is estimated at $5 billion, of which Osama has
access to an estimated $300 million. He tends to see himself as the model
businessman, a graduate of Riyadh University’s management and economics
department. The only difference is, his product is war.

<P><B>The education of a Mujahedin</B>
<BR>Bin Ladin entered on his current path of holy warrior in 1979. That
was the year Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. Osama moved his business
to Afghanistan--several hundred loyal workmen, some heavy construction
tools--and set out to liberate the land from the infidel invader. Recognizing
at once that the Afghans were lacking both infrastructure and manpower
to fight a protracted conflict, he set about solving both problems at once.
The first step was to set up an organized program of conscription. He advertised
all over the Arab world for young Muslims to come to fight in Afghanistan.
He paid for their transportation to Afghanistan, and set up facilities
to train them. The Afghan government donated land and resources, while
bin Ladin brought in experts from all over the world on guerilla warfare,
sabotage, and covert operations. Within a little over a year he had thousands
of volunteers in training in his private bootcamps.

<P><B>Superpower vs. superpower</B>
<BR>But the war in Afghanistan was not a tribal hill feud; it was the stage
for one of the last major stand-offs between the two superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union. The Americans at that time had the same goals
as bin Ladin’s mujahedin--the ousting of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
In what was hailed at the time as one of its most successful covert operations,
America’s Central Intelligence Agency launched a $500 million-per-year
campaign to arm and train the impoverished and outgunned mujahedin guerrillas
to fight the Soviet Union. The most promising guerilla leaders were sought
out and “sponsored” by the CIA. U.S. official sources are understandably
vague on the question of whether Osama bin Ladin was one of the CIA’s “chosen”
at that time. Bin Ladin’s group was one of seven main mujahedin factions.
It is estimated that a significant quantity of high tech American weapons,
including “stinger” anti-aircraft missiles, made their way into his arsenal.
The majority of them are reported to be still there.

<P>What is certain is that the CIA plan was wildly successful. The
mujahedin vanquished the Soviet Union in ten years of savage fighting.
What had begun as a fragmented army of tribal warriors ended up a well-organized
and equipped modern army--one capable of beating a super power. The departing
Soviet troops left behind an Afghanistan with a huge arsenal of sophisticated
weapons and thousands of seasoned Islamic warriors from a variety of countries.

<P><B>The Afghan Veterans</B>
<BR>Some of these veterans returned to their own countries and got on with
their lives. Others returned to their own countries steeped in Islamic
fundamentalism and a will to topple “western-influenced, infidel governments”
in favor of Islamic regimes. They used the knowledge gleaned in the Afghan
war to set up guerilla and terror cells. In Egypt and Algeria, the “Afghan
Veterans,” as they came to be called, aided Islamic extremists in their
fight against the secular governments. In most Arab countries, the veterans
were not at all welcome, and the governments kept a close eye on their
doings. However, in some countries the Afghan veterans were accorded a
warm welcome. Such was the case in Sudan, where the government gave them
jobs, helped them to set up training camps, and appointed some of them
to government posts.

<P>In addition to these facilities established in “friendly” Arab countries,
the majority of the mujahedin training camps in Afghanistan continued to
operate, supplying Islamic mercenaries to conflicts in a number of countries.
Afghanistan was still seen as the hearth-stone of the mujahedin, from whence
trained fighters could be sent out to fight wherever they were needed.
Mujahedin veterans began showing up in Islamic struggles in such places
as Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Chechnya.

<P><B>A state unto himself</B>
<BR>Meanwhile, Osama bin Ladin returned to his native Saudi Arabia to take
up the fight against the infidel government there. The Saudis were not
disposed to tolerate his calls to insurrection, and quickly acted against
him. In April 1994, his Saudi citizenship was revoked for “irresponsible
behavior,” and he was expelled from the country. Together with his family
and a large band of followers, Bin Ladin moved to Khartoum in Sudan. There
he set up factories and farms, some of which were established solely for
the purpose of supplying jobs to out-of-work mujahedin. He built roads
and infrastructure for the Sudanese government and training
camps for the Afghan Veterans. Among bin Ladin’s numerous Sudanese commercial
interests are: a factory to process goat skins, a construction company, a bank,
a sunflower plantation, and an import-export operation.

<P>His construction company “el-Hijrah for
Construction and Development Ltd.”--in partnership
with the National Islamic Front and the Sudanese military--built the
new airport at Port Sudan, as well as a 1200 km-long highway
linking Khartoum to Port Sudan.

<P>Another company reputed to be owned by bin Ladin is the “Wadi al-Aqiq”
Company, an export-import firm.&nbsp; He also runs the Taba Investment
Company Ltd. and the “el-Shamal Islamic Bank” in Khartoum, a joint effort
with the&nbsp; NIF, in which bin Ladin is said to have&nbsp; invested $50
million.

<P>For many years, bin Ladin lived in Khartoum, in
a residence guarded by the local security forces, while he was arranging
for many of the “Afghan veterans” to move to Sudan.&nbsp; Bin Ladin is
said to be close to Sudanese&nbsp; leader Omar Albashir, and to Hassan
Turabi, the head of the National Islamic Front (NIF) in Sudan.


<P>However, Sudan--long on the U.S. State Department’s list of state sponsors
of terrorism--in recent years began to thaw toward the West. As a gesture
toward the United States, the Sudanese government requested that bin Ladin
depart. In May 1996, he moved to Afghanistan, leaving behind him in Sudan
a network of Afghan Veterans and several successful factories and corporations.
Several major companies in Sudan are linked to him, and are believed to
be doing double-duty as logistics support for bin Ladin’s network. 

<P><B>Chemical weapons in Sudan?</B>
<BR>In addition, bin Ladin is suspected of being one of the principal
investors in the “al-Shifa”
pharmaceuticals factory, which western intelligence agencies claim was a
front for chemical weapons manufacture. The plant was said to have been
built with the assistance of Iraqi technicians, as part of an effort to
disperse Iraqi chemical weapons technology. Israeli and American
sources have claimed that
the main product to the plant was a key component in VX nerve gas.

<P>According to recent reports in the American press, this claim is based
in part on the existence of traces of the chemical EMPTA
(o-ethylmethylphosphonothioic acid) in a soil sample taken from the vicinity
of the factory.  EMPTA is an essential ingredient in the production
of the deadly nerved gas. The mere possibility that the “al-Shifa” plant
was engaged in the manufacture of such a weapon is enough to send shivers down
the spines of counter-terrorism experts.  VX is
considered an ideal weapon for terrorist attacks, as it is relatively easy
to transport, and quite difficult to detect by conventional security devices.



<P><B>Return to Afghanistan</B>
<BR>In Afghanistan, bin Ladin was given a house and a force of bodyguards
by the Taliban, now in control of most of the country. He quickly entrenched
himself in a mountain fortress near the city of Kandahar. There he is held
in awe by his followers, who have given him the title “Sheikh,” though
he is not a cleric.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE WIDTH="100%" >
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD width="50%">Since setting up shop in Afghanistan, bin Ladin has put his extensive
international network to effective use. Working through high-tech means,
such as faxes, satellite telephones, and the internet, he manages to keep
in touch with an unknown number of followers all over the Arab world, as
well as in Europe, the United States and Canada. He has issued three "<I>fatwahs</I>"
or religious rulings calling upon Muslims to take up arms against the United
States. (see <A HREF="../articles/fatwah.htm">Bin Ladin’s
Declaration of War</A>) In February 1998, he announced the formation of
an umbrella organization called “The Islamic World Front for the struggle
against the Jews and the Crusaders” <I>(Al-Jabhah al-Islamiyyah al-`Alamiyyah
li-Qital al-Yahud wal-Salibiyyin) </I>Among the members of this organization
are the Egyptian <A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=12">al-Gama’a
al-Islamiyya</A> and the Egyptian <A HREF="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18">al-Jihad</A>.
Both of these groups were have been active in terrorism over the past decade.

<B>“This time the intelligence evidence was enough.”</B>
<BR>Although bin Ladin is suspected of involvement in a whole string of
terrorist attacks on American targets, it’s interesting to note that no
one was able to produce incontrovertible proof that his hand was the one
on the trigger. At least this was the case until August 15<SUP>th</SUP>,
when Mohammed Sadiq Odeh was arrested at Karachi International Airport
in Pakistan. Though, it’s difficult to tell exactly what finally tipped
the balance of evidence, it seems likely that Odeh’s description of bin
Ladin’s international network--and his role in the bombing of the American
embassies--is what tipped the scales. MSNBC News recently quoted senior
U.S. officials as saying, “most of the intelligence” gathered on the bin
Laden terrorist network was electronic eavesdropping gathered from the
U.S. spy satellites and ground-based facilities. The U.S. had been trying
for some time to “get connected” to bin Ladin’s network. “The East Africa
bombings provided us with the opportunity,” a Pentagon official said. Reportedly,
the U.S. had intercepted communications linking bin Ladin to the bombings
within a few days after they occurred, something that was impossible to
attain in connection with previous attacks. According to an Israeli source,
setting up an accurate attack on bin Ladin’s bases was a relatively simple
matter. “They just had to switch their electronics from ‘receive’ to ‘send.’”

<P>In a recent interview on Israel television, Shabtai Shavit, former
head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, commenting
on the American strikes against bin Ladin’s networks said that, “For the
United States, it has always been important to obtain evidence that will
hold up in a court of law.” However, he added, “It would seem that this
time the intelligence evidence was enough.”
