<p>According to the Govt. of India, the brutal massacre of 36 Sikhs in
a village near Srinagar by terrorists on the night of March 20 was carried
out by terrorists belonging to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba (Army
of the Pure) and the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).
<p>Since 1996, practically all acts of terrorism in Jammu &amp; Kashmir
have been carried out by the Lashkar, which is the militant wing of the
Markaz Dawa Al Irshad, the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM), formerly known as
the Harkat-ul-Ansar, which has been declared by the US as an international
terrorist organisation since October, 1997, the HM, which is the militant
wing of the Jamat-e-Islami of Kashmir, and the Al Badr, a splinter group
of the HM. The Lashkar and the HUM consist almost entirely of Pakistani
and Afghan nationals, with many of the Afghans coming from the Nuristan
area of Eastern Afghanistan. They also have a small number of Arab mercenaries
of Afghan war vintage.
<p>The HM has a large percentage of Kashmiris recruited on both sides of
the Line of Control (LoC) and the Al Badr is essentially an organisation
of Pakistani nationals, most of them Pakhtuns from the North-West Frontier
Province (NWFP). The Al Badr was created by the ISI in the then East Pakistan
in 1971 and massacred over 10,000 Bengali intellectuals. It disappeared
from view after 1971 and made its appearance again in Afghanistan in the
1980s and then in Kashmir as an integral part of the HM, from which it
split and started operating separately.
<p>The Deobandi-Wahabi extremist influence is the strongest on the Lashkar
and the HUM, moderate on the HM and weak on the Al Badr. The Lashkar and
the HUM, almost entirely, and the HM, partly, recruit their volunteers
from the religious madrasas of Pakistan through the Tablighi Jamaat, headed
by Lt.Gen. (retd) Javed Nasir, former ISI Director-General, who was removed
in 1993 by Mr.Nawaz Sharif, then Prime Minister in his first tenure, under
US pressure due to his involvement with terrorist organisations in a number
of countries and other reasons.
<p>However, the Al Badr recruits its cadres largely from the non-religious
educational institutions. It has the largest number of educated cadres--many
of them engineers, doctors, software experts and other professionals. One
of its cadres killed during the Kargil conflict last year was a commercial
pilot.
<p>The Lashkar, the HUM and the Al Badr are members of Osama bin Laden's
International Islamic Front For Jihad Against the US and Israel, whereas
the HM is not. While the Lashkar and the HUM have close relations with
the Taliban, which has allowed them to run their training camps in its
territory, those of the HM have been strained because of its continuing
support to Gulbuddin Heckmatyar of the Hizbe Islami. As a result, it does
not have any training camps in Afghan territory. After breaking with the
HM, the Al Badr has been trying to mend its relations with the Taliban.
<p>Despite these differences, these organisations co-operate at the ground
level in Kashmir and Syed Salahuddin, the Amir of the HM, is the head of
the 14-member United Jehad Council, based in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-Occupied
Kashmir (POK).
<p>Before the coup on October 12 last year, Mr.Nawaz Sharif, partly under
US pressure and partly due to his own concern over their activities, had
ordered the ISI to round up the cadres of these organisations and there
were indications that he was planning to ban the Lashkar and the HUM.
<p>After the coup, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Chief Executive, released
all the arrested cadres and has resisted US pressure to ban them. On the
contrary, he has allowed them to hold public rallies against India all
over Pakistan, without the display of arms, whereas under Mr.Sharif and
Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, they were allowed to hold rallies only in their respective
headquarters.
<p>Abdullah Muntazir, spokesman of the Lashkar, told the "News" (February
20) of Islamabad: " A few weeks before the military coup, the police arrested
more than 500 supporters of our four major groups waging jehad against
the Indians in Kashmir and raided our offices in various cities. Rumours
were rife that the Govt. planned to ban our annual gathering. We were worried
and prayed to Allah to remove the obstacles in our way. Our prayers were
answered with Nawaz's removal."
<p>Mr.Ilyas Khan, Pakistani columnist, wrote in the "Herald" (January 2000)
of the "Dawn" group of publications: " In October, 1999, former Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif publicly acknowledged the Taliban links of Pakistan's terrorists
saying "we have made it clear to the Taliban that this is not acceptable".
However, since the military take-over, Islamabad has remained silent over
the issue, presumably because this would antagonise the Deobandi militants
who have acted as the linchpin in Pakistan's Kashmir policy."
<p>Even in the past, the Lashkar and the HUM were describing their ultimate
objective as the liberation of the Muslims of the rest of India, after
having liberated those in Kashmir. Now, the entire United Jehad Council
is projecting its mission as "Jehad-e-Hind" ("Jehad for the liberation
of India") as against their past mission of Jehad-e-Kashmir.
<p>Gen.Musharraf has also been pressuring these organisations to dissolve
their individual identities and form a United Kashmir Liberation Organisation,
on the model of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
<p>The Pakistan Muslim League (PML), the Pakistan People's Party (PPP)
and Mr. Abdul Qayyum Khan, of the POK Muslim Conference and former Prime
Minister of the POK, have strongly advised Gen. Musharraf against his policies
which, they apprehend, might prove suicidal, as Mr.Qayyum Khan has put
it.
<p>Sardar Kosa, a PML member of the suspended National Assembly, said ("Nation"
of February 13):" Declaring such a jehad against an independent country
without any provocation will be quite diabolical and beyond my imagination."
<p>Mr.Khalid Ahmad Kharal of the PPP was quoted by the same paper as follows:
" While Jehad-e-Kashmir is a separate issue, Jehad-e-Hind is tantamount
to declaring a war against a sovereign and independent country. It is inconceivable,
morally as well as religiously."
<p>All these organisations as well as the Jamaat-e-Islami of Pakistan,
the political mentor of its counterpart by the same name in Kashmir, have
been calling for the expulsion of the Hindus and the Buddhists from Kashmir,
but they had never in the past criticised the Sikhs.
<p>However, there have been indications of tension in the relations between
these organisations and the Sikh community abroad, including in Pakistan,
following the appointment by Mr.Sharif of Lt.Gen. Nasir, who had re-joined
his administration in 1998 as his Intelligence Adviser, as the Chairman
of the Evacuee Trust Property Board and concurrently the President of the
Pakistan Gurudwara Prabandak Committee (PGPC), which is responsible for
the management of all the Sikh gurudwaras in Pakistan, including the Nankana
Sahib of Lahore, one of the holiest of the holy shrines of the Sikhs outside
India and reputedly one of the richest gurudwaras outside India.
<p>All but one of the Sikh members of the PGPC Managing Committee resigned
in protest against the appointment of a Muslim to this post. Since then,
there has been a slanging match between the Sikh leaders of Pakistan and
other countries on the one side and Lt.Gen.Nasir on the other.
<p>Lt.Gen.Nasir has alleged that since 1947 over Rs. One billion from the
funds of the Pakistan-based gurudwaras has been siphoned off to India and
asserted that he would ensure that the collections from foreign Sikh pilgrims
were used only for the maintenance of these gurudwaras in future.
<p>There have also been allegations that the appointment of Lt.Gen.Nasir
was meant to facilitate the diversion of the funds of these gurudwaras
to the Tablighi Jamaat and other Islamic extremist organisations with which
he is associated.
<p>After Lt.Gen. Nasir's criticism of Mr. Sharif's Washington agreement
with President Clinton on the withdrawal of Pakistani troops from the Kargil
area, the latter sacked him as his Intelligence Adviser and as the Chairman
of the Evacuee Trust Property Board, but did not disturb him from his post
as the President of the PGPC. Gen. Musharraf has also retained him in this
post so far.
<p>There is no evidence as yet that these differences might have led to
a change in the attitude of the ISI and the extremist organisations controlled
by it towards the Sikhs in Kashmir.
<p>The massacre of the Sikhs, whatever be the reason, could prove counter-productive
to Pakistan and would only strengthen the perception of Pakistan as a State
whose actions are governed more by irrationality than by reason and logic.
