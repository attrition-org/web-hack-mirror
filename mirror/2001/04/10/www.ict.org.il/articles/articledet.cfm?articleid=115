Policy</I></center>
<p><p><b>Introduction</b>
<br><img SRC="../graphics/symbols4.gif" height=143 width=200 align=RIGHT>Many
researchers and analysts, not to mention reporters and politicians, seem
to view the development of Islamist terrorism over the past decade as a
kind of “new terrorism.” Indeed, the prospects of cooperation between a
variety of Islamist groups and movements seem to have been improved in
the past decade, and particularly in the last two years. There are a number
of reasons for this, of which the fall of the Soviet Union is probably
the most important. The breakup of the USSR was seen through the eyes of
the Islamists as a victory over “the Kingdom of Evil”—a victory that symbolized
a long-range historical phase and a foretaste of the future global victory
of Islam and the Muslims.
<p>Ten years after the success of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the war
against the Soviet Union was seen by the Islamists as the next stage of
the global war between Islam and Western culture. The Iranian Revolution
had itself provided a revolutionary Islamic model for the Sunnis as well
as Shi’ites, even though the Sunni Islamic groups had many reservations
about its content. The fall of the Soviet Union not only symbolized victory,
but also served as a reminder of the existence of a “global conspiracy
against Islam.”
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union the United States remained the sole
force in this conspiracy against Islam. The U.S. is perceived by the Islamists
as the spearhead of Western culture and modernization that threatens the
Islamic world, not necessarily by military force or political colonialism
and influence, but by its cultural influence.
<p>The Islamists saw the fall of the Soviet Union as a direct result of
the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan at the hands of Islamic warriors. The
masses of Arab volunteers recruited to fight the Soviets in the Afghan
conflict later sought to maintain the momentum of victory in other places.
Hence, the Afghan conflict led to the opening of Islamic and Islamist fronts
in various local and national disputes with religious overtones: Bosnia,
Albania, Kosovo, Chechnya, Dagestan and Kashmir. This involvement has led
many observers in recent years to view the phenomenon of “Afghan Arabs”
as a kind of Islamist <i>Internationale</i>, similar in many ways to the
International Brigades of Socialist and Communist volunteers in the civil
war in Spain in the 1930s.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The rise of Islamist Terrorism</font></b></center>

<p>Over the past decade Islamist involvement in terrorism and political
violence in various Arab and Islamic states, as well as in the West or
against Western targets has been on the rise. This trend has gone hand-in-hand
with a trend of increasing destructiveness of terror attacks: the use of
more powerful car bombs, suicide bombings, massacres of innocent civilians
or tourists, and attacks against multi-story buildings in order to cause
massive damages and casualties. This type of terrorism has been used against
both local regimes in the Middle East and Western—mainly American—interests.
<p>Major developments in Islamist terrorism in the past decade include
<ul>
<li>
Islamist terrorism for the first time in the United States, perpetrated
by Egyptian Islamists. In the late 1990s these militants cooperated with
Arab Afghan elements.</li>

<li>
The consolidation of the Jihad Front around Osama bin Ladin’s <i>Al-Qa`idah</i>
organization in Afghanistan. This attracted several small Islamist groups
to join him in order to benefit from his financial aid, the training facilities
in Afghanistan and the hospitality of the Taliban regime. This consolidation
made possible the attacks against American interests in Saudi Arabia, the
bombing of two American embassies in East Africa, and the attempts to carry
out terrorist operations in the U.S. and other places on the occasion of
the Millennium.</li>

<li>
A significant increase in casualties caused by Islamist terrorism. This
can be illustrated by the attacks on the American military base in Khobar,
Saudi Arabia and the two American embassies in East Africa, as well as
the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and
mass killing of tourists in Luxor, Egypt. In the Middle East, high-casualty
attacks included a series of massive suicide bombings by Hamas and the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Israel. Mention should also be made of massacres
of civilians at the hands of Islamists in Algeria. We should add to these
the many similar attempted terrorist attacks that were prevented by the
security services in various countries.</li>

<li>
A shift in focus from religious and nationalist struggles in individual
Arab or Muslim states to the global scope of Islam. This international
perspective has developed gradually throughout the 1990s, and has led to
better organizational ties and cooperation between groups.</li>

<li>
A major increase in fund raising for Islamist organizations and movements,
mainly those indulging in both terrorist and social activity, where it
is sometimes impossible to separate the financing of the various fields
of activity in order to curtail the ability of such groups to “juggle”
the accounts. There has also been an increase in financial support of Arab
and Muslim governments to various Islamic groups or projects in an attempt
to gain control over the Islamists, or alternately to influence, through
them, various sectors of the population.</li>

<li>
It should be noted that the Islamist terrorist activity has taken place
against a background of slow but steady decline in popular support for
some of the Islamist groups, such as GIA (Armed Islamic Group) in Algeria,
The Islamic Jihad and al-Gama`at al-Islamiyyah in Egypt, Hamas in the Palestinian
Authority, and the Jihadi groups in the Yemen. The loss of popular support
is <i>inter alia</i> the result of massive terrorism, which led governments
to apply heavy pressure on large sectors of the population suspected of
being affiliated with Islamist groups or sympathetic towards them.</li>

<li>
An improvement of the ability of Arab Muslim governments to recruit popular
support for their counter-terrorist efforts. In most cases Western—primarily
American—encouragement allowed governments to crack down on Islamist terrorist
groups without the fear of being labeled anti-Islamic.</li>
</ul>
<b>Islam and the West</b>
<br>One important factor has in fact not changed since the beginning of
the Islamist revival in the Arab world in the 1970s: the difficulty of
Muslim populations to cope with modernization and with Western culture.
This has resulted in a rise in the popularity of Islamic and Islamist groups
and individuals among the Muslim communities in the West. This popularity
is due to the rapid growth of these communities by natural growth and immigration
over the past three decades, aided by the development of tension and hatred
of foreigners in many of the host countries, particularly in Europe.
<p>There is a growing sense of insecurity on the part of Muslims living
in Western societies, brought about by social and psychological processes
that led to the return to Islam as a kind of a shield and a source of identity.
A visitor to the Islamic bookstores of London, Paris, New Jersey, or Michigan
would find that most of the religious doctrinal literature sold or distributed
relate to the issues of “How to preserve Muslim life in Western society
and culture.”
<p>These processes increased the quest for an organized religious society,
in which the Islamic organizations play a role in helping communities to
cope with the threat of Western culture—a threat, in the eyes of many Muslims,
to the Muslim mind, soul and cultural values. Similar tensions exist in
the Arab and Muslim world itself and are at the root of the popularity
of the Islamist groups there as well. But in the Western world this sense
of threat has only increased over time.
<p>The fundamentalist, radical messages of modern Islam, the most political
religion on earth, has gained a following among Muslim populations in the
West. In many cases this has occurred with the help of the Western governments
themselves, through their inability or unwillingness differentiate between
social welfare or educational activities and potentially violent political
activities. Western democracies—particularly the more culturally liberal
among them—have thus unwittingly leant themselves to the cause of the Islamists,
for better or worse. For many of the violent Islamist groups, their Islamic
projects, publications and welfare services serve as the backbone of support
for their terrorist activities. Such services aid in recruitment, fund
raising, training, communications, connections within the group and with
other groups, distribution of political, doctrinal, and ideological messages,
publishing pamphlets, assistance from foreign governments, etc. Part of
this activity is sometimes sheltered by a kind of “untouchable” legitimate
organizational complex, in the form of social and welfare associations.
In some countries, particularly in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia, these
organizations benefit from generous financial support from the authorities.
<p>In general, over the past decade the freedom of operation of most of
the Islamist groups has greatly improved outside of their homelands. This
relative freedom did not decrease the basic hostility to the West, particularly
the U.S., but may even have led to increased animosity.
<p><b>Wahhabi-Takfiri Jihad</b>
<br>Under the influence of the “Arab Afghan” phenomenon there has also
been an ideological consolidation of Wahhabi-Takfiri Jihadi ideology and
rhetoric that resulted in two main developments:
<ul>
<li>
A shift in the struggle, mainly through massive terrorism, from the heart
of the Arab World into the “Wild West” of Central Asia and to Western countries
or Western interests in the region.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Better cooperation between various groups and organizations. In the Middle
East examples are Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and to some extent
Hizballah. On the international scene one can see this in the case of the
Egyptian, Pakistani, Kashmiri, Algerian, Jordanian, Yemeni, and Sunni Lebanese
groups.</li>
</ul>
The response of the West under American leadership was to improve international
cooperation in counter-terrorism. However this has not really helped to
confront the recent developments. For most of the past decade cooperation
in
counter-terrorism between the Arab states did not exist, and only during
the past year has such cooperation begun to bear fruit.
<p><b>The development of the Islamist perspective</b>
<br>The Islamist or Jihadi terrorism is an extension of the more radical
aspects of the Islamic revival. This revival was a result of the inability
of Islamic societies to cope with the modernization presented to them by
Western civilization and culture. It was encouraged by regimes unable to
merge Islamic social, political, and cultural perceptions with the “imported”
Western secular culture.
<p>The outcome was the development of a doctrine of Jihad, which offered
a solution to the clash of civilizations. The opposing forces were presented
as Islam, as represented by the movements of the Islamic revival, on the
one hand and the processes of modernization, as represented by Western
culture on the other hand. The incursion of Western culture was perceived
as being aided and abetted by national, royalist, socialist or Marxist
regimes in the Arab and Muslim World.
<p>One of the greatest successes of the Islamist groups was their ability
to present the ideology of this inexorable clash as true and genuine Islam,
and hence to attract relatively large proportions of the Muslim public.
<p>The next stage was the Islamist movements’ attempt to crystallize Muslim
public opinion around the notion that the Muslims are at constant war.
This war is seen as part of an eternal global struggle between Islam and
its adherents and a long string of enemies throughout the history of Islam.
The 20<sup>th</sup> Century gave many Muslims a sense of permanent retreat
in which they were besieged by the threatening Western culture and modernization.
The immediate outcome was secularization and the decline of Islamic political
and social culture as a way of life, as it should have been according to
the Islamic teachings. The superiority of the West gave this war a sense
of desperation, causing it to be presented as a war of self-defense, with
Jihad the only response.
<p>But Jihad does not mean only military conflict. This was a war of cultures,
and therefore it has been conducted mainly for the minds of those Muslims
attracted to the new perceptions. The feeling of being involved in a war
of self-defense led to a sense of being under siege by the both the West
and the secular Arab regimes. Most of the Islamist movements succeeded
in convincing their followers that they were threatened everywhere in the
world. Anyone who reads the collection of Sayyed Qutb’s letters in the
book “America from the inside” (<i>Amrika min al-Dakhil</i>) in the early
1950s(2), can easily trace the origins of the sense of global war that
eventually led to Islamist terrorism, violence, and hatred in the form
of Jihad.
<p>The next stage was the formation of Jihad groups aimed at the creation
of a proud new generation of Islamist warriors, who saw themselves as defenders
of Islam in this global war—a war in which they were persecuted and threatened
from all sides.
<p>One of the questions we should ask ourselves is “who threatens whom?
And who terrorizes whom?” Is the admittedly extant tactical threat of Islamist
terrorism to Western societies greater than the threat of Western modernization
and culture to certain Muslim publics? Was the American intensive assistance
to the Afghan Mujahedin (the former partners of Osama bin Laden) really
meant to save them from the “Evil Empire” of the Soviet Union? If so, then
why not allow them to establish a true Islamic State? Why did the Americans
bombard the Serbs in Kosovo, but totally ignore the Islamists in Chechnya,
who fight the successors of “the Evil Empire”?
<p>The Western mind can find the answers through the logic of political
culture and interests. But, the Islamist political culture, which in Islamic
eyes is an integral part of religious rulings and perceptions, cannot.
<p>And thus we come to the last phase of the development of these Islamist
perceptions. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1990 led many Western societies
to view Islamist terrorism as a new threat to the free world. The result
is that the United States, the leading element of Western civilization,
is on the verge of adopting the Islamic perception of the Global War.
<p>For Muslims, the wars against the Christian Crusaders are the archetype
of the Islamic Jihad—a war on clear religious principles with no distinction
between religion and politics. This perception was revived in the last
decades by all the Islamist movements. When Osama bin Ladin styles his
front “The Front of Jihad against the Crusaders and the Jews” it is obvious
to the entire Muslim world what he means. Furthermore, such a perception
evokes, not only for his immediate followers but also wider Islamic circles,
a vision of a better future in which they emerge victorious.
<p>Bin Ladin’s success in marketing this notion not only lends legitimacy
to terrorism against the West, but also opens the door to the feelings
of hatred rooted in social and economic ills. This closes the circle and
brings us to the roots of the Islamist violence: once again we find the
inability to cope with Western modernization.
<p>The roots of Islamic fundamentalism lie in the search for the glorious
past of Islam in the Middle Ages. The source of the phenomenon lies in
the pursuit of <i>immediate</i> solutions to revive this glorious past.
The continuous sense of retreat during the second half of the past century
led to impatience, which in turn led to violence. The doctrines of the
Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab World or of Maududi’s <i>Jamaah Islamiyyah</i>
in India and the non-Arabic Muslim World have lost their attraction for
part of Islamic societies. Where these traditional doctrines stressed long-range
social revolution, what people seek today is more immediate improvement
in their social conditions. Thus many readily adopted the notion of Jihad
and the clash of civilizations.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>

<p><b><font size=+1>Islamist Terrorism in the 1990s</font></b></center>

<p>This quite long survey of the development of Islamist ideology is essential
for the understanding of what seems to scholars and politicians as the
“new Islamist terrorism” of the 1990s. But there is another element, which
is perhaps the most important of all. The ideology of Jihad became for
many adherents of Islamist movements not only an integral part of the religion,
but the main and sometimes the only part of the religion to follow.
<p>Many members of Islamist groups lack knowledge any clear understanding
of orthodox Islam. As their knowledge of true Islamic doctrine is poor,
they often rely on various Sheikhs and religious scholars, adopting these
leaders’ perceptions of Islam as their own. This gives these leaders and
ideologues great influence over those sectors of the Muslim public whose
knowledge of Islam is even poorer. Thus the version of Islam they offer
their followers is often wholly divorced from religious law, centering
instead on the roots of social and political confrontation.
<p>Another element that brought about the perception of global war was
the vagueness of Islamist goals. Their struggle is not just to liberate
a certain country from foreign occupation or from a “heretic” regime. These
are merely steps along the way in an eternal religious mission, whose victory,
though guaranteed, is to be realized only by future generations. Thus many
of the Islamists lack a clear political world view and hence, any kind
of pragmatism.
<p><b>New Terrorism?</b>
<br>Many researchers and analysts tend to see the violent Islamist phenomenon
as a kind of “new terrorism.” However, what we should ask ourselves is,
do we face a new kind of terrorism, or do we simply lack a basic understanding
of the sources and developments of the “old” terrorism? The conclusion
drawn by at least some scholars is that a great deal of work remains to
be done in order to identify the conditions that cause alienation to erupt
into violence. What is especially important is to trace the links between
religion and extreme forms of violence.
<p>So where then is the new terrorism? What is new in the Islamist terrorism
of the 1990s?
<p>To begin with the so-called new Islamist terrorism is not the result
of the decline of state-sponsored terrorism. Unlike the “secular” national,
radical, anarchist terrorism sponsored by states such as Libya, Syria,
Iraq, Cuba, North Korea, and behind the scenes by the Soviet camp, most
of the Islamist terrorist groups have never been sponsored by states. Most
of the Egyptian Islamist terrorist groups, for example, actually grew independently
out of the internal Egyptian scene. Other than occasional logistic assistance
to some of them on the part of Sudan they were not state-sponsored groups.
The Algerian terrorist groups likewise were not sponsored by foreign states.
<p>Many of these groups neglected social activity, and were thus ineligible
for the very generous financial support rendered to other groups by Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf States. Other groups, notably those of the school of
the Muslim Brotherhood received extensive financial aid for all kinds of
social and welfare projects.
<p>In this sense Hamas is unique, in that it is the only movement of the
Brotherhood that is intensively involved in both terrorism and social activity.
Its terrorism, due to the fact that it is directed only against Israel
and as part of a Palestinian national struggle, gains the support of several
Arab states or wealthy individuals in Arabia, not to mention its social
and welfare infrastructure. But no one calls upon the U.S. State Department
to include those countries in the list of states sponsoring terrorism.
<p>The model of Hamas has been imitated in recent years by Hizballah in
Lebanon, which apart from its guerilla activities against Israel, is also
involved in the social and political strengthening of the Shi`i community
in Lebanon, and is sponsored by Iran under the patronage of Syria.
<p><b>A Geographical Shift</b>
<br>The new phase of Islamist terrorism is actually the shift on the part
of most of the Islamist groups from activities in their own countries against
the secular “heretic” regimes to activities in the global arena. This shift
began with two developments, which though unconnected on the organizational
level, yet share a common ideological basis. The first of these was the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in 1993. The second was the
participation of Islamist volunteers in the conflicts in Bosnia, Albania,
Kosovo, Chechnya, Kashmir, and Dagestan throughout the 1990s.
<p>These two developments seem to point to the establishment of what seems
to be an international or inter-Muslim front in Afghanistan. However this
trend was also the result of the oppression of these groups by the various
Arab regimes, which created a camp of Islamist refugees who could no longer
operate in their homelands. Thus these “Arab Afghans” were forced to take
a new direction, that of global terrorism. This trend toward international
activities was thus not necessarily a conscious decision, but may be more
the result of external factors.
<p><b>Sociological Roots of European Islamism</b>
<br>But there is an older sociological process at work in all this that
seems to have been reinforced in the last decade, and may be even stronger
in the future. In the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century there
was a significant increase in Muslim immigration to the West, mainly to
North America and Western Europe. Whereas the first generation of immigrants
sought to merge into Western society and fought to overcome major economic
difficulties, the expectations of the second and third generation of immigrants
were in many cases unfulfilled. This has reinforced their alienation from
the Western societies that surrounded them.
<p>Although in many countries, primarily the UK, Scandinavia, and Germany,
the immigrants were granted generous economic support, and benefited from
total freedom of organization, speech and education, their own communities
were built mainly through the generosity of the wealthier Muslim countries.
<p>The xenophobia of the surrounding societies, coupled with unemployment
and the difficulty in coping with modernization, led to the growth of an
Islamic infrastructure, which in the liberal atmosphere of Western democracies
could serve as a hothouse for Islamist movements. Social associations in
London or research foundations in the United States, can, for example serve
as the logistic foundation of Islamist terrorist groups. Such activities
as recruiting, fund raising, publication and distribution of messages can
all be done under the cover of social and cultural activities.
<p>This tends to reinforce the globalization and internationalization of
Islamist terrorism, and will most likely continue to do so in the future.
The growing feeling of alienation of Muslim youngsters is perhaps the most
important factor in analyzing the prospects of future Islamist terrorism.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>The answer to this phenomenon deserves a separate article. But part
of it lies in a better understanding on the part of the Western world of
the roots of Islamist violence. The steps taken by Western countries, under
the leadership of the United States—steps such as increased cooperation
in the field of intelligence, new legislation, encouragement of counter-terrorism
by Arab and Muslim states, extradition of wanted terrorists—are all very
important. But they provide no solution to the root cause of this phenomenon.
This is especially true so long as Western countries, as represented by
their media, politicians, and cultural leaders seem so ready to adopt the
Islamist perception of the clash of civilizations between Islam and Western
culture. In so doing they assist the Islamist terrorism to become a strategic
global issue. By building up the image of an Islam at war with the West,
they play into the hands of the Islamists.
<p>An additional element should be borne in mind, and is often neglected
by scholars dealing with the Islamist phenomenon. This is the existence
of elements of dissension, personality conflicts and rivalry that have
so far prevented the growth of Islamist terrorist groups beyond the current
level.
<p>At present the “Islamist <i>Internationale</i>,” such as it is, has
several thousand hard core members and some ten thousand sympathizers,
supporters and fund raising activists. However, Osama Bin Ladin is nowhere
near to being the new Islamic <i>Khalifah</i> and has little prospects
of being proclaimed as such. And while it is true that there is an increase
in international cooperation between different groups, and even a consolidation
of a new version of Wahhabi-Takfiri ideology that helps to unite some of
these groups, we cannot say that there is an Islamist <i>Internationale</i>
ready to unite into a global movement and become a global strategic threat.
