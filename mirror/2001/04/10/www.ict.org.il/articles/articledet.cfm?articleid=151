<P><p>WAS THE CEASEFIRE DECISION WISE?
<p>Yes, it was and still is, but as a prelude to inducing the genuinely
Kashmiri organisations to enter into a dialogue with the Government of
India, but, unfortunately, its subsequent public projection has made it
appear as a gesture to Pakistan and as a prelude to the resumption of a
dialogue with Pakistan. The military leadership in Pakistan does not appreciate
such gestures. Instead, it views them as signs that India is blinking and
that Pakistan's policy has started paying dividends.
<p>WHAT IS THE GROUND REALITY IN J &amp; K?
<p>The ground reality in J &amp; K is that the Army of the State of Pakistan
has been using the Army of Islam of the Afghan war vintage, consisting
of Pakistani groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen
(HUM), and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) formed by Maulana Masood Azhar, formerly
of the HuM, and of the former East Pakistan vintage such as the Al Badr,
to make India bleed and achieve its objectives. These are not pro-Pakistan
Kashmiri organisations. These are, pure and simple, Pakistani organisations,
consisting of and led by Pakistani nationals, many of whose office-bearers
are Punjabis or Pakhtuns and not even Kashmiris of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir
(POK), based in and operating from Pakistani territory and funded and armed
by the Army of the State through Islamic organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islami
(JEI), the Jamaat-ul-Ulema Pakistan (JUI) etc and through retired heads
of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) such as Lt.Gen.Hamid Gul and Lt.Gen.Javed
Nasir. These organisations' target is not just J &amp; K, but the whole
of India. Their objective is not just acquisition of J &amp; K, but the
Pakistanisation of India, by fighting for two more so-called homelands
for the Muslims of North and South India. The Army of Islam provides the
Army of the State with an alibi to deny its involvement to global opinion.
What we are facing in J &amp; K and other parts of India is not just militancy
and/or terrorism, but a covert war waged by the Army of the State of Pakistan
against the Indian State through this Army of Islam. By describing these
organisations as pro-Pakistan organisations and not Pakistani organisations,
we are playing into the hands of the Army of Islam and Pakistan by giving
this foreign Army a locus standi in J &amp; K, which it does not and should
not have.
<p>WHAT IS THE POSITION REGARDING THE KASHMIRI MILITANT ORGANISATIONS?
<p>The genuinely indigenous Kashmiri militant organisations form into two
groups-- the pro-independence group consisting of organisations such as
the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the pro-Pakistan group, consisting
of organisations such as the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), the militant wing
of the JEI, J &amp; K. Since the middle 1990s, the pro-Independence group
has been mainly active politically and not so much on the ground. The HM
too has been marginalised by the Pakistani Army of Islam. Whereas the LeT
claims responsibility for its operations, the HUM does not. Instead, the
HUM lets the HM claim the responsibility, in order to make it appear to
the outside world that the fighting is being done by indigenous Kashmiri
organisations, and not by Pakistani ones and to project the HM as the leader
of the jihad in J &amp; K. This was clearly brought out by Mr.Kamran Khan,
the Pakistani investigative journalist, in a report on the HUM based on
interviews with HUM activists in 1995. We should not let ourselves be manipulated
by Pakistan into according to the HM, in our public projections, an importance
it does not have or deserve, as the most important indigenous Kashmiri
organisation.
<p>WHAT IS THE POSITION OF GEN.PERVEZ MUSHARRAF VIS-&Agrave;&Agrave;-VIS
THE ARMY OF ISLAM AND ITS PATRON OSAMA BIN LADEN
<p>Deliberately ambivalent.
<ul>
<li>
He has not taken any action against the HUM, despite its being declared
by the US as an international terrorist organisation in October, 1997.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
He has resisted US pressure to co-operate in tracing and arresting the
hijackers of the IAC aircraft to Kandahar in December, 1999.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
He reportedly promised to President Clinton in March last year that he
would himself meet the Amir of the Taliban, Mulla Mohammed Omar, in Kandahar
and persuade him to moderate the Taliban's policies and co-operate with
the US on the bin Laden issue, but has not done so.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
He launched with fanfare last year a programme for the deweaponisation
of Pakistani society, but, subsequently, slowed down its implementation
under pressure from the Army of Islam.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
His Interior Minister, Lt.Gen. (retd) Moinuddin Haider, announced a plan
for the documentation of the madrasas and for greater government control
over their curriculum, but the implementation of this too has been slowed
down under similar pressure.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Under US pressure, he initially imposed restrictions on the movements of
Maulana Masood Azhar, but subsequently relaxed them and allowed the Jaish-e-Mohammed
to operate freely from Pakistani territory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Previous Pakistani rulers covertly supported the jihad of the Army of Islam
against India, but he is the first Pakistani ruler to have openly justified
the Jihad.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
He initially imposed restrictions on public displays by the constitutents
of the Army of Islam, but has subsequently relaxed them.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
He has consciously refrained from criticising the activities of the Army
of Islam. After every act of terrorism, the LeT has been holding a press
conference in Pakistani territory or issuing a press statement in Pakistani
territory to claim responsibility for the attack. He has never tried to
condemn the LeT.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
A statement issued by the Pakistan Foreign Office on January 15,2000, after
the meeting of Shri Vijay Nambiar, the Indian High Commissioner, with Gen.Musharraf
said: "The commencement of the dialogue would bring about improvement in
the prevailing environment."&nbsp; In other words, any Pakistani instructions
to the Army of Islam to desist from acts of terrorism would be conditional
on the beginning of the dialogue and its making progress to the satisfaction
of Pakistan and the Army of Islam.</li>
</ul>
WHY IS GEN.MUSHARRAF UNWILLING TO REIN IN THE ARMY OF ISLAM?
<p>Gen.Musharraf, Maj.Gen. (retd) Mahmud Durrani, Lt.Gen. (retd) Hamid
Gul and Lt.Gen. (retd) Javed Nasir were amongst those who godfathered this
Army of Islam, initially for use against the erstwhile USSR at US instance
and now against India. In their perception, this Army of Islam seems to
be producing results against India as it did against the USSR and the Najibullah
Government of Afghanistan. Why should they rein it in when Pakistan has
not been made to pay dearly for its actions? Moreover, he has given clear
evidence of being amenable to pressure from the Islamic extremist organisations
and their supporters in the Army.
<p>IS THE PAKISTAN ARMY IN A POSITION TO REIN IT IN, IF IT WANTS TO? WHAT
IS ITS DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER IT?
<p>He is cleverly trying to create an impression that it has limited control
over it. This is not so. The tapes of the conversations of Lt.Gen.Mohammed
Aziz, the then Chief of the General Staff (CGS), with Gen.Musharraf, then
on a visit to Beijing, in May, 1999, provide ample proof of this. During
the conversation, Lt.Gen.Aziz told Gen.Musharraf: "The scruff of their
neck (the Army of Islam's) is in our hands; whenever you want, we could
regulate it."
<p>POINTS TO BE KEPT IN VIEW
<ul>
<li>
To project the cease-fire as a gesture to the people of J &amp; K in order
to pave the way for a political process and not as a gesture to Pakistan
to pave the way for a bilateral dialogue.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If the cease-fire is further extended, to make it clear that it only applies
to the indigenous Kashmiri organisations, consisting of Indian citizens,
which have taken to arms against the Govt. of India and not to the Pakistani
Army of Islam, which has been waging a war against the Indian State on
behalf of the Pakistan State Army.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To make a clear distinction between the dialogue with the Kashmiri organisations
on the future political dispensation of the State and with Pakistan on
its claims to Indian territory in J &amp; K.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To make it equally clear that Pakistan has no locus standi in the dialogue
between the Government of India and the Kashmiri organisations and that,
similarly, the Kashmiri organisations have no locus standi in any dialogue
of the Indian State with the State of Pakistan.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To emphasise that while the Government of India is willing to have talks
with the Govt. of Pakistan on the nuclear confidence-building issues at
any time at the appropriate level, any talks on the Kashmir issue would
continue to be dependent on Pakistan pulling back its Army of Islam from
Indian territory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To avoid inviting Gen. Musharraf to New Delhi since the invitation could
be exploited by him to further strengthen his position by projecting to
the Army and the people that his policy is succeeding.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To ensure consistency in our policies and public projections. If we project
Pakistan one day as a State Sponsor of International Terrorism and the
next day as a State positively responding to India, the world will stop
taking seriously our strong case against Pakistan. Re-opening the dialogue
process with Pakistan does not mean facilitating Pakistan coming out of
the dog house into which it has been consigned by international opinion.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To avoid giving a certificate of good conduct to Pakistan through unwise
public statements.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To ensure that we do not let ourselves be manipulated by Pakistan and its
Army of Islam to undermine the position of Dr.Farooq Abdullah, the Chief
Minister of J &amp; K, and other mainstream Kashmiri leaders to the benefit
of the HM and other pro-Pakistan leaders.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To avoid too many public statements and to keep Pakistan and its Army of
Islam guessing as to our next move. Proper public projection of our policies
and actions is as important, if not more important, than the actions themselves.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Never to forget the fact that like Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto and Gen.Zia-ul-Haq
and many other Pakistani leaders, civilian and military, Gen.Musharraf
is a master practitioner of the art of dissimulation, which comes naturally
to him.</li>
