<P>The American administration has set itself up as an enemy and a judge
at the same time, when they deal with terrorism, and decide for themselves
what is "International Terrorism". The annual report of the State Department
this year is no different from the previous one except for some statistic
data here and there. The U.S. is the only country which boasts of its power
to counter terrorism wherever it may act on this Earth, from Colombia in
the West to Japan in the East. But, at the same time they want to drag
the whole world into a swamp of violence while claiming to fight it.

<P>From the report of the American State Department on International Terrorism
and the list of states sponsoring terrorism, it is clear that they point
to certain countries that challenge American policy, four of them Arab
states. Another consistent contrivance is the labeling of some groups as
terrorist organizations, as revenge and, worse yet, for Zionist exploitation.

<P>The U.S. appointed itself judge and inspector of human rights, freedom
of opportunities and democracy over the Globe, even if it harms the rights
and freedom of its own citizens, tramples its Constitution with Zionist
shoes, and even nurtures the worst and most oppressive regimes, for example
Israel.

<P>Two years ago, the American Congress passed a law to fight so-called
Terrorism. This law included some articles that several American scholars
saw as contradicting the constitutional rights of American citizens. Among
them, for example, was the right of the American Government to use so-called
secret evidence in order to detain a citizen for eighteen months without
a trial; or exile him from the U.S. just for suspicion of contacts with
a group considered by the Administration to be a terrorist group. The accused
and even his lawyers are not allowed to see the secret evidence, which
is presented to the judge only by the Attorney General. The American Authorities
can also freeze the bank accounts of local groups or individuals if they
are connected to any “terrorist“ foreign organization.

<P>This law, which was presented after the explosion in the Federal Building
in Oklahoma City on April 1995, has been implemented till now only on Palestinian
Arabs. This proves that the Zionist Lobby stands behind this law, although
the accused in that explosion belong to an extremist American group which
had no connection to any “terrorist” Middle Eastern group.

<P>The American authorities have detained till now three Palestinian Islamic
activists who carry American citizenship, without presenting them with
any definite accusations. They are only suspected of having been engaged
in Islamic activity, which the American Administration had called “terrorist”.
The three - Dr. Mazen al-Najjar, Dr. Abd al- Halim Ashkar and Ismail al-Bar`asi
- are Islamists who deal voluntarily with welfare in the U.S. and Palestine.

<P>It is clear that the American authorities, under the pressure of the
Jewish-Zionist Lobby, fight the Islamic activity in the U.S. and especially
the one dedicated to serve the Palestinian people socially and culturally.
They do this under a claim, which so far they have failed to prove, that
American finance goes to Hamas and other Palestinian organizations in the
Territories through foundations for Islamic activity in the U.S.

<P>This attack comes while Islam is spreading in the American society and
many are converting to Islam. Statistics shows that more than 200 thousand
American prisoners have converted to Islam in American jails during the
past ten years, due to the activity of Islamic preachers. This activity
is approved and even encouraged by the American prison authorities themselves,
after they had seen that most of the Muslim ex-prisoners did not return
to jail and Islam induced them to mend their ways. It even brought the
administration of the American prisons to appoint several Muslim Imams
to take care of the Muslim prisoners.

<P>The Muslim society in America is a peaceful one, in contrast to the
Jews and some of other parts of society there. American statistics shows
that against every Muslim accused of criminal activity in the U.S. there
are six accused Jews, although the number of Muslims in the U.S. is larger
than the number of Jews. Dr. al-Ashkar has continued his hunger strike
for about three months now, in protest of his detention because of his
refusal to testify about the Islamic activity in the U.S. before the court
of justice of South New York, where the Jewish influence is a known fact.
This is a disgrace for American justice. Dr. al-Ashkar and his colleague
Isma`il al-Bar`asi used their constitutional right of silence and refused
to testify before the “Jewish” court. Dr. al-Ashkar denied all the temptations
of the American authorities including the promise to appoint him as Minister
in the Palestinian Autonomy (!)

<P>The Zionist Lobby opened this campaign against the Muslims, the Arabs
and particularly the Palestinians in 1993. It was extended by the arrest
of the former head of the politburo of Hamas, Dr. Musa Abu Marzuk in 1995,
although he had not violated any American law during his stay in the U.S.
This campaign has showed it true colors by the arrest of the three Palestinians
who worked in relief associations. This campaign tries to terrorize the
Islamic activity and frighten the Muslim Diaspora from any cooperation
or assistance to these associations thus, drying up the sources of its
projects, which attempt to promote the Islamic message in an American society
thirsty for its message.

<P>Dr. Abd al-Halim al-Ashkar, 40, the founder and manager of the al-Aqsa
Foundation for Education, which assists Palestinian educational institutions
in the Occupied Territories, has been going on a hunger strike for three
months now, and his health situation has badly deteriorated. He is hospitalized
at the prison hospital and is getting his food through the vein of his
neck, after the failure to feed him through the veins of his hands, what
adds his suffering. Dr. al-Ashkar was arrested on February 23, because
he refused to testify before an American jurist committee, which investigated
the Islamist activity in the U.S., and the court regarded this refusal
as contempt of court.

<P>Mr. Isma`il al-Bar`asi, 51, is one of the founders of the Islamic Union
of Palestine. He was arrested on April 6, after he had refused to testify
before a Grand Jury in New York. He was called to testify on assisting
educational societies in Occupied Palestine. His name was involved in a
common bank account with Dr. Musa Abu Marzuk while the last was staying
in the U.S. and before he was appointed chairman of the Politburo of Hamas.

<P>Dr. Abd al-Halim al-Ashkar and Mr. Isma`il al-Bar`asi, and Dr. Musa
Abu Marzuk and Dr. Mazen al-Najjar before them are a proof of the fantasies
of American Justice and its bias towards the Zionist enemy. The so-called
Counter-Terrorism Law is actually dedicated to fight the Islamic activity
in the U.S. and particularly the assisting activity to the Palestinian
people.

<P>Hamas activists continue to feign innocence in regard to their activity
in the U.S. They refuse to admit that their activity there is a combination
of political and cultural activity, which creates not only a social infrastructure
but a framework for terrorism as well. They, and other groups, act on the
ground that there is no Islamic radical political or social activity without
the element of the "armed struggle", which is expressed in terrorist activities--Jihad
as a outgrowth of the various dimensions of their activity: social, cultural,
political, military, economic etc. This point of view is not unique to
Hamas. On November 1995, after the assassination of Dr. Fathi Shqaqi, the
General secretary of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, his appointed successor
was Dr. Ramadan Abdallah Shalah, a scholar who had operated for a few years
in Miami in varioIslamic activities.

<P>The U.S., as well as some countries in Europe, are used as favorite
centers for the activities of Islamic radical groups, in order to assist
their colleagues in the Arab World. The Islamists enjoy in the West full
freedom of speech and activity, as long as they do not engage in activities
hostile to the host countries. This freedom enables the Islamists to raise
financial support, distribute their written material and publications,
develop research institutes etc. under the democratic umbrella of the West.

<P>The American law of 1995 against terrorism is therefore an excellent
example of how to really fight the various kinds of terrorism. It should
also be a ground for better co-operation between Western countries, not
against Islam or Islamic activity but against the type of radical Islamist
who uses the democratic hospitality of Western countries to promote issues
that ultimately serve terrorism.

<P>
