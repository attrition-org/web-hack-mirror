<p><b>Introduction</b>
<p>Among the most dynamic of all the political extremes now is the Far
Right. In the US, the growth of white supremacist groups, militias and
so-called Christian fundamentalists has lead to a belated recognition that
domestic extremism poses great dangers. In Germany, neo-Nazi groups incite
violence against foreign workers and asylum seekers, and official assessments
suggest that they continue to pose a danger to the safety of citizens and
the security of the state. As in the US, the trend in Germany since the
1980’s has been for small groups to act out their campaigns on single issues,
often coordinating their activities, but seldom seeking to come together
to form larger groups with a political agenda.
<p>British Far Right groups have achieved far less impact than elsewhere
in Europe and America. Their support base, as expressed in votes at elections,
is narrower and the size of the groups is very much smaller. However they
too incite violence, and have even been responsible for acts of terrorism.
<p>Common to many Far Right groups is a developing bond of ideological
opposition to central government and its policies, to non-white residency
and to the development of transnational contacts. In these respects the
new Right differs from older, particularly wartime, models of fascism and
neo-Nazism. New contacts and evolving ideologies are being facilitated
and enhanced by information and communication technologies (ict’s).
<p>Noted commentators have remarked on this employment of new cultural
mechanisms and technologies to disseminate neo-Nazi ideas. They suggest
that what is being produced is a globalized racist and neo-fascist movement
and culture that draws on international electronic networks, whilst simultaneously
reinforcing old xenophobic ideas embodied in traditional racism and anti-Semitism.
They further suggest that a new virtual racism has evolved through the
medium of the Internet, that the interpenetration of various nationalist
movements is amplified within cyberspace, and that it is possible for Far
Right groups of markedly different types to establish common networks and
ideological alliances, particularly around a shared common enemy. (Back,
Keith and Solomos 1996, 1998; Eatwell 1996).
<p>It is this tendency to use cyberspace as a means to communicate, and
to a lesser extent to effect command and control, the dangers that arise
therefrom and the legal sanctions used to combat these developments that
are the subject of this chapter.
<p><b>Current Internet Usage</b>
<p>The militia movement in the USA is now deemed a potent threat to the
authority of central government. According to Ken Stern, the use of ict’s
was one of the major reasons the militia movement expanded faster than
any hate group in history. Its lack of an organized center and its geographical
spread across the whole country was more than made up for by the communication
and rumor-mongering potential of the new medium. It meant that a militia
member in a remote state such as Idaho or Montana could be part of an entire
nationwide network.
<p>The most important of the new technologies was the Internet, followed
by fax networks and talk radio. Stern cites the short-wave radio stations
WWCR in Nashville, WRNO in New Orleans, WHRI in South Bend Indiana and
others that regularly broadcast racist and anti-government conspiracy theory
programs. It was on WWCR (World Wide Christian Radio) that a broadcaster
gave instructions on how to build bombs with materials from local stores
from 1994 onwards and which the Federal Communications Commission was subsequently
reported to be investigating for a possible link with Timothy McVeigh and
the Oklahoma City bombing. (Stern 1998: p224)
<p>Fax machines are useful for disseminating messages, but they are not
interactive. Therefore it is the Internet which has been the main means
of communication for the American Far Right. Stern noted that there were
up to 300 such systems serving the Far Right in America in 1997, but since
then other estimates have run much higher, including that of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, which now cites, 600 ‘hate’ sites. Among
these it has identified 35, mostly US-based sites, run by militia groups
advocating armed struggle, 94 sites that sought to establish a racial hierarchy,
87 neo-Nazi sites, 35 White Supremacist sites, and 51 sites openly advocating
terrorism. However it also found that some of the most extreme groups have
placed their sites outside of the United States, in order to escape legal
jurisdiction.[1]
<p>Initially it was bulletin board services, including PatriotNet, LibertyNet,
PaulRevereNet, which allowed the interconnectivity across great distances.
Linda Thompson, a militia leader, stated that her bulletin board reaches
36,000 people.
<blockquote>We are a news service. We use the computer as the end of the
line, not the beginning. We get information in by Federal Express, faxes
and phone, then we put it on the bulletin boards for the widest distribution.</blockquote>
Thompson also stated that some of their messages were encrypted using Pretty
Good Privacy.
<blockquote>To confuse people who may be listening in ... We send copies
of the Constitution out encrypted, just to keep ‘em (the CIA) busy.[2]</blockquote>
Dan Gannon established the first Far Right hate site in Portand, Oregon,
in December 1991, but from the mid-1990’s onwards computers and computer
services became cheaper, quicker and more readily available and these developments
coincided with the birth of the militia movement. While bulletin boards
had provided communication and a degree of control and security, the Internet
news groups allow greater speed and audience. Newsgroups such as alt.conspiracy
and talk.politics.guns allowed members of the militias to share information,
advice, and paranoia.
<p>The militias owe much of their doctrine to the white supremacists and
neo-Nazis. During the mid-1980’s Louis Beam, a leader of the white supremacist
group Aryan Nations, operated a computer network. He used it to issue a
hit list which proposed the assassination of politicians, judges, FBI agents,
federal marshals and even the President himself. In 1992 he published Leaderless
Resistance, which defined the modern Far Right in America, and increasingly
elsewhere. His particular doctrine downplays hierarchy in favor of a network
of ‘phantom cells’. Such cells communicate covertly in a networked format
allowing offensive flexibility while protecting the security of the organization
as a whole.
<blockquote>Utilizing the leaderless resistance concept, all individuals
in groups operate independently of each other, and never report to a central
headquarters or single leader for directional instruction … Participants
in a program of leaderless resistance through phantom cell or individual
action must know exactly what they are doing and exactly how to do it …
All members of phantom cells or individuals would tend to react to objective
events in the same way through usual tactics of resistance. Organs of information
distribution such as newsletters, leaflets, computers etc which are widely
available to all, keep each person informed of events allowing for a planned
response that will take on many variations. No one need issue an order
to anyone.[3]</blockquote>
German neo-Nazis were the first to use the Internet in this way. They have
been communicating with one another, and organizing their activities, via
the ThuleNetz (Network) since the 1980’s.
<blockquote>Provided with passwords such as ‘Germania’ or ‘Endsieg’ (Final
Victory) from a post office box, personal computer screens will display
a calendar of forthcoming neo-Nazi events and list contact numbers of leading
right-wingers … On Remembrance Sunday, police saw in action for the first
time, computer planned coordinated neo-Nazi action, involving the widespread
use of secret codes and radio communication … “The advantof electronic
mailboxes is that they are free of censorship and bugproof” said Karl-Heinz
Sendbuhler of the National Democratic Party.[4]</blockquote>
The German authorities express increasing concern over the Internet. They
have noted the growth of Far Right home pages, from 30 in 1996 to 90 in
1997 and the manner in which football hooligans were mobilized during the
1998 football World Cup series by German Nazis via their websites.[5]
<p>British neo-Nazis adopted the use of ict’s later than their counterparts
in other countries. Although smaller in size, less sophisticated and certainly
less violent, they are nevertheless now willing to take on new ideas and
technologies. The writer of the National Front journal, The Nationalist,
recently discussed the benefits that information and communication technologies
were bringing to the group:
<blockquote>All over the world anyone with access to the Internet can find
a full range of information regarding the National Front at the touch of
a button ... New friends from around the world have been made and important
contacts have been established, particularly in the United States, where
we regularly liaise via E-mail with a major nationalist organisation, with
a possible view to future long-term co-operation. The Internet will be
the main political campaigning tool of the next decade and beyond.[6]</blockquote>
The British National Party has also caught up with cyberspace and aims
to use it extensively in the future. Its Internet Conference Weekend, held
at the end of March 1999, was designed to help a small number of activists
make their plans for a dedicated Euro-Campaign Website, and to discuss
electronic political outreach work. Also on the agenda were plans for the
exchange of expertise, research and development for a Virtual Headquarters
idea, and merchandising plans.[7]
<p>Even the much smaller National Revolutionary Faction, a descendant of
the National Front, announced recently:
<blockquote>The new home page has put us in touch with an increasing number
of National Revolutionary activists worldwide. If you have access to a
computer, then why not check it out for yourself at: http//www.geocities.com/Athens/Troy/8854.[8]</blockquote>
A recent development has been the transnational cyberspace information
bulletin, having no real national affiliation. The International Third
Position’s Final Conflict E-mail appears to be moving in this direction,
with its increasing number of postings from Far Right groups around the
world, but the Western Imperative Network (WIN) claims to be truly international.
Its Mission Statement states that:
<blockquote>The Western Imperative Network is a cyberspace organization
consisting of concerned White Men and Women who are dedicated to the essential
urgent missions of educating our fellow Whites on racial issues and fighting
anti-White attitudes, ideas and propaganda on the Internet …WIN activists
use the Internet to educate as to the problems and dangers we face as a
people ... The second main directive of the Western Imperative Network
is to actively oppose anti-White propagandists of whatever race operating
on the Internet (typically on the usernet) … if you are a White man or
woman, have a computer and Internet account, a few hours per week, are
ready to do your part in the White separatist struggle, have read the WINFAQ
and agree with the goals and guidelines described therein, then contact
us. WIN is always active fighting anti-White activities and attitudes on
the net.[9]</blockquote>

<p><br><b>How Threatening is the Far Right’s Internet Usage?</b>
<p>What particular dangers arise from the Far Right’s use of ict’s, and
are these dangers new or additional ones. It would seem that they are.
First, they allow interconnectivity, that is the power to communicate and
network that previously were not available to them in such an easy manner
and with such speed.
<p>An example of this were the warnings given on the Internet to supporters
after the simultaneous raids in America and Canada on the offices of Resistance
Records, the leading producers of white supremacist and skinhead music
and tapes, and the home of George Burdy, its founder.[10] A second example
was when the killing, in Essex in February 1997, of Combat 18 member Christopher
Castle by two of the group’s leaders, was posted on the Internet site of
the American National Socialist White People’s Party within 12 hours.[11]
<p>In early 1999, Final Conflict E-mail, the website of the International
Third Position, a small British national revolutionary group, advertised
an anti-European Union demonstration that was to have taken place in Rome
in April. Few other adverts were seen for this in hard copy format, and
it may therefore be assumed that the bulk of the advertising was carried
out over the Net. (However they also subsequently published news of the
demonstration’s ban by the Italian police.)[12]
<p>Second, the Internet allows covert communication and anonymity. Milton
John Kleim Jnr, the former self-styled ‘Net Nazi Number One’ wrote of these
powers, before he renounced his Nazi views:
<blockquote>All my comrades and I, none of whom I have ever met face to
face, share a unique camaraderie, feeling as though we have been friends
for a long time. Self-less co-operation occurs regularly amongst my comrades
for a variety of endeavors. This feeling of comradeship is irrespective
of national identity or state borders.[13]</blockquote>
A third reason for using the Internet is that it is cheap. For the price
of a computer and a modem an extremist can become a player in national
and world events. Ict’s lower the threshold for participating in illegal
acts, and without state or other backing extremists will look for cost
effective instruments. A consequence of this is that presentation and quality
may vary widely. At one end of the spectrum there are professional-quality
sites such as Stormfront and RadioIslam, with coloured graphics, photographs
and links to other similar sites, which are the equal of the best available
produced by large organisations. At the other end of the spectrum are the
poorly presented, often barely literate, hate sheets such as the Norwegian
Julius Streiker’s site or some of the messages on the bulletin boards and
the news groups. The British National Party’s Internet television site
commenced transmission in early 1999, and represents the next generation
and future direction for groups which seek to hide their hate messages
in sophisticated packaging. What is common to all is the fact that they
are produced with few resources, often by single persons, or very small
teams, yet present a facade of authenticity to the innocent reader, despite
their origins.
<p>Four, ict’s act as a force-multiplier, enhancing power and enabling
extremists to punch above their weight. They can now have a reach and influence
that was previously denied them. Communication technology represents, in
many respects, the ‘death of distance’ and the national borders that once
separated the extremists from the objects of their hatred have ceased to
exist. The British National Front summarised these opportunities in a recent
issue of their journal The Nationalist:
<blockquote>GREAT OPPORUNITY … The Internet will be the main political
campaigning tool of the next decade and beyond. We have tested the technology
with our audio broadcasts and it is entirely suitable for substantial investment,
both in terms of time and money. Some people might think that the National
Front Internet presence is not at all important and that funds should only
be channelled into it after everything else has been paid for. Such a few
represents a dangerous underestimation of the significance of the Internet
and the great opportunities that it presents us with admittedly, many people
do not own a computer with which to view our site at present, but all that
will change with the advent of the digital revolution which will begin
to sweep this country at the end of the year … we have the opportunity
to reach millions of people with our message over the next few months,
but we must invest now and have the infrastructure in place in order to
take full advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves in
the near futur.[14]</blockquote>
The Australian symposium on Holocaust denial organized by Frederick Toben’s
AInstitute in the summer of 1998 was attended by a number of Nazi sympathisers
and deniers. Some would-be participants however were precluded from attending
by the distance and expense involved; others were banned from entering
Australia by the authorities. However, those unable to attend were still
able to participate by posting their presentations over the Internet or
by the use of video links.
<p>Fifth, ict’s enable extremists to reach their target audience when other
outlets and media are denied them, and to reach new audiences, particularly
the young and educated. In several European countries, their hate-filled
postings would almost certainly be prosecuted if published in hardcopy;
the absence of specific sanctions, or protocols on the Internet has allowed
the postings, so far. It has enabled the Far Right to reach across national
boundaries and by-pass laws banning hate material, as in Britain, France,
Germany and Scandinavia and has therefore become a priority from the point
of view of their doctrine. Again it was Louis Beam who first pointed out
these possibilities, as well as the barriers that law enforcement was likely
to place in their way:
<blockquote>The Internet, perhaps the last truly free means of information
exchange in the Western world, may soon be choked by censorship and governmental
controls. The circumscribing of the Net may cause the death of what has
become the first people-to-people exchange of ideas and information on
a worldwide basis … at stake is nothing less than the regaining of information
control which the Internet has shattered. Up for grabs is nothing more
than the thinking and decision-making abilities of informed men. Information
has flowed from the top down for most of this century. Filtering of information
by middlemen from government, newspapers, radio and then television has
led most Americans depending upon Paul Harvey “for the rest of the story”.
Suddenly, almost without warning, the Internet mushroomed into popularity,
connecting people all over the world together electronically and thereby
threatening the power of those who can disseminate information.[15]</blockquote>
Some activists have sought to avoid legal prescription by moving their
sites abroad to put them beyond their own countries’ laws. Thus the British
National Party now has a site registered in Tonga, the French Charlemagne
Hammerskins moved their site to Canada following the termination of their
service by America Online in September 1997 and Ernst Zundel, a German
national residing in Canada, has his site registered in California.
<p>The Net strategy of Milton Kleim defined the Far Right’s approach:
<blockquote>The State cannot yet stop us from ‘advertising’ our ideas and
organizations on USERNET, but I can assure you this will not always be
the case. NOW is the time to grasp the WEAPON which is the NET, and wield
it skilfully and wisely while you may still do so freely … Crucial to our
USERNET campaign is that our message is disseminated beyond “our” groups:
we MUST move out beyond our present domain and take up positions on “mainstream
groups” … Remember our overall USERNET strategy must be to repeat powerful
themes OVER AND OVER AND OVER. We cannot compete with the Jews’ media,
of course, as our propaganda dissemination is but a very small fraction
of the everywhere pervasive leftist propaganda. However, our ideas possess
an energy that truth alone contains.[16]</blockquote>

<p><br><b>Effective Policing</b>
<p>Growing international concern is prompting governments to police the
Net and take to legal action against those who post offensive and illegal
hate material on the Internet. Two major issues arise however in their
approach to these problems. They must balance the right of free expression
with the protection of human dignity; and they must determine under whose
jurisdiction any offence has been committed.
<p>However any national response will necessarily be based, in part, upon
the main international legal instruments signed by governments.
<p>In 1965 the United Nations adopted the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is the oldest and
most widely ratified UN human rights convention and defines racial discrimination
as ‘any distinction, exclusion, or restriction or preference based on race,
color, dissent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect
of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an
equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political,
economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life’.
<p>States ratifying the Convention are obliged to adopt legal measures
for eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations
and preventing and combating racist doctrines and practices. They are expected
to make all dissemination of such ideas based on racial superiority or
hatred, and incitement to racial discrimination, an offence punishable
by law, and are required to take effective measures to review policies
in order to amend laws and regulations which might have the effect of creating
or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists. It is generally
agreed that these requirements are applicable to hate-oriented groups using
the Internet to disseminate their propaganda.
<p>In August 1996 the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,
which was created to ensure that governments fulfil their obligations under
the Convention, noted the growing trend among racist organizations to use
electronic mail or the Internet to spread racist or xenophobic propaganda,
and that no national legislation had power over this world-wide network.
A seminar on the Internet and Racial Discrimination held by the Committee
in November 1997 noted with great concern that the Internet plays an increasing
role in disseminating hate speech and racial discrimination world-wide.
Although it failed to reach a consensus on a number of contentious issues
it did recommend that member states continue in their efforts to establish
international legal measures in compliance with their obligations under
international law. More effective action has foundered however on the resistance
of some countries, particularly the USA, to impose any barriers to free
speech.[18]
<p>In Europe more concrete goals are possible through the European Union
institutions, and there has been considerable effort to develop a regulatory
framework, and the enactment of legal instruments, in recent years. In
October 1996 the European Commission adopted the Communication on Harmful
and Illegal Content on the Internet which set out proposals for immediate
action against such material. The Communication concluded that it was the
responsibility of the member states to ensure that existing laws apply
to the Internet and that co-operation and co-ordination at a European and
international level should assist the enforcement of the laws. It recommended
a regulatory framework combining self-control by the service providers,
the adoption of technical solutions such as rating and filtering software
and the provision of monitoring intelligence by Internet users themselves.
At the same time the Commission adopted a Green Paper on the Protection
of Minors and Human Dignity in Audio-Visual and Information Services designed
to engender debate on regulatory and legislative controls for particular
types of illegal material, including antisemitic and racist material. The
Green Paper invited comment on three themes – strengthening legal protection,
encouraging parental control systems, and improving international co-operation,
and it is the consideration of these by the European Parliament and interested
parties in member states, that has led to a broad consensus on the problem
of illegal racist material on the Internet. During 1997 the European Commission
adopted a Proposal for a Recommendation of the Protection of Minors and
Human Dignity, and an Action Plan promoting safe use of the Internet. The
two documents are designed to be complementary. The Recommendation is legal
in nature and aito promote common guidelines for the implementation, at
national level, of a frafor self-regulation and the Action Plan provides
financial support for specific action on creating a safe environment, developing
filtering and rating systems, education among users, and support action
in the legal and economic spheres. In essence, the initiatives implemented
thus far place responsibility for combating illegal content, at source,
with law enforcement agencies whose activities would be governed by national
laws and international agreement on judicial co-operation. It is expected
that this will lead to the pooling of experience and information and the
training of police officers and the judiciary, although the Internet industry
is expected to play its part in reducing illegal content, particularly
anti-Semitic and racist material, through self-regulation, codes of conduct
and the establishment of hotlines.
<p>On another tack, the Working Party on Illegal and Harmful Content on
the Internet was established following the 1996 Communication, and its
area of research was extended when, in September 1996, the Telecommunications
Council agreed to the addition of representatives of the Ministers of Telecommunications,
service providers and others. The Working Party reported twice, in November
1996 and in June 1997. Their reports led to the adoption, in February 1997
of the Council Resolution on Illegal and Harmful Content on the Internet
which invited EU states to adopt self-regulatory systems including representative
bodies for service providers and users, effective codes of conduct, hotline
reporting mechanisms for the public and the provision of filtering mechanisms
and rating systems. The Resolution also requested the European Commission
to follow-up on previously suggested measures, which included faster co-ordination
and exchange of information on best practice and research at a community
level, and further consider the question of legal liability of Internet
content.
<p>In April 1997 the European Parliament adopted a resolution based on
the Council Resolution, and a report by Pierre Pradier, Chairman of the
Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. The Resolution inter-alia
called on member states to define common rules in their criminal laws,
strengthen administrative co-operation on the basis of joint guidelines,
and after consultation with the Parliament, the establishment of a common
framework for self-regulation which would include objectives to be achieved
in terms of the protection of minors and human dignity; principles governing
representation of the industries concerned and the decision making procedures;
measures to encourage the information and communications industry to develop
message protection and filtering software, which should be made available
to subscribers; appropriate arrangements to ensure that all instances child
pornography be reported to the police and shared with Europol and Interpol.
With respect to illegal and harmful content on the Internet the Resolution
called on the Commission, and the member states, to encourage the development
of a common international rating system compatible with the Platform for
Internet Content Selection (PICS) protocol which would be sufficiently
flexible to accommodate cultural differences.
<p>An international ministerial conference (‘Global Information Networks:
Realising the Potential’), was held in Bonn in July 1997 as a consequence
of the Council Resolution (of February 1997) and brought together all the
players in the ict industries, as well as representatives of users and
other international organizations. A number of declarations followed the
Conference which inter-alia stressed the role which the private sector
can play in protecting the interest of consumers and in protecting and
respecting ethical standards through properly functioning systems of self-regulation.
<p>At the police level the Justice and Home Affairs Council is sponsoring
practical co-operation among law enforcement agencies and specific working
groups have been established to look at the question of the lawful interception
of Internet telecommunications. Work is also being carried out with a view
to investigating police and judicial co-operation and the P8 Senior Level
group on transnational organized crime is investigating mechanisms to locate,
identify and prosecute computer-related crime. In April 1997 a European
Commission and Europol communication to European police forces requested
that they monitor illegal content on the Internet, seek out ‘reporting’
points, investigate cross border links, exchange information, reconcile
national laws and co-operate on investigations.[17]
<p>In Britain the government’s views have been put forcefully in recent
years. In responding to a Parliamentary question in October 1996, on behalf
of the President of the Board of Trade, Ian Taylor MP, stated that “the
basis for the government’s approach is that the Internet is not a legal
vacuum: the law applies on-line as it does off it.”[18]
<p>Later, the Junior Home Office Minister, Timothy Kirkhope MP, stated
that the Internet was being monitored for incidents of minority groups
being threatened. He stated that “the activities of neo-Nazi groups are
an increasing worry … the use of the Internet is a particular concern,
because it means that links can be made between these groups and information
can be exchanged.”[19]
<p>The police view was given by Sir Paul Condon, Commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police in an address to the Inter-Parliamentary Council Against anti-Semitism
in February 1997, when he stated that the Telecommunications Act 1984 was
among a battery of laws which would provide a basis for prosecuting anti-Semitic
which incited race hatred on the Internet.
<p>Government spokesmen have continued to make authoritative statements
on the UK approach. In January 1998, Home Office Minister, Mike O’Brien
stated, in response to a Parliamentary question, that “the Government deplore
the distribution—via the Internet or any other medium—of anti-Semitism
or racially inflammatory material ... Material passing over the Internet
is subject to the same laws, provided that it falls within our jurisdiction,
as material being distributed by other means. The Public Order Act 1986
makes provision to deal with material which is threatening, abusive or
insulting and intended or likely to stir up racial hatred.”[20]
<p>In March 1998, he stated, again in response to a Parliamentary question
about the use of the Internet to spread racist and anti-Semitism propaganda,
that the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) had been in close
liaison with other countries to combat Internet abuse, and that the G7
Action Plan on High-Tech Crime committed the UK to developing closer links
to combat Internet crime more effectively. He added, in response to a further
question, that the Home Secretary had recently discussed these matters
with G8 colleagues and that it was their belief that the way forward was
for the issue to be tackled via international co-operation.[21]
<p>A few months later, in September 1998, the Home Secretary himself stated
that the UK was cracking down on racist material published on the Internet
and that the Government had asked governments across the world to work
together to remove illegal websites and prosecute those responsible. He
added that NCIS would be acting against threatening abusive and racist
material.[22] A few days later an NCIS spokesman said that NCIS would be
combating racism on the Internet, and that it could identify the jurisdiction
that illegal material originated from, and would pass such information
on to the relevant national authorities.[23]
<p>Police action so far has tended to reflect national judicial attitudes
towards hate crime. In Germany and Austria, where Holocaust denial and
public manifestations of Nazism are illegal the governments have acted
with a severity that other countries might find unacceptable. In December
1995, the Munich Public Prosecutor’s Office closed down CompuServe as a
result of its alleged dissemination of illegal (neo-Nazi) material, and
in 1997 forced ito cut worldwide access to offensive sites, although it
now appears that no criminal prosaction will be taken. In January 1996,
Deutsche Telekom the largest provider of Internet services in Germany,
cut off access to Web Communications, which rents space to the neo-Nazi
propagandist Ernst Zundel. However this also resulted in subscribers losing
access to another 1500 websites. In March 1997 the Viennese police raided
the offices of the service provider Burgerform, and at least 20 private
homes, seizing computers for evidence that they had been used to download
and distribute Nazi material originating in America.
<p>In Canada a different approach has been adopted. Canadian law prescribes
so-called hate or bias crimes but the courts have yet to adjudicate on
such crimes committed on the Internet. However the view generally held
is that the medium by which such messages are transmitted is immaterial.
In May 1997, the Human Rights Commission began proceedings to indict Ernst
Zundel and his web page, the Zundelsite, under the Canadian Human Rights
Act. Zundel has argued that his site does not come under Canadian jurisdiction
as it is uploaded from California by his colleague Ingrid Rimland, but
it has been the contention of those who brought the complaint that Rimland
merely acts as his agent and that she receives regular instructions from
him as to what is posted. The trial hearing is now into its second year
as a consequence of varying objections brought by Zundel and his lawyers.
<p>In British Columbia, Fairview Technology Centre Ltd, run by Bernard
Klatt had been hosting American and European neo-Nazi sites, but was forced
to close down following complaints to BC Tel, his service provider, that
the site hosted customers who promoted race hatred, and that it was in
breach of its service contract. Among the sites it hosted were the US Nazi
Party, the (British) National Socialist Movement, the European Nationalist
Party, the Euro-Christian Defence League and the (French) Charlemagne Hammerskins.
BC Tel refused to renew Klatt’s contract and his case is now the subject
of a police and judicial investigation, but Klatt himself has moved his
operation across the border into the US and continues to post material
that would be illegal according to Canadian, and European norms.
<p>Any police action that is considered must now inevitably focus on the
fact that the much offensive and illegal material originates in America,
where the First Amendment to the Constitution protects all free expression
of opinion except that which directly incites violence. The draft Communications
Decency Act, with potentially stringent penalties for improper use of cyberspace,
has been challenged by free speech activists, and has been struck down
by the Supreme Court but individual states have begun to take legal action
bypassing the First Amendment issue. In California legislation was passed
that treats electronic words in the same way as written or spoken ones,
and speech that ‘seriously threatens’ as a crime, and Maryland has been
considering draft legislation to make it illegal to send annoying or embarrassing
e-mail. In Pennsylvania, state attorneys brought a successful civil action,
requesting injunctive and other equitable relief, against Stormfront and
Alpha HQ, its service provider. To lessen the possibility that Stormfront
might argue that they were being made martyrs of, the action was bought
against everybody along the chain, back to the service provider. On their
site Stormfront had identified, by name and photographs, a local human
relations council (the Reading-Berks Human Relations Council) and one of
its staff members, stating that she was race traitor and should beware.
<p>The French authorities met less success in November 1998 when a criminal
prosecution was brought against Robert Faurisson, a former academic who
has been convicted by the French courts on several occasions for promoting
Holocaust denial. In this action, which was joined by a number of civil
parties representing former members of the French Resistance, deportees
and the French League for the Defence of Human Rights, the courts found
that it was unable to prove a link between the defendant and the offending
texts on the Internet, despite the fact that his name was on the document.
The absence of any initiative on the part of the defendant to remove his
name from the heading of the offending document was immaterial, and the
case was dismissed.[24]
<p>In Britain, the Crown Prosecution Service has also encountered some
difficulties, at the time of writing, in a possible case against David
Myatt of the National Socialist Movement, who had published a neo-Nazi
terrorism manual but had sought to evade British legal jurisdiction by
having it uploaded from Bernard Klatt’s Fairview Technology site in British
Columbia, Canada. This would have been the first UK prosecution.
<p>It is now generally acknowledged by the police and Prosecution Service
that a successful prosecution could now be brought provided the jurisdictional
and evidential hurdles have been overcome. The purveyors of hate material
however are also quick to spot legal developments and are now registering
their sites abroad. This parallels the trend of the early 1990s to print
and publish offensive literature and leaflets from the US.
<p><b>The Future for Policing the Net</b>
<p>The two problems mentioned above, that of balancing free speech with
the protection of human rights, and the necessity to establish jurisdiction,
exist but states do now appear to be moving towards policing the most offensive
postings, albeit at different paces and in slightly different ways.
<p>It is clear however that there is now a realization that cyberspace
provides a new and dangerous arena in which Far Right extremists can operate
and that they are using it to spread their messages of hate, which are
designed to offend and to incite violence. Law enforcement agencies appear
to be keen to prosecute in most countries, but recognize the dangers and
therefore have so far adopted a cautious approach. Pressure on educationalists,
service providers, and others who are involved in examining the use of
technical options and voluntary codes of conduct to regulate the Internet,
will also prove effective in due course. What is important however is to
bar access to the promoters of hate without stifling free comment and the
expression of ideas and speech. Many extremist groups see the Internet
as the last forum free from government interference. Some see the introduction
of regulation as part of an external campaign by central governments to
destroy ‘free’ thought. They are likely therefore to resist regulation
vigorously and imaginatively. Some of the counter measures being suggested
such as PICS and the use of filters may bar pornographic sites effectively
but they are ineffective against hate sites. Greater success is more likely
to be achieved through a combination of a complaint-driven regime, by which
service providers react to referrals from the public, criminal prosecution
of those who post such messages, and a educational process which outlaws
race hate through whichever medium it is disseminated.
