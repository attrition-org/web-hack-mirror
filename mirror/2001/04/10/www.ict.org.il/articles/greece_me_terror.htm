<p><b>By <a href="#author">Spiros Ch. Kaminaris</a></b>
<p>This article was published by MIDDLE EAST REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
(MERIA), <a href="#meria">MERIA JOURNAL</a>, Volume 3, Number 2 (June 1999).
<p><i>This article examines Greece’s policy in the Middle East. The focus
is on how its own problems, especially with Turkey, have shaped Greece’s
foreign policy. Of special interest is the Greek handling of international
terrorism originating from the Middle East and how different governments
in Athens have followed varying approaches on these issues.</i>
<p>International terrorism in this article is represented by incidents
in which terrorists of foreign nationality have gone to Greece seeking
victims or symbolic targets there that represent a foreign state. Historically,
these groups have included Arab, usually Palestinian, organizations selecting
American and Israeli targets; and Kurdish or Armenian groups, choosing
Turkish targets. In the past these included the Kurdish PKK as well as
the Palestinian May 15 Organization, Abu Nidal group, Popular Struggle
Front, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), PLO, and Black
September, and also Lebanese Shiite groups.
<p>The operational preferences by such groups for Greece can be explained
by several factors:
<p><b>Local Support Base: </b>Greece has large numbers of ethnic Kurds
and Arabs some of whom can provide a logistical infrastructure to support
their operations.
<p><b>Geographic Location:</b> Greece’s geographical proximity to the Middle
East, north Africa, and Eastern Europe make it a useful transit point or
for international terrorist groups. The fact that Greece is an EU member
and has participated in the reduction of travel barriers in Europe makes
cross-border movements relatively open.
<p><b>Presence of Targets:</b> The primary targeted countries, (the United
States, Israel, and Turkey, for example) have a presence in Greece including
embassies and other offices, Jewish institutions, companies, and other
facilities.
<p><b>Good Prospects for Publicity: </b>Greece’s location in Europe and
the presence of a free press are two factors facilitating prominent coverage
of incidents which is, after all, a primary consideration of international
terrorist groups.
<p><b>Permissive Atmosphere:</b> At times, Greece’s security services have
been ineffective against groups and the political leadership less eager
to prevent or punish operations compared to other countries.
<p>Let us consider this last point during five periods in modern Greek
history:
<p><b>1. George Papadopoulos’s Military Junta (1967-74):</b>
<br>During this era, Middle East and Arab international terrorist groups
imported their activities into Greece at the end of the 1960s. They sought
to use hijackings and hostage-taking to achieve international publicity
and strike against their enemies, and then as a bargaining chip to release
captured comrades from Greek jails.
<p>While the Greek military junta took a hard line toward local opposition,
it followed a soft line toward international terrorism on Greek soil. The
most important incident took place in August 1973. Two members of the PLO’s
Black September organization pulled out machine guns and grenades at Athens
airport, killing 3 people and wounding 55 passengers. The duo then seized
35 hostages, but soon surrendered to Athens police. After a one-day trial,
a Greek court sentenced them to death.
<p>In February 1974, three gunmen hijacked the Greek freighter Vory at
the west dock of Karachi port in Pakistan, threatening to blow up the ship
and kill two hostages if the Greek government did not free the two Arab
terrorists of the previous attack. As part of a deal, which emerged in
April 1974, the convicted terrorists’ death sentences were commuted to
life imprisonment. Later the Greek government pardoned them and, in May
1974, they were deported to Libya at the request of Tripoli.
<p>International terrorism and hostage situations were something new for
the whole international community. The junta was inexperienced and hesitant
in trying to free the hostages, since a failure might have damaged its
image. Making a compromise was intended to save the hostages, preserve
relations with radical regimes and groups, and get the government out of
a crisis. Concessions were also intended to avoid future attacks against
Greece, though arguably appeasement had the opposite result.
<p><b>2. Konstantinos Karamanlis’s New Democracy government (1974-1981)</b>
<br>The dramatic rise in oil prices--making some Arab states important
potential markets and patrons--along with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus,
led Greek policy to tilt in a way which made Greece look soft and sympathetic
toward international terrorism and its sponsors.
<p>During this period, sporadic Palestinian terrorist acts continued to
take place. The most publicized incident was the June 1976 hijacking of
an Air France airbus by seven PFLP commandos shortly after it left Athens
airport. The plane was diverted to Entebbe airport in Uganda. The episode
received international publicity focusing on Athens airport’s lax security
measures, followed by the spectacular rescue operation by Israeli forces.
<p>Arguably, Greek security measures were not alone in their inability
to deal with terrorism during that period. Dramatic episodes took place
in other European countries, too. For example, in December 1975 OPEC ministers
were seized as hostages in Vienna by “Carlos.” In October 1977 came the
hijack of a Lufthansa plane departing from Spain and taken to Somalia,
in which the German Special Forces in a daring rescue operation freed the
hostages. [1]
<p>Still, the situation in Greece did reflect specific local conditions,
too. The reputation of the Greek civil security forces was severely damaged
by their participation in the junta. The Karamanlis’ government limited
the police’s role and stripped the military of its internal security functions.
Old habits of brutality had to be abandoned and several policemen were
tried for using torture and other human rights’ violations. While necessary,
such steps might have affected the police’s performance and efficiency
as an institution.
<p><b>3. Andreas Papandreou’s PASOK government (1981-1989)</b>
<br>A sympathy for radical Arab regimes and causes was encouraged and,
to some extent, exploited by Papandreou’s ambition to promote Greek leadership
of Third World states, as a third force between the capitalist West and
the Communist East, which of course was viewed with distaste by the United
States, Great Britain, Israel and Turkey.
<p>During this era, terrorist activities in Greece increased partly as
a result of Papandreou’s 1981 policy of “anoigma,” opening to the Arab
world. In this context, Greece granted official recognition to the PLO
at the end of 1981, and adopted a stronger stand than any other EC government
against Israel.
<p>This tactic was the result of ideological, political and economic considerations.
Ideologically, a powerful faction within Papandreou’s political party advocated
the reorientation of Greek foreign policy toward nonalignment. This policy
was called “Tritokosmikos” (Thirdworldism). Politically, Papandreou hoped
to win the support of Arab nations on the Cyprus and Aegean issues. A strong
pro-Palestinian stand as well as pro-Armenian and later pro-Kurdish support
was intended to move the Arabs, Armenians and Kurds closer to Greek positions
vis-a-vis Turkey. Finally, there was an expectation that the pro-Arab policy
would bring Arab investments into the country.
<p>Terrorist incidents with international implications appeared especially
in 1984 and afterwards. They began with the case of Jordanian Abdallah
Fuad Shara, a member of the May 15 terrorist organization. He was arrested
in April 1984 by British and American agents in a raid in his apartment
in Athens. The Greek authorities released him and provided safe passage
to Algeria, claiming that the evidence was not strong and that the foreign
agents “violated international law and Greek sovereignty,” acting or their
own and without a proper authorization. [2]
<p>More tension came in February 1985 with a bomb explosion, claimed by
the Greek Cypriot right-wing National Front group. The bomb exploded at
a popular hangout forU.S.servicemen from the American air base in Glyfada,
near Athens. Seventy-eight people (including 55 Americans) were injured
but there were no fatalities. The Americans blamed Papandreou’s anti-American
“damaging comments.” [3]
<p>Further trouble erupted in June 1985 when Lebanese gunmen hijacked a
TWA jetliner carrying 153 passengers, after it had taken off from Athens
airport. This led to an intense crisis at Beirut airport and the death
of one American sailor. [4] As a result, the U.S. State Department warned
its citizens in July of the high risk of terrorism at Athens airport, which
elicited a strong Greek protest. Additional incidents affected not only
Greece’s reputation and relations with the United States but also damaged
the economy by affecting the tourism industry. The Greek Tourist Organization
estimated that Reagan’s travel advisory in 1985 alone cost Greece $400
million. [5]
<p>The unhappiness of President Ronald Reagan’s administration with Papandreou’s
thirdworldism intensified U.S.-Greek friction, especially given the Greek
government’s frequent criticisms of U.S. policy, and Greece’s direct links
with the PLO and Qaddafi’s Libya. There was also concern over the future
of U.S. bases in Greece.
<p>At the time, the U.S. government was pressing European states to take
a more forceful line against international terrorism. Greece got its reputation
for being soft on the issue by disagreeing. Among other points, the Greek
government’s refusal was based on an argument that Greece’s coastline and
hundred of islands made it hard to keep out determined terrorists. In reality,
though, this stance was a result of other issues, including an effort to
protect Greek business interests in the Arab world.
<p>For example, the Hellenic Arms Industry [EBO] was established in 1977
with the task of manufacturing light infantry weapons for the Greek armed
forces. The company, however, developed the capability to produce a broad
range of weapons not only for domestic consumption but also for export.
As a result, Greek weapons production by 1985 had expanded beyond its original
purpose of domestic production of systems to support national defense and
was making a positive impact on the national economy through its earnings
in hard currencies. In December 1984, EBO concluded an agreement with Libya
to sell it $500 million in military equipment over the next four years.
Under the terms of the economic agreement with Libya, Greece agreed to
sell equipment that was Greek designed and Greek made. Greece was a net
exporter of arms, in which the economic impact of the developing defence
industry has been significant. In 1983 sales amounted to over $120 million,
3.6 percent of Greece’s total exports. In late 1985, Libya signed an agreement
with Greece covering the sale of $500 million in equipment, including the
Artemis-30 antiaircraft gun and the Steyr armored personnel carrier, manufactured
in Greece under license from Austria. [6]
<p>Greece was also soft with the Arabs as a result of Turkey’s Cyprus invasion
in 1974 which created a psychological complex in Greek politics and military
circles of a continuing threat from the Turks. When Papandreou assumed
power, for instance, he was briefed and re-briefed by the General staff
the possibility of a surprise attack from the East. Paying attention to
Papandreou’s rhetoric, one could come to a conclusion that Papandreou was
paranoid and suspicion us of “dark forces”, such as Turkey, CIA, KGB, domestic
revolutionaries (17N and ELA) with the desire to bring his government down.[7]
<p>To counter that potential danger, Papandreou and his political party
tried to improve Greece’s intelligence capabilities by exploiting “the
connection factor,” with the leaders of Syria, Iraq, Libya and PLO. The
Arabs did not have intelligence capabilities in Turkey, but pretended they
did. They provided false information, often believed, creating many alerts
and even partial mobilizations. Such cooperation with the socialist and
revolutionary Arabs, in turn, affected Greece’s relations with conservative
Arabs, and Israelis who openly accused the Greek government of tolerating
terrorism. [8]
<p><b>4. Constantine Mitsotakis’s New Democracy government (1990-93)</b>
<br>In 1991, and after a series of weak coalition governments, Mitsotakis
tried to normalize Greco-American relations by following a pro-American,
pro-Israeli foreign policy. That was achieved by signing first an agreement
maintaining the U.S. bases on Greek soil and second with de Jure recognition
of Israel. Greece was the only community member without full ties with
Israel. Relations under Papandreou (1981 to 1989) were maintained only
at the consular level and the atmosphere in Athens had been chilly toward
Israel since Greece was supporting the Palestinian cause.[9] In contrast,
Mitsotakis pursued tough policies towards terrorism.
<p>Following Greece’s support of the Desert Storm operation against Iraq’s
aggression to Kuwait, in January 1991 the Greek police arrested and deported
suspected terrorists. During the evening of January 19, 1991, four Iraqis
were deported. Thirteen other Arabs, including Iraqis, Libyans, Jordanians,
Algerians, and six Palestinians [the latter holding Iraqi or Jordanian
passports] being held in Attiki prison, were scheduled to be deported and
eight others were being held in jail. [10]
<p>The major incident of international terrorism during this period occurred
in April 1991 when members of the Islamic Holy War Movement triggered prematurely
a bomb aimed at the British consulate in Patras. Instead, it wrecked the
offices of Air Courier Service, a Greek company, killing seven people including
the Palestinian carrying the bomb. [11]
<p>Once the identity of the bomb carrier was established, three days after
the explosion, the former PLO representative in Athens, Mansur Gadur was
expelled from Greece, together with five other “diplomats” and twenty more
Palestinians. [12] An Athens court used the anti-terrorist law to sentence
to life the two captured Palestinians responsible for the explosion. Four
other terrorists connected with this incident were convicted and jailed.
As a result, the Patras incident marked the first time the Greek authorities
were able to break a terrorist network of any kind and apply the new anti-terrorist
law. [13]
<p><b>5. Papandreou’s return to power and replacement by Constantine Simitis
(1993-1997)</b>
<br>Early elections in 1993 brought Andreas Papandreou and his party back
to ppower. During this period incidents of Arab terrorism dropped dramatically
as a result of the signing of the historic peace accord at the White House
between PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
on September 13, 1993. This facilitated the extradition or release of convicted
and captured terrorists.
<p>Such was the extradition of Abd al-Rahim Khalid to Italy and Muhammad
Rashid’s release from prison. Khalid, one of the four-member Palestinian
squad which seized the Achille Lauro cruise ship off Egypt and killed an
elderly Jewish-American, was flown from Athens to Genoa, where he had been
sentenced in absentia to life in prison in 1987. He had been in jail in
Greece since 1991 on charges of illegal possession of drugs and weapons.
[14]
<p>Rashid Muhammad was the Palestinian responsible for planting a bomb
on a Pan American airline plane in Brazil in 1982 killing a teenager, and
of a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which
killed four U.S. citizens. He was arrested by Greek police, after a tip-off
from U.S. officials, trying to enter Greece with false passport. A Greek
court in 1992 sentenced him to 18 years in prison. His sentence was reduced
to 15 years in 1993. In 1996 according to judicial sources and press reports,
Rashid was given five days leave from a maximum security prison over Greece’s
Orthodox Easter for good behavior. Rashid’s pass made some Greek officials,
furious because it preceded a bomb attack on a Greek supreme court prosecutor,
and angered the United States, because another convicted Palestinian Majid
al-Mulqi, had just escaped in Italy during a similar prison leave for good
behavior. Finally, in 1996 Rashiwas fafter only 8 and a half years in prison
and deported to Tunisia. The Greek government claimed that it took that
course after being warned by Palestinian groups that they would hit Greek
targets if Rashid was to be extradited to the United States. [15]
<p>While Arab terrorist incidents declined, activities against Greece’s
neighbors increased. During the Greek-Macedonian [FYROM] talks to normalize
relations between the two Balkan states, the negotiations were undermined
by terrorist incidents, such as a bomb attack in an attempt to assassinate
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and a bomb threat on a plane carrying
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Nevertheless, Greece did succeed
in achieving favorable diplomatic concessions and developed good relations
and economic opportunities in the Balkan States. [16]
<p>In April 1994, Albania accused Greece of creating border incidents when
gunmen shot dead two Albanian border-guards and shouted slogans supporting
the ethnic Greek minority in Albania. Although Greek security forces managed
to arrest the terrorist group one year later, incidents such as this, led
to diplomatic expulsions and retaliations. [17]
<p>Regarding Greece’s “eastern front”, Greek-Turkish relations came under
further strain with two assassinations of Turkish diplomats on July 1994.
These incidents were followed by retaliatory hits on Greek islands injuring
tourists. It has been suggested that it was an act of revenge for the assassination
of the Turkish diplomats, with the intention to harm the Greek tourist
industry and to break Greek-Turkish negotiations over EU and Cyprus.
<p>This incident had come at a time, however, when Greece was working to
improve relations with Turkey. For the six months after January 1994 when
Greece had held the EU presidency, however, Papandreou did not want to
annoy the other members by blocking Turkey’s entry into the European Union.
He had been carrying out secret negotiations with Turkey proposing to accept
Turkey’s customs union with the EU in return for firm timetable for making
Cyprus a full EU member and finding a solution to the Cyprus problem. [18]
<p>More tension was created in 1997 between Greece and Turkey after an
article published in the British newspaper Sunday Observer revealed links
among leaders of the leftist Greek terrorist organization November 17,
the Greek secret service and the PKK, claiming that Athens sheltered and
trained PKK rebels who planned attacks in Turkey. [19]
<p>Analysts at that time characterized this story as a Turkish attempt
to damage the image of Greece for a number reasons, such as to prevent
the shipment and installation on Cyprus of the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles, to weaken Greek positions during negotiations over disputed issues
in Cyprus and the Aegean Sea, and to block the Greek veto of Turkish admission
to EU. [20]
<p>Turkish fears, however, that the Greek government was helping the PKK
seemed vindicated in the events around the capture of the PKK’s leader,
Abdallah Ocalan, by the Turks. Greek attempts to help Ocalan find a safe
haven provided evidence of direct involvement by the Greek government with
terrorism.
<p>The Kurdish guerrilla leader, Ocalan, had been expelled by Syria under
Turkish pressure in late 1998. He had sought political asylum in Italy.
But while Italy would not extradite him to Turkey--since Italian law forbade
extraditing someone to a country where he might face capital punishment—it
was also reluctant to give safe haven to a man branded publicly a “terrorist”
by Prime Minister Massimo D’Alema. The Italian media in mid-January 1999
said Ocalan, had gone to Moscow. The hunt for Ocalan ended in February
1999, when he was found enjoying the hospitality of the Greek ambassador
to Kenya. [21]
<p>Apparently, pro-Kurdish Greeks had been helping him in his travels around
Europe, even furnishing him with a private plane. When he turned up in
Athens on January 29, Ocalan apparently stayed for the weekend in a safe
house provided by Greeks who had campaigned for the Kurdish cause. After
failing to find a safe haven in Belarus, he reportedly returned to Greece
on February 2. He was then flown to stay at the Greek ambassador’s residence
in Nairobi, Kenya, with the understanding that Greece would try to persuade
an African country or perhaps the Netherlands to accept him. [22]
<p>It is now believed that Prime Minister Simitis ordered the Greek secret
service to remove Ocalan from Greece and Greek protection, out of concern
that Turkey would become aware of his presence and close ties with Greece,
triggering a crisis that could even lead to war. Sending Ocalan to Kenya
was thus a way to get Greece out of a problem which had been created by
private individuals within the country. For example, disciples of Papandreou
were portraying Ocalan and the PKK as noble guerrillas fighting for independence
from Turkey, just as Greeks did in the last century. [23]
<p>At any rate, this incident became a fiasco for Greek foreign policy.
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, along with other Greek politicians
from various political affiliations, were trying to weaken Turkey by supporting
the terrorist group PKK. [24] These revelations contradicted Greece’s apparent
political trend away from supporting radical Middle East regimes and groups.
After all, by 1986, Papandreou’s policy of support of “national liberation
struggles” started to face serious problems in both international and domestic
credibility.
<p>The killing of Greek citizens by terrorists at home and abroad threw
into question the concept that appeasement would buy Greece immunity from
attack. Three Greeks were also among those killed in the simultaneous Arab
terrorist attacks on El Al service counters at the Rome and Vienna airports.
Afterwards, the opposition and foreign press criticized Papandreou policies
towards PLO. [25]
<p>Furthermore, incidents such as the Kristallis fiasco, and corruption
among the anti-terrorist squad shown in the Koskotas scandal, damaged Papandreou
and the credibility of Greece’s Central Intelligence Agency. Daniel Kristallis,
an agent of the KYP [Greece’s Central Intelligence Agency], was arrested
as a suspected terrorist. He claimed that he worked for four other intelligence
services. Apparently, he had placed bombs and then took money for providing
false information on the explosions. Opposition parties pressed for reorganizing
the KYP and gaining better parliamentary control. [26] George Koskotas,
former chairman of the Bank of Crete and a close associate of high-level
PASOK officials, was accused of misusing more than $209 million in bank
funds. While he was under around-the-clock surveillance by anti-terrorist
squad and about to be arrested, he managed flee the country. [27]
<p>Greek policies also went through a reappraisal as Papandreou became
incapacitated with illness in 1995 and when he died in 1996. Greece faced
serious problems since it was at the bottom of the European Union, with
little prospect of joining the single currency in the first wave. The new
prime minister, Simitis, tried to bring Greece’s politico-economic strategies
into line with the EU’s economic criteria while improving Greece’s diplomatic
image with the other European states and the United States.
<p>As a result, in August 1996 Greece reduced backing for the Kurdish PKK
and began negotiations with Turkey. [28] In 1997, when the United States
criticized Greece for failing to join other European states which recalled
ambassadors from Tehran after a German court found Iran had ordered political
murders in Germany, the Greek government complied. [29] Moreover, the Greek
Government also extradited a number of captured terrorists wanted in Europe.
<p>While Papandreou’s and Pasok’s views and the hope of profitable trade
were factors affecting the Greek attitude toward international terrorist
issues, the most single important factor was the relationship with Turkey
and the Cyprus issue. In the past, Greek counter-terrorism forces were
less enthusiastic to capture international terrorists (Arabs and Kurds)
mainly because the Greek governments did not want to alienate Arab and
Kurdish supporover Cyprusor damage Greek investments and business in Middle
East.
<p>Greek foreign policy is influenced by the Great Idea strategy which
sets Greece’s mission as protecting ethnic Greeks and Greek heritage everywhere
in the world. Thus, Greek interests and policy regarding Cyprus are both
of great importance and are different from those of other countries. A
permissive attitude toward international terrorism (assisting terrorists
or wanting good relations with terrorism-sponsoring countries) could be
seen as a strategy for continuing war with Turkey by other means. The purpose
is to compel Ankara to submit to territorial and national claims over Cyprus
and Aegean disputes. In that sense assisting international terrorist could
be seen as a bargaining chip to gain concessions in negotiations, as a
way of equalizing the power balance between Greece and its neighbor. [30]
<p>The Turkish invasion of Cyprus heightened both Greek hatred and fear
of Turkey’s power. The economic and security policies of the 1980s to build
relations with the Arabs and other Third World countries (the “anoigma”
and “allagi” strategies) was part of the effort to counterbalance Turkey.
Greek foreign policy also sought to befriend other enemies of Turkey including
Armenians and the PKK. [31]
<p>In 1998, Turkey threatened to attack Cyprus when Russia was about to
deliver $400 million worth of advanced surface-to-air missiles, SAM-300s,
to Greek Cyprus in late November, 1998. Deployment of the Russian missiles
was seen by Greece and Greek Cypriots as a powerful weapon to balance Turkish
air superiority over the island.
<p>Greece was motivated not only by the Cyprus issue but also by Greek-Turkish
differences in Aegean Sea and the Turkish-Israeli alliance which undoubtedly
pushes Greece to become even more directly involved in Middle East politics.
Greece took steps to solidify its ties not only with Russia but with Syria,
Armenia, Iraq and Iran.
<p>During the threats of a preemptive air strike, the Turkish foreign minister
had asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for help in preventing
the missiles from reaching Greek Cyprus. Although the Israelis explicitly
denied any intention of becoming involved, the Greek Cypriot government
urged the Russians to exert counter-pressure on Israel to stay out. [32]
<p>This situation, one could argue, has contributed toward forming two
military blocs in the region, with an active Greek political presence.
At the center of one block stand Turkey and Israel, both non-Arab, democratic,
and Western- oriented countries. Each maintains a large military and both
have problems with Syria, Iran, and Iraq. Turkey and Israel also developed
friendly relations with Jordan. Jordanian and Turkish military pilots train
in each other’s countries. Their chiefs of staff meet regularly and their
governments have created a high-level formal group to discuss the menace
posed to each of them by Iraq.
<p>Opposed to this arrangement are Syria and Iran. Greece occupies a position
of importance analogous to that of Jordan on the other side. This view
of its Middle Eastern and European neighborhoods also has larger implications
for Greek interests. In the Caucasus, Azerbaijan and Georgia line up with
Turkey, whereas Armenia is closer with Iran. Russia is favorable toward
Greece. In the Balkans, Macedonia, Bosnia, Slovenia, and Croatia tend toward
Turkey’s side; Yugoslavia has been closer to Greece. In Central Asia, Kazakstan,
Kirgizia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan side with Turkey, while Tajikistan
has had good relations with Iran.
<p>In practice, then, both alliances and attitudes toward terrorism unfold
from a state’s or specific government’s view of its vital interests. This
applies both to the sponsorship of terrorism and the degree to which a
country makes an effort to deter, punish, or even to define terrorism.
[33]
<p>Among the prime determinants of Greek policy toward the Middle East
and toward international terrorism will be the degree of stability in its
relationship with Turkey and the security--or lack of security—Athens feels
in both the European and Middle East regions. Such issues as Greece’s relationship
with the EU, alliance with the United States, and role in the troubled
Balkans all become inputs in setting its Middle East policy. [34]
<p>In general, Greece’s most immediate and important policy goal is growing
integration with Europe, seeking investment to fuel economic growth. Greece
continues to rely heavily on EU aid, which currently amounts to about 4
percent of GDP. Thus, friction with Turkey, an arms race, increased defense
spending, involvement in Middle East rivalries, and such diplomatic embarrassments
as the Ocalan fiasco undermine Greece’s urgent developmental goals. This
does not mean that Greece will necessarily avoid these traps, but doing
so is at least the country’s current preferences.

the Rheinmetall 20mm cannon; the Mauser 30mm model F cannon; 81mm mortars;
and other small arms equipment. The Lavrion plant employed over 400 in
the production of ammunition and explosives. EBO has also developed weapons
systems for domestic use; the ARTEMIS-30, a small antiaircraft system,
was developed for use by the Greek army in the Aegean. This system found
an international market.

<p>[16] The bomb killed Gligorov’s driver and wounded three bystanders
in the center of the Macedonian capital. If Gligorov had been killed, it
would have left Macedonia without a skilled leader. Greece could put the
screws back on by keeping trade sanctions. Bulgaria could stir animosity
among Macedonia’s pro-Bulgarian Slavs. The large ethnic Albanian minority
in the west of the country could sharpen demands for more autonomy. Bloodshed
between Serbs and Albanians in Serbia’ s Kosovo province could trickle
dangerously into Macedonia. And it was also feared that Serbia might try
to gobble up Macedonia--south Serbia, as some Serbs call it--as well. However
Macedonia’s own extreme nationalists, were the most likely perpetrators
of the bomb attack since they accused Gligorov for being too soft. See

Shows how Fragile the Republic Is]”, The Economist, 337 (October 7, 1995):

Violence”, Reuters, October 3, 1995. Regarding the bomb threat against
Papoulias, the Greek Foreign Ministry gave no details of who had made the
bomb threat. Papoulias however signed a highly controversial accord earlier
this month with Macedonia (Fyrom). The deal involved the lifting of Greek
sanctions against FYROM and the removal of a symbol from FYROM’s flag which
Greece considered implied a claim to Greek territory. He was due to meet
the foreign minister of Turkey in New York during the UN session. Buchizya
