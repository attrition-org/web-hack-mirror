<BR><B>Tel-Aviv, 1990</B>

<P>The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command
(PFLP-GC) is one of the Palestinian organizations known for their unequivocal
rejection of any kind of political settlement with Israel, and their reliance
on international terrorism to thwart any political process. The PFLP-GC's
dependence on radical state sponsors increases the likelihood that it will
react violently to any successful political process associated with the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

<P>Even beyond the confines of the Palestinian issue, the PFLP-GC retains
both the motivation and the capacity to operate in the international arena.
On December 21, 1988 Pan Am flight 103 exploded in midair over Lockerbie,
Scotland. While Iran was thought to have initiated that spectacular attack,
the PFLP-GC was the major suspect in carrying out the operation.

<P>In this chapter we shall attempt to illuminate the profile of the PFLP-GC,
concentrating on its international dimension.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Historical Background</FONT></B>
<BR><U>The Syrian-sponsored</U> PFLP-GC has been headed by Ahmed Jibril,
a former officer in the Syrian Army, since its establishment in 1968. Jibril
himself had been active in the Palestinian struggle against Israel since
1959, when he established his first group - the <U>Palestine Liberation
Front</U>. Jibril has testified in several interviews that the PLF carried
out its first assault against Israel in 1965. In 1967, the group merged
with the <U>Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),</U> headed
by <U>Dr. George Habash</U>. But the alliance did not last long. The following
year, the pro-Syrian Jibril split with the PFLP against the backdrop of
mounting tensions between Habash and Damascus that led to Habash's arrest
in Syria, and in view of policy differences: unlike Habash, Jibril rejected
any involvement in politics and advocated pure armed struggle;

<P>Jibril now formed the PFLP-GC. Though a member of the <U>PLO</U> from
the start, Jibril's organization consistently opposed the PLO's gradual
shift toward a political orientation that was advocated mainly by Arafat's
<U>Fatah</U>. The first sign of this shift was in June 1974, at the 12th
meeting of the <U>Palestinian National Council (PNC)</U> in Rabat, when
a decision was made to abandon international terrorism and to accept the
establishment of a national authority in any liberated part of Palestine.
Jibril signed the l0-point document summarizing the PNC decisions, but
rejected the implication of the resolution - the readiness to make concessions
in terms of territory and tactical preferences. The PFLP-GC did, however,
comply with the decision to halt international terrorism, and from 1974
until the mid-'80s dramatically lowered its international profile. At the
same time it joined the Palestinian rejectionist front, comprising the
leftist Palestinian organizations that opposed the PLO's political shifts.
Another move by the PFLP-GC was its withdrawal from the PLO Executive Committee
and Central Council, although not from the PNC. In 1977, with the convening
of the 13th PNC, the PFLP-GC reoccupied its seat on the PLO's Executive
Committee. At that time, the stalemate in the Middle East political process
and Arafat's advocacy of a more militant line in effect temporarily enabled
Jibril to rejoin the PLO.

<P>At about this time an internal conflict generated a schism within the
ranks of the PFLP-GC. A group headed by <U>Mahmud Zeidan (Abu al-Abbas)</U>
and sponsored by Iraq left the organization and established the <U>Palestine
Liberation Front (PLF</U>). The direct cause for the split was Jibril's
support for moves conducted by Syria in 1976 against the Palestinians in
the civil war in Lebanon.

<P>Jibril's close links with Syria led him in May 1983 to support a Syrian-backed
mutiny that erupted within Fatah ranks in Lebanon. The mutiny reflected
the opposition of radical factions within the PLO to another shift toward
a political process led by Arafat. In December 1983 this struggle culminated
in Arafat's flight from Tripoli, Lebanon, where he had sought to rebuild
his military base following the expulsion of Fatah from Beirut in September
1982. At this time Syria established the <U>Fatah Rebels</U>, led by <U>Muhammad
Said Musa (Abu Musa),</U> and Jibril broke with the PLO. In 1985, the Abu
Musa group and the PFLP-GC joined the Palestine National Salvation Front
(PNSF), created in reaction to the rapprochement between Fatah and King
Hussein of Jordan. The accord signed between Arafat and Hussein that year
was aimed at furthering a political process in the Middle East, and was
categorically rejected by those Palestinian organizations that still advocated
all-out war against Israel. Nor did the enmity between Jibril and Arafat
end following the cancellation in 1986 of the accord and the subsequent
stagnation in the regional political process.

<P>From 1988, political moves made by Arafat against the backdrop of the
Palestinian popular uprising in the Israeli-administered Territories again
emphasized the discrepancies between the positions of Jibril and the PLO.
Jibril totally rejected the recognition by Arafat of UN resolutions 242
and 338 and his renunciation of terrorism. He accused Arafat of abandoning
the PLO credo, and in 1989 participated in Iranian-sponsored efforts to
create a new organization that would replace the PLO.

<P>By 1990 the PFLP-GC remained outside the PLO. But Jibril's tightening
links with Iran generated internal opposition within his organization.
Led by the PFLP-GC's former representative in the PLO Executive Committee,
Talal Naji, this faction advocated rejoining the PLO and lobbying from
within against Arafat's line, and opposed the shift toward Iran. The political
bureau of the Front reached a compromise resolution, according to which
collaboration with Tehran would continue, yet Naji could veto political
decisions that contradicted his views. This agreement appeared to have
temporarily prevented a split within the PFLP-GC.

<P>The organization, which in 1990 had about 800 members, was based in
<B><U>Syria</U></B>. It maintained bases near Damascus, in the Syrian-controlled
Biq'a and in the coastal region of Lebanon, near Damur. Until late 1989
it had bases and personnel in <B><U>Libya</U></B> as well, but at that
time Qadhafi ordered the expulsion of the organization from the country.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ideology and Strategy</FONT></B>
<BR>The fundamental themes guiding the activity and intra-Palestinian political
path of the PFLP-GC are pan-Arabism, a total rejection of Israel's right
to exist, and advocation of armed struggle as the only way to advance the
Palestinian cause. Hence it has devoted its activity solely to armed struggle,
while dissociating itself from any political course.

<P>Jibril is aware of the Palestinians' limited military capabilities.
He regards Palestinian armed activity against Israel as a mere catalyst
or vanguard force in the fight for the liberation of Palestine, to be followed
by a war led by Arab states. He also claims that the unity of the Arab
world will be achieved through the struggle for Palestine. The process
will be fulfilled in the elimination of Israel and the establishment of
a Palestinian state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.

<P>Jibril attributes a major role to the Palestinian armed struggle in
disrupting any chance for a negotiated settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. An important role attributed to terrorism according to this perception
is that of turning both Israeli and Palestinian moderate forces into extremists.
Therefore he adheres to the ideas articulated in the PLO charter regarding
the strategic role of the armed struggle, and totally rejects the acceptance
by the PNC of the possibility of territorial concessions, even within the
framework of the strategy of stages. Jibril vehemently denounced the declaration
by Arafat at the 19th PNC in November 1988 of a Palestinian state in the
Territories alongside Israel.

<P>The PFLP-GC is stereotypically termed a Marxist-Leninist organization.
Jibril defines his struggle as a war against "imp" and "colonialism" as
embodied in Israel. In his speeches, he advocates a popular struggle aimed
at destroying the "roots of reaction” The United States is considered an
enemy of the Palestinian people due to its support for Israel and the role
it plays in mediating between Israel and the Arab world. Official contacts
between the US administration and the PLO after late 1988 naturally increased
the Front's antagonism toward the US.

<P>An interesting shift in the PFLP-GC mindset took place in 1988, when
this secular Arab organization entered into collaboration with <B><U>Iran.</U></B>
Although the turn to Iran was primarily motivated by pragmatic considerations,
it also reflected Jibril's perception of the changing political balance
of power in the region. Realizing that Syria and Libya had succumbed to
western pressures to cease their support for terrorist groups, Jibril saw
'in the new Islamic force a more powerful backer for the organization's
struggle against the West, and particularly the US. As Arabism had proved
to be too weak a driving force in the struggle for the liberation of Palestine,
Jibril hoped that "victorious Islam" would achieve more. Accordingly, Jibril's
ideological messages were now enriched with Islamic phrases. On March 5,
1989 he pledged to carry out "the Islamic verdict, to protect Islam and
its prophet," against Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses.

<P>Jibril's new-found tendency toward Islam is particularly interesting
in that, unlike other Palestinian organizations, including those on the
Left, Jibril has no specific vision of the future nature of the Palestinian
state. Nor is the PFLP-GC's struggle against Israel restricted to any specific
front, whether cross-border, inside Israel or abroad. However, while action
against Israel on Israeli soil is motivated purely by the goal of armed
struggle, activity abroad is also directed toward serving the interests
of a supportive state.

<P>Because Jibril has rarely publicized his concept of the operational
course of the PFLP-GC, the few declarations he did make may be of some
significance. In September 1982 he announced that the PFLP-GC would escalate
the struggle against Israel, and threatened that this would not be restricted
to the "occupied territories but rather [will be-carried out] in all international
arenas where the enemy and its allies' institutions and interests can be
found." This declaration, which followed the withdrawal of the Palestinian
organizations, including the PFLP-GC, from Beirut, expressed the Front's
vision of the ceaseless struggle against Israel, and its readiness to shift
bases and operational arenas. A more explicit warning was issued in February
1986, when Jibril threatened "any passenger thinking of using Israeli or
American airliners." This declaration was made in response to Israel's
interception of a Syrian airliner flying from Libya. It was reportedly
Ahmed Jibril whom Israel had hoped to capture in that airliner.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Links with States</FONT></B>
<BR>A principal strategic policy of the PLO has been its rejection of any
attempt by a foreign country to' influence the Palestinian decision-making
process ("freedom of decision"). The PFLP-GC, while vowing adherence to
these guidelines, was never reluctant to form close relationships of dependency
with a foreign state. A major reason for this approach has been the organization's
opposition to any political settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
This in effect has released the PFLP-GC from preoccupation with a variety
of political considerations beyond those involving intra-Palestinian matters.

<P>Throughout the years, the PFLP-GC has maintained links of varying degrees
of intensity with three Middle Eastern countries - Syria, Libya and Iran
- that share its adherence to the rejectionist line. As a result, the Front
engaged in terrorist activity, mainly in the international arena, as a
proxy, serving the national interests of the sponsored state rather than
necessarily those of the Palestinian national cause.

<P><B><U>Syria</U></B> has provided the organization with arms, finances,
and bases since its formation The organization's two major camps are located
in the vicinity of Damascus, while activists are also stationed in the
Syrian controlled Biq'a in Lebanon, from where cross-border attacks against
Israel have been initiated

<P>Beginning in 1985 Syria directed a world-wide terrorist campaign aimed
at sabotaging the agreement reached that year between Jordan's King Hussein
and Yasir Arafat. Elements that participated in that campaign were Syrian
state agents, as well as extremist Palestinian organizations, the most
active of which was Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC). Operatives
of the PFLP-GC were also allegedly involved in a related series of attacks,
presumably in association with, or by activating members of, the Palestinian
Popular Struggle Front (PPSF)&middot; Assaults carried out during 1985
that were attributed to PPSF members took place in Scandinavia and Netherlands,
and targeted Jewish, Israeli and American objectives. The head of Syrian
military intelligence, Ali Duba, was said to have activated the cells involved
in the attacks. Ali Duba was reportedly also involved in the establishment
in early 1987 of the PFLP-GC infrastructure in West Germany and Sweden.
Cells of the organization operating in those countries were uncovered in
October 1988.

<P>During 1987 Syria significantly reduced its financial support to the
PFLP-GC&middot; This move was taken on the grounds of economic difficulties,
but may have also been the result of pressure applied to Syria during 1986-1987
by the West. In response, Jibril turned to Libya and Iran seeking financial
support and logistical backing.

<P>Still, the association between Syria and the PFLP-GC appears to remain
a fundamental one that is not influenced by ephemeral issues. Even when
the organization has operated at the behest of Libya or Iran, it sought
Syrian approval for its associations and activities. Ali Duba himself was
reported to have been involved in contacts between the PFLP-GC and Libya,
when the latter was searching for a proxy to carry out retaliatory attacks
against the US following the April 1986 American air raid against military
and terrorist targets in Tripoli and Benghazi. Syria also apparently approved
of the active PFLP-GC role in the December 1988 bombing attack against
the Pan Am airliner, which was directed by Iran.

<P>Cumulative evidence linking the PFLP-GC to the Pan Am explosion brought
about appeals by the US to Assad to expel the organization from Syria.
Syria has been under pressure to dissociate itself from international terrorism
since late 1986, when the US and other Western states applied diplomatic
and economic sanctions following the disclosure in a London court of its
direct involvement in a plot to bomb an El Al airliner. Nevertheless, beyond
a few symbolic measures, Syria did not sever its ties with the groups it
sponsored. This, for example, was the case when Abu Nidal was ordered to
remove the headquarters of his organization from Damascus as a result of
American pressure applied to Syria: in 1987 the FRC merely moved to a Syrian
controlled area of Lebanon.

<P>Relations between the PFLP-GC and <B><U>Libya</U></B> have intensified
as Syria has bowed, however symbolically, to sanctions imposed by Western
states. The links had in fact been established earlier in - 1983 Qadhafi
arranged to train members of the PFLP-GC and other terrorist organizations
in Bulgaria. Since 1986, Libya has provided the PFLP-GC with funds and
logistical bases,

<P>An important factor in the relationship between the Front and Libya
was the organization's participation in the war in Chad. Libyan Air Force
officers trained PFLP-GC pilots for combat aircraft, and the latter took
an active part in the war in Chad. According to reports from September
1987 one of them was downed over Ndjamena, capital of Chad, while flying
a Libyan Tupolev-22 bomber. Jibril claimed that in 1987 the relationship
between his organization and Libya became unilateral: his men were fighting
for Libya in Chad, but Qadhafi ceased supplying the Front with money or
logistical support. However Libya was reported to paid the organization
for carrying out the December 1988 bombing assault against the Pan Am airliner
at the behest of Iran. Moreover, in 1987 Libyan government-owned companies
reportedly bought hang gliders for the PFLP-GC in France.

<P>In 1989 Qadhafi publicly renounced international terrorist activity,
declaring these attacks to be counterproductive to the Arab cause. Libya's
relations with Arafat's PLO mainstream have since improved while his ties
with extremist Palestinian elements have deteriorated. Thus Jibril was
ordered in September 1989 to close his offices in Tripoli, and Front members
were reported to have moved to Damascus.

<P>Links between the PFLP-GC and <B><U>Iran</U></B> became closer in December
1987, when Ahmed Jibril met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
in Tripoli, Libya, and conveyed his support "for the Islamic Revolution."
The relationship that has developed since then has apparently produced
political as well as operational manifestations.

<P>Thus Jibril took part in an Iranian attempt to create "an Islamic organization
for the liberation of Palestine,” aimed at replacing the PLO. First steps
in this direction were made in April 1988, when representatives of the
PFLP-GC, the <U>FRC</U> and the <U>Palestinian Islamic Jihad</U> discussed
the subject in Libya. In September 1989 a major conference was held in
Tehran to discuss plans for escalating the struggle against Israel. The
meeting was chaired by Velayati participants included Ahmed Jibril, leaders
of the Iranian-sponsored <U>Hizballah</U>, a leader of the Lebanese Sunni
militia Tawhid, and Abu Musa. A call for the establishment of a "formal
Palestinian-Iranian alliance" was issued by Jibril in December that year.

<P>An alliance of this sort was in fact formed in late 1988 between the
PFLP-GC, the FRC, and Hizballah It was reported that high ranking Hizballah
activists had discussed with the PFLP-GC plans to bomb American and French
targets. Yet by April 1990 this coalition which presumably was directed
by Iran - had still not found operational expression in the international
terrorist arena. We have noted that the developing links between Iran and
the PFLP-GC aroused internal opposition against Jibril. This may have affected
the scope of collaborative activities.

<P>The role of the PFLP-GC as a proxy for Iran was apparently manifested
in the most demonstrative way in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103. It is
generally believed that the bombing attack was carried out in retaliation
for the accidental downing by an American naval cruiser of an Iranian airliner
over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988, and that it was but one in a series
of attacks planned by the organization at the behest of Iran. The PFLP-GC
reportedly received a large sum of money from Iran and Libya in payment
for perpetrating the operation, in addition to a monthly financial stipend.
Throughout 1989 and early 1990 western security agencies made intensive
efforts to unequivocally uncover the identity of the sponsors and meanwhile,
cumulative evidence linked the PFLP-GC to the attack. One of the most substantive
indications was the discovery, on 0ctober 26, 1988 and in March 1989, of
three explosive devices similar to the one presumably used in the Pan Am
incident, in the possession of a PFLP-GC cell captured in West Germany.

<P>The PFLP-GC was also suspected of perpetrating the midair bombing of
the French UTA airliner on September 19, 1989 over Niger. That incident,
too, was presumed to have been carried out on behalf of Iran. According
to French sources, the explosion involved the same kind of device as those
found with the PFLP-GC members arrested in West Germany. French officials
also claimed that shortly before the attack, PFLP-GC operatives held talks
with pro-Iranian elements in Beirut and discussed schemes to deter France
from activating its naval force deployed off the Lebanese shore, against
the backdrop of the confrontation between Syria and General Aoun's forces.
Another probable cause for Iranian revenge against France was the latter's
alleged failure to fulfill its part of a deal concluded with Tehran in
1987, whereby it was to pay Iran in return for the release of French hostages
held by Hizballah.

<P>The links between the PFLP-GC and Iran bear a dangerous potential This
is an association between a well organized group dedicated to armed struggle,
and a state that is relatively insensitive to world criticism and sanctions.
However, because they are based upon pragmatic considerations, the relations
are vulnerable to two potential sources of change: internal opposition
within the organization to its links with Iran, and/or Syrian pressure
upon Jibril to halt his involvement in international terrorism and to cut
his links with Iran. This could happen for example, in the event of a shift
in the relationship between Iran and Syria.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Coordination with Additional Terrorist Organizations</FONT></B>
<BR>There are few indications as to operational links between the PFLP-GC
and other terrorist groups. This is most probably due to the organization's
preference through the years for close relationships with sovereign states
that provided it with logistical assistance. States were also involved
in some of the alliances formed between the PFLP-GC and other organizations,
such as Hizballah and the FRC.

<P>In June 1986 Jibril indicated that his organization maintained links
with the <U>Japanese Red Army (JRA)</U>. The JRA has also been associated
with the PFLP, and has been supported by Libya. For three successive years
after 1986 it carried out attacks against American and other western state
targets that coincided with the anniversary of the American air raid against
Libya. A Japanese newspaper reported in November 1989 that a JRA operative,
known as a personal acquaintance of Qadhafi delivered explosives to a "senior
member" of the PFLP-GC in Budapest, Hungary.

<P>On September 20, 1988 the <U>Red Army Faction (RAF)</U> attempted to
assassinate Hans Titmeyer, the West German finance minister. It claimed
responsibility for the attack under the name “Khaled Aker Unit." Aker,
a member of the PFLP-GC, was killed on November 25, 1987during an attack
on an IDF base in the north of Israel. There was no further evidence linking
the PFLP-GC to the RAF in general or to this incident in particular. At
the time of the attack, however, a PFLP-GC operational infrastructure already
existed in West Germany. Thus it is a matter of conjecture whether the
solidarity between the two organizations expressed in the claim of responsibility
by the RAF reflects a certain level of cooperation.

<P>In late 1989 it was reported that the PFLP-GC had established a network
of dormant operatives and arms caches in cooperation with the <U>Provisional
Irish Republican Army (PIRA)</U> in West Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.
A British journalist reported that as part of the logistical collaboration
between the organizations, a PFLP-GC cell in Germany supplied PIRA with
the Kalashnikov assault rifle used in an attack on a British soldier's
wife in September 7, 1989 in Dortmund, West Germany.

<P>Links with foreign terrorist organizations are not a crucial element
in PFLP-GC operational capacity, as it is apparently able to function with
the assistance provided by supportive states. Its essentially military
orientation also renders it indifferent to ideological solidarity as a
basis for links with foreign organizations.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>International Infrastructure and Activity</FONT></B>
<BR>The PFLP-GC has operated in the international arena since the early
1970s. All told, the volume of its activity in this sphere has been low:
by April 1990 the list of international incidents attributed to the organization
comprised some 26 actual and attempted attacks. Yet most of these were
highly sophisticated operations. They reflected considerable technical
expertise, as well as an inclination toward dramatic and lethal attacks.
The first international terrorist incident carried out by the organization
was the midair bombing on February 21, 1970 of a Swissair airliner destined
for Israel, killing all 47 passengers and crew. From then until August
1980, the organization was Involved in nine international terrorist attacks,
most of which werefoiled. Two explosive charges planted aboard airliners
did go off, and three additional attempts were thwarted. Also intercepted
were attempted bombings, parcel-explosives, a scheme to attack an Israeli
target in Denmark, and a plane hijacking.

<P>During the early '80s, no activity by the PFLP-GC in the international
arena was recorded. When it resumed international operations in the mid-'80s,
this was not motivated solely by a drive to escalate the Palestinian struggle
against Israel, as was the case in the 1970s. This time, the PFLP-GC served
interests alien to the Palestinian cause.

<P>Clearly, the heyday of PFLP-GC international activity was in the early
1970s. We have noted that the 12th PNC's decision in June 1974 to cease
international terrorism was accepted by Jibril, although it did not completely
end Front activity abroad. However, after 1974 the Front shifted the focus
of its operations to attacking Israel directly across its borders, including
occasional barricade-hostage and mass-killing attacks.

<P>During these years, as well as in the 1980s, the Front did not operate
squads within Israel. Its presence inside the Territories has also always
been relatively insignificant; since 1974, less than a dozen incidents
inside Israel have been recorded.

<P>Similarly, activity in the international arena has remained limited
quantitatively. We have noted that during 1985-1986 persons linked with
the PFLP-GC-albeit not members of the organization--were involved in terrorist
activity perpetrated in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. During the
years 1987-1989, Front operatives were directly involved in four international
attacks.

<P>PFLP-GC activity abroad is facilitated by an infrastructure in Western-Europe.
It was not dismantled as the Front reduced its involvement in international
terrorism in the 1970s, and dormant cells were maintained in several countries.
Locations for European bases were selected on the basis of the relative
freedom of movement provided by the authorities for Palestinian operatives
in certain states. Another important factor was the presence of a Palestinian
community.

<P>Thus, members of the organization were active in Greece and in Malta,
though only as logistical and exit bases for operatives, based on the authorities'
laxity toward the presence of Palestinian operatives there. The geographical
proximity of Malta to Libya made it even more attractive, and PFLP-GC members
who lived there frequently traveled to and from Libya. The bomb used in
the Pan Am explosion was apparently concealed in a suitcase and sent on
its fatal journey from a base in Malta.

<P>An operational base was also established in Yugoslavia. In an apartment
in Krusevac, near the Italian border, police found an arms cache consisting
of Semtex explosives, Soviet-made TNT, hundreds of detonators, and lengths
of fuse wire. Police investigators in Yugoslavia believe that bombs found
in possession of the PFLP-GC cell in West Germany were constructed with
materiel supplied from the Yugoslav arms cache.

<P>The PFLP-GC also established bases in Sweden and West Germany. In both
countries there are large communities of Palestinians seeking work or political
asylum that constitute a potential reservoir for recruitment of operatives
and a base for assistance and refuge.

<P>In 1987 a 34-member cell of the PFLP-GC was established in West Germany
by Hafez Dalkamoni, the organization's head of operations in Western Europe.
He entered West Germany early that year on a Syrian passport, and based
himself in Dusseldorf. The local authorities became aware of the existence
of the cell in September 1988, and put the suspected terrorists under telephone
surveillance. During the period until their arrest, contacts were made
between members of the cell and members of the PPSF living in Sweden, some
of whom had been involved in terrorist attacks in Scandinavian states during
1985-1986. Muhammad Abu Taleb, leader of the Swedish cell, and Marten Imandi,
a member of it, were apparently linked to the Dalkamoni cell.

<P>On October 26, 1988, when evidence gathered by the West Germany security
authorities indicated that the West German cell was about to act, a major
sweep of the hideouts of the cell's members was carried out. Fourteen activists
were detained, 12 of whom were released shortly thereafter. Hafez Dalkamoni
and another Palestinian remained in custody. The arrests provided information
on previously unsolved attacks perpetrated in Germany. According to Dalkamoni's
confession, he had already carried out two bomb attacks on US military
trains: on August 31, 1987 a bomb just missed a military train near Hedemunden;
and on April 26, 1988 a US military train traveling from Kessel to Goettingen
was hit.

<P>In the apartments of the detainees, including Dalkamoni's, police seized
arms, explosives and barometric fuses. The most interesting find was a
radio-cassette player loaded with explosives, and activated by a barometric
fuse. In March 1989 the German police found two similar devices in the
apartment of Dalkamoni's brother-in-law, a Palestinian who had acquired
German citizenship and lived in Neuss. The arrest of the cell, however,
did not prevent the disaster of the Pan Am incident scarcely two months
later, though it undoubtedly foiled additional planned attacks.

<P>The disclosure of links between Palestinians from Sweden and Dalkamonis
cell led to the detention of six Palestinians in October 1988 in Uppsala.
However, they were released shortly thereafter. In May 1989 the Swedish
police swept several apartments in three cities and detained suspects,
of whom four were charged and sentenced for a series of bomb attacks carried
out in Copenhagen on July 22, 1985 and in Stockholm on April 6, 1986 against
Jewish, Israeli and American targets. The four, members of the PPSF, included
Muhammad Abu-Taleb and Marten Imandi. As we have seen, these two had tangible
links with the Dalkamoni team in West Germany.

<P>It now emerged that Abu-Taleb had traveled in October 1988 to Malta
to organize the Pan Am bombing together with Dalkamoni, who was also in
Malta at the time.

<P>As noted earlier, too, the October 1989 attack against the UTA airliner
allegedly involved a charge that consisted of a Semtex explosive concealed
in a radio tape player, similar to those found in West Germany.

<P>The Front acquired important reinforcements when members of the <U>May-15
organization</U> joined its ranks. May-15 was established by <U>Muhammad
Al-Amri, alias Abu Ibrahim</U>, who was notorious for his expertise in
bombmaking. May-15 was dissolved in 1985 and its members joined Fatah and
the PFLP-GC. Although the PFLP-GC already possess basic know-how in the
construction of sophisticated bombs, it may be presumed that the former
May-15 members contributed their experience in preparing the sophisticated
charges found in possession of the West European network a few years later.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusions</FONT></B>
<BR>PFLP-GC involvement in terrorism has two major foci. The organization
has been active in Southern Lebanon and has occasionally staged cross-border
infiltration attempts into Israel. At the same time it maintains an infrastructure
abroad. While activity along Israel's borders falls within the framework
of the Palestinian armed struggle, activity in the international sphere
involves interests and implications that go beyond Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

<P>Activities at the behest of a foreign power have been a principal characteristic
of the PFLP-GC since it resumed operations on the international scene in
the second half of the '80s. Yet intra-Palestinian frictions and Israeli-Palestinian
conflict remain a driving force behind the organization. Thus, its present
low volume of activity in the international arena is linked with developments
associated with both background factors.

<P>The political process generated by the <I>intifada</I> has evoked sharp
condemnation by Palestinian leaders opposing Arafat and the PLO. Jibril
has openly attacked all parties concerned: Israel, the US and the PLO.
He is thought to have a prime interest in halting the political process.
Yet by mid-1990 the organization had not resorted to a concerted terrorist
campaign aimed at demonstrits rejection of the political moves advocated
by the PLO mainstream. This was probably linked with the rather unique
origins of the current process.

<P>Traditionally, the PFLP-GC and other groups and states that oppose the
very notion of a negotiated solution in Middle East have focused their
criticism on the PLO, and particularly on Arafat. The situation generated
by the <I>intifada</I> was different. The Declaration of Independence by
the 19th PNC was to a large extent a response by the PLO to the wishes
of the Palestinian populace in the Territories as expressed by the Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising. Opposing it meant confronting not
only Arafat and the PLO but also the very essence of the Palestinian uprising.

<P>Another reason for the low profile of international activity by the
PFLP-GC in 1989-90 derived from the organization's association with Syria.
Since late 1986 Damascus has been under international pressure to refrain
from direct involvement in blatant acts of international terrorism. This
placed an additional strain on Jibril's inclination to operate in the international
arena.

<P>All told, the probability that the PFLP-GC would resume large-scale
international terrorist activity seemed to depend upon two interrelated
factors: the extent of militancy of Iranian foreign policy, and Syria's
readiness to tolerate its client's potential for getting into embarrassing
situations. By mid-1990, the shadow of the Pan Am affair appeared to be
restraining both Iran and the PFLP-GC. The results of the official investigation
of the case could bear significant ramifications for the future activity
of the Front.
