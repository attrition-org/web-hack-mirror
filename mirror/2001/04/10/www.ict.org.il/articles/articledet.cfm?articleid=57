<P><B>Introduction&nbsp;</B>
<BR>The impact of the regional and international activity of the Sri Lankan
Tamil insurgents on the national security of Sri Lanka has not received
adequate attention by the domestic security, intelligence and foreign service
community. The wider threat posed to regional and international security
by Tamil insurgents - by the enhanced ideological, technological and financial
interaction with overseas insurgent groups - has also escaped their close
attention. Therefore, an understanding of the international infrastructure
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as well as their relationship
with the Tamil Diaspora, is vital for improving Sri Lankan, South Asian
and global stability and security.

<P>Although, I have been engaged in research and writing on the Sri Lankan
Tamil and Sinhala insurgencies during the past decade, I had the opportunity
to focus on their international operations, only during the past two years.
I conducted most of my research while resident at two research institutions
in the US: the Office of Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security
at the University of Illinois in 1994 and at the Center for International
and Security Studies at the University of Maryland in 1995. At Illinois,
I had the opportunity of working with Professor Stephen Cohen, a US expert
on South Asian security, and at Maryland, with Admiral Stansfield Turner,
one time head of the US intelligence community.

<P>My presentation is organized into three areas:

<ul>
<li>First, a brief history of the Tamil insurgents and the origins of their
international network.</li>

<li>Second, a description of the international network and its operation.</li>

<li>Third, the impact and the implications of the network, both on the security
of Sri Lanka and the world at large.
</li>
</ul>

<P><b>History of Insurgency</b>

<br>Contrary to popular perception, Tamil insurgency originated in northern
Sri Lanka in the early 1970s, during the United Front government, a coalition
of the SLFP, LSSP and CP. From 1970 onwards, there were a number of acts
of terrorism&nbsp; in the Jaffna peninsula. In February 1971, bombs were
thrown at the residence of the Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiappah. On March
11, a bomb was placed in his car. On August 27, 1972, Velupillai Prabhakaran,
the current leader of the LTTE, who was only 18 years of age, lobbed bombs
at a carnival organized by the mayor in the stadium in Jaffna. Once again
bombs were thrown at the stadium on September 17, and at the mayor’s residence
on December 19, 1972. On July 27, 1975, Duraiappah, who visited the Krishnan
temple at Ponnalai in his car, was assassinated by Prabhakaran and two
others. The mayor was the representative of the then United Front government
in Jaffna. His elimination was symbolic of&nbsp; the contempt the Tamil
insurgents had over the rule of Jaffna by a representative from Colombo.

<P>In their literature, the LTTE, the most formidable of Sri Lankan insurgent
groups, claim that they originated in 1972.&nbsp; However, they did not
begin to operate as an organization - the Tamil New Tigers (TNT) - until
1974. The leader was Chetti Tanabalasingham, a common criminal. Prabhakaran,
who was politically motivated from his younger days, developed the military
organization of the TNT and later the LTTE. Three early secretive linkages
the LTTE enjoyed with other Tamil political - militant organizations helped
the LTTE to develop its international component. They were tactical and
not enduring relationships.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Origins of the Network&nbsp;</B>
<BR>The LTTE link with the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) arose even
before the TULF obtained a formal mandate from the Tamil people for a separate
Tamil State in 1977. In the mid 1970s, the TULF leader Appapillai Amirthalingam
clandestinely supported the LTTE. Amirthalingam believed that his position
as the political leader of the Tamil people would be enhanced if he could
exercise control over the Tamil insurgent groups. The TULF helped the LTTE
to emerge as a powerful force. Two of its prominent youth wing members,
Uma Maheswaran, joined the LTTE as its chairman, and Urmila Kandiah, as
its first female member. On government stationary, Amirthalingam, as leader
of the parliamentary opposition, provided letters of reference to the LTTE
and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds.&nbsp; Amirthalingam,
also introduced N.S. Krishnan, to Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran, who later became
the first LTTE international representative, laid the foundation for LTTE
overseas activity <B>[<A HREF="#1">1</A>]</B>. Interestingly, it was Krishnan
who introduced the current LTTE theoretician and ideologue Anton Balasingham
to Prabhakaran. Balasingham, a former Tamil journalist and a translator
at the British High Commission in Colombo, was then a Ph.D. candidate writing
his dissertation on the psychology of Marxism at the South Bank Polytechnic.
The tutors at the polytechnic, (now known as the South Bank University)
still remember him as a bright but unusual student. Balasingham’s first
Jaffna Tamil wife, whom he loved very much, died of kidney failure in London.&nbsp;
Balasingham’s current wife Adele, an Australian citizen and a nurse by
professional training, is a prominent member of the women’s wing of the
LTTE.

<P>Another TULF parliamentarian that supported the LTTE was the then Chavakachcheri
MP V.N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the Inter
Parliamentary Union (IPU).&nbsp; Navaratnam introduced many influential
and wealthy Tamils living overseas to Tamil insurgent leaders. In one of
the first meetings in Oslo, Norway, Navaratnam, introduced the Polisario
representative to the LTTE. Polisario, a Moroccan insurgent group was ready
to cooperate with the LTTE.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The second organization that helped the LTTE to develop its international
component was the Eelam Revolutionary Organizers (EROS), erroneously and
better known as the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students founded
by Eliyathamby Ratnasabapathy <B>[<A HREF="#2">2</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Like most
ideologues, Ratnasabapathy too was a Marxist-Leninist. In Sri Lanka, he
had lived both in the north and in the plantations of the central hills
and was a LSSP supporter and a JVP sympathizer.&nbsp; After taking up residence
in London, he also formed the General Union of Eelam Students (GUES), modeled
on the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS). While GUES was the
student wing, EROS was the principal group. As a supporter of the Palestinian
cause, he had developed excellent relations with Sayed Hamami, the PLO
representative in London. Before Sayed was assassinated by Israeli operatives,
he helped Ratnasabapathy to develop links with Fatah, the military wing
of the PLO.&nbsp; Fatah offered a training opportunity to EROS. This was
a time when the insurgent groups shared their expertise and resources.
EROS shared the training offer with the LTTE. As a result in early 1977,
Vichweshwaran alias Visu of EROS (later LTTE) and Uma Maheswaran of LTTE
(later PLOTE), traveled to Lebanon and trained with Fatah.

<P>The third organization that helped the LTTE to develop its international
component was the Tamil Liberation Front, the precursor of the Tamil Liberation
Organization (TLO) <B>[<A HREF="#3">3</A>]</B>.&nbsp; The TLO, distinct
from the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), originated in London
in the mid-1970s. The dynamic leadership of TLO made it a powerful organization
within a short period of time. TLO organized a number of demonstrations,
rallies and protest marches opposing the Government of Sri Lanka. During
the second half of the 1970s, TLO was gradually absorbed by the LTTE. TLO
began to function as the international arm of the LTTE.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Rationale for the Network&nbsp;</B>

<P>The powerful presence of an international link was a major morale boost
for the Tamil insurgents in Sri Lanka.&nbsp; It was a form of recognition
of their struggle both domestically and internationally. The international
component enhances domestic survival and contributes to the resilience
of an organization. Although there was limited financial assistance until
the ethnic riots of July 1983, there were many Tamils who were sympathetic
towards the Tamil cause and waiting for an opportunity to make a contribution
for the advancement of Tamil nationalistic aspirations and goals. The ethnic
riots deeply wounded the sentiments and galvanized the Tamils as a community.
Past tragedies were brought to light and kept alive by the political leaders
on both sides.

<P>The injustices upon the minority as a community by the successive majority
dominated Colombo governments were rectified by two pacts - the Bandaranaike
- Chelvanayakam in 1957 and the Senanayake - Chelvanayakam in 1965. But
under pressure from sections of the majority community, the pacts were
abrogated. A series of ethnic riots - 1956, 1958, 1961, 1974, 1977, 1979,
1981 and 1983 - scarred the memories of a substantial segment Tamils. Many
who left Sri Lanka as victims of the riots were made to believe by Tamil
politicians that only a separate Tamil state can and would ensure permanent
protection.&nbsp; The TULF and several other Tamil political and insurgent
groups kept the campaign alive by bringing back bitter memories. The incessant
waves of riots that destroyed lives and property of the Tamils were highlighted.&nbsp;
Sinhala Sri, Sinhala Only Act, Sinhala colonization and standardization
of education that had antagonized the Tamils formed the basis of the conflict.<B>
[<A HREF="#4">4</A>]</B>

<P>Prior to July 1983, all efforts by Tamil insurgent groups and their
representatives to raise money overseas to sustain a war had been unsuccessful.
It was only after July 1983, with the exodus of over 100,000 Tamil refugees
and another equal number of displaced persons that gave birth to a distinct
Tamil Diaspora <B>[<A HREF="#5">5</A>]</B>.&nbsp; By the end of 1983, there
were over 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils in Tamil Nadu alone and this number
would swell up to nearly 200,000 with the escalation of the conflict. The
exodus to the West was equally intense. Many countries in the West, sympathetic
to the plight of the Sri Lankan Tamils would revise their immigration and
emigration policies vis-&agrave;-vis Sri Lanka. As a consequence, the number
of refugees, mostly economic but in the guise of political asylum seekers,
would bring the totality of the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora to over 450,000.

<P>Mid-1983 to mid-1987 witnessed Sri Lanka’s international image at its
lowest ebb. Despite having an open economy, a model democracy and a major
tourist destination, Sri Lanka’s international image suffered irreversibly.
TULF propaganda branded Sri Lanka as a state guilty of discrimination and
perpetrating genocide against its minority. Sri Lanka harped on the fact
that six of its top Ambassadors including those to the United Kingdom,
France and West Germany were Tamils. Colombo also said that the Inspector
General of Police, at least four Deputy Inspector Generals of Police, and
the Chief Justice were Tamils. But, no attempt was made by the government
to turn the events that would dampen the formation or hamper the operation
of the network. Counter propaganda by Sri Lankan missions overseas and
associations heightened the ethnic tensions overseas and polarized the
communities further. Sections of the Tamils marginally involved or disinterested
in communal politics were dragged into the center of a conflict in the
making.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Formation of the Network&nbsp;</B>

<P>Although the TULF politicians spearheaded this anti-Sinhala and anti-government
drive, it was not the TULF that reaped the benefits of their international
and domestic campaign to politicize and mobilize the Sri Lanka Tamils.
It was the Tamil insurgent groups that raised funds from a TULF - politicized
and mobilized Tamil Diaspora to fund their war effort for an independent
Tamil Eelam.&nbsp; Of the Tamil groups, the only group that developed consistency
in conducting&nbsp; propaganda against the government and the Sinhala majority
community and later even against the Government of India was the LTTE.
It was also the LTTE that developed the systematic organization to collect
money and use it with a high degree of honesty and efficiency to further
their political and military goals. The LTTE has displayed mastery in generating
funds from the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora spread over 50 countries. Soon
after the July riots of 1983, the LTTE international representative K.
Balasekeram, a radiographer working in a London hospital, convened a meeting
under the banner of the Eelam Solidarity Campaign. After many speakers
had aired their views, the voices from the audience asked, "What can we
do?" Balasekeram said, "Those who want to do something about the plight
of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka may leave your name and phone number."<B>[<A HREF="#6">6</A>]</B>&nbsp;
From that night, Balasekeram called many of the committed Tamils who had
come for the London meeting.&nbsp; After soliciting funds, Balasekeram
developed a system to follow up on the contributions pledged by the community.
Afterwards, he appointed a coordinator for each area and set out guidelines
to develop a state of the art finance generation operation throughout the
UK. His policy was not to request or receive a large donation at once,
but to socialize the Tamils to donating a small amount of money every month.
This became the first instance the LTTE collected money from a large public
gathering. The LTTE firmly believed in compartmentalization to secure the
vital element of secrecy.

<P>Attempts prior to 1983 had failed to raise funds from the Tamils as
a community although individuals did contribute to procure weaponry <B>[<A HREF="#7">7</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
Pre 1983 period witnessed the politicizing of the Tamils at a low level.&nbsp;
The first public organization of the Sri Lankan Tamil community to generate
funds had been formed in London in 1978. TULF’s Amirthalingam who was on
a world tour, together with a London based Eelam activist S.K. Vaikundavasan,
formed the Tamil Coordinating Committee (TCC).<B><I> </I>[<A HREF="#8">8</A>]</B>
The TCC was later used by the LTTE as a front organization to carry out
propaganda as well as to generate finance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>The UK Net&nbsp;</B>

<P>The UK has always been the heart of LTTE overseas political activity.
Since the riots of July 1983, the LTTE has expanded into Europe from London.
To make its position secure, the LTTE has either established, absorbed,
or infiltrated a number of LTTE, LTTE front or pro-LTTE organizations in
the UK. Some of them are the Tamil Information Center at Tamil House in
Romford Road in London, The Tamil Rehabilitation Organization in Walthamstow
in London, and the International Federation of Tamils (IFT)&nbsp; in Birchiew
Close in Surrey. From IFT, LTTE legal advisor N. Satyendran, a Cambridge
academic and son of the late S Nadesan Q.C., edits Network. IFT also publishes
a Tamil journal Kalathil. Among the other LTTE publications are Viduthalai
Puligal and Tamil Land. Other Tamil newspapers are Tamil Nation published
from Croydon, Surrey and Thamilan from Undine Street in London. More recently,
an LTTE front in London, publishes Hot Spring, a journal hitherto published
in the peninsula. The LTTE International Secretariat located at St. Katherine
Road has functioned continuously since its establishment in 1984. Among
the other organizations through which the LTTE operate are the London Tamil
Mandram and the World Saiva Council. The latter uses an address care of
the London Meikandaar Adheenam on King Edward Road.&nbsp; The LTTE also
maintains an information center in Albany Street, London, where the latest
news from Sri Lanka is provided to any caller. The Tamil Eelam British
Branch, providing this service could be accessed by calling 0171 387 4339.
There are similar news services in a number of countries from Germany to
the US.

<P>From the UK, the LTTE feeds propaganda to its offices and cells throughout
Europe, North America and elsewhere. In turn the funds collected are transferred
to a number of LTTE and cover bank accounts. In charge of the LTTE propaganda
and fund raising is John Christian Chrysostom alias Lawrence Tilagar, the
international representative of the LTTE<B><I> </I>[<A HREF="#9">9</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
With him, dedicated LTTE leaders from Shanthan, Shegar and Ramasar in London,
Murali in Geneva, Rudrakumaran in New York and Suresh in Toronto work day
and night. The LTTE propaganda and fund raising network is superior to
other extant networks such as Hamas, Hezbollah, Kashmiris, or the Basques.
Today, in the North Atlantic countries alone, there are over 40 Sri Lankan
Tamil newspapers, of which over 80% are either managed by the LTTE or their
front organizations. If the LTTE is unable to infiltrate a Sri Lankan Tamil
newspaper, it would call the stores that sell the newspaper not to sell
it or would call the Tamil public to boycott it.&nbsp; In mid 1996, the
LTTE decided to kill Manchari, a Tamil newspaper edited by D.B.S. Jeyaraj
in Canada. Therefore, the writ of the&nbsp; LTTE extends beyond the LTTE
dominated areas in Sri Lanka, into distant theaters where they have made
a significant political, economic and a militant presence.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Dynamics of the Network&nbsp;</B>

<P>To build support for their domestic struggle as well as to consolidate
their position overseas, the LTTE has developed relationships clandestine
with foreign insurgent groups. By studying how other revolutionary groups
operate overseas, the LTTE learnt the importance of propaganda material.
London, the hub of revolutionary representatives, cells and offices, helped
the LTTE to realize this dimension. In 1978, the LTTE produced its first
leaflet for international distribution - it was for a conference in Cuba
where a large group of revolutionary leaders would meet. In 1978, a Sri
Lankan delegation left to attend the 11th World Youth Conference in Havana,
Cuba. The three member TULF delegation was joined by a LTTE representative
who had hitherto studied in the Soviet Union. Hoping to join them, the
then UK based LTTE international representative N.S. Krishnan traveled
with LTTE literature from London to Madrid in Spain to obtain a visa for
Cuba. The visa was not granted and Krishnan had to return to London. However,
he managed to courier the propaganda material to Havana, in time for the
meeting.

<P>From 1977 onwards the LTTE international network made inroads to countries
where there was a Tamil presence. From the mid-1970s onwards, the Tamil
militant structures steadily grew in the West, with its nucleus in London.
The linkages were mostly confined to the Middle East, for military development,
and to Europe and elsewhere like Nigeria, Yemen and&nbsp; Zambia for financial
assistance. By the 1980s, Tamil militant representatives had traveled far
and wide. The Arab and Islamic world was important but so were countries
where Tamils lived, worked and earned in substantial number. They were
Libya, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey and Yemen.
They also had substantial contacts with Cyprus and Greece. The government
in Colombo failed to keep track of Tamil political activities overseas.
The United National Party government of J.R. Jayewardene that came to power
in 1977 reorganized the intelligence apparatus and as a consequence, intelligence
and data collection and analysis on Tamil insurgency suffered. In 1984,
one year after the riots of 1983, when the seasoned operatives were called
back, Tamil network overseas by then had grown substantially <B>[<A HREF="#10">10</A>]<I>.</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Very few in the national security apparatus at that time realized the importance
of monitoring activities of the Tamil insurgents overseas, including the
vibrant Tamil Diaspora - insurgent link.

<P>Although a number of Tamils left Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 1977
riots, they were not sufficiently politicized or mobilized to make financial
contributions to the LTTE but this dynamic changed after mid-1983. The
expansion of the LTTE network after 1983 was meteoric. The LTTE focused
not only in developing relationships with neighboring India, Tamil communities
overseas, but other revolutionary groups. But unlike other Tamil groups,
the LTTE was mindful in every step they took both domestically and internationally.
Even in their relationship with India, the LTTE ensured that their other
relationships did not suffer. While the LTTE developed new contacts, they
also managed to keep the old contacts alive. Until late 1986, Prabhakaran
did not wish to antagonize India but neither did he wish to rely on India
totally. This led the LTTE to develop alliances with other groups outside
India and thereby not become totally dependent on India. However, many
of the alliances the LTTE developed during the early years, just like those
developed in the subsequent years, were not permanent friendships.&nbsp;
They were temporary and tactical relationships, very similar in content
and context developed with India from 1983 to 1987 and with the Premadasa
Administration from 1989 to 1990. Prabhakaran never compromised his avowed
dream of Tamil Eelam. Prabhakaran’s primary task and primary goal was to
advance his objectives and reach his goal. So, the alliances would not
last for more than a few years.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>LTTE Foreign Policy&nbsp;</B>

<P>Having established political links with revolutionary regimes and revolutionary
groups quite early in their history, the LTTE realized the importance of
such linkages. Gaddhafi, Assad, and Khomeni were their heros in a series
of anti-US and anti-Israeli demonstrations in the peninsula in the mid
1980s. These regimes had pledged support to LTTE representatives while
maintaining a relationship with Colombo<B> [<A HREF="#11">11</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
However, the LTTE was cautious not to have contacts with organizations
for the mere sake of establishing links because that would draw the attention
of foreign security and intelligence agencies. Therefore, if ever the LTTE
established links, it was based either on advancing mutual interests or
for military, political, economic or diplomatic gain.

<P>Every insurgent group passes through a critical phase where they require
either an external sanctuary and or external assistance to survive. The
LTTE was no exception. Geopolitics as well as domestic compulsions led
India to support the Tamil insurgents of Sri Lanka. Geographically, India
is only 22 miles away from the Jaffna peninsula. It is one hour by speed
boat. Although Tamil insurgents benefited from this natural external base
from the early 1970s, it was not until the riots of July 1983 that India
became an active base for the Tamil groups to grow in number, strength
and operational capability and capacity.

<P>The India - Sri Lanka Tamil insurgency relationship has its origins
in the 1970s. The initial contact between the Tamil Nadu government and
Sri Lankan Tamil activists was established in 1972. A delegation from the
Tamil Manavi Peravi, a group of Tamil students who believed in the armed
struggle and committed towards securing an independent Tamil state in Sri
Lanka, traveled to Madras and met E.V.R. Periya, the then Tamil Nadu leader
<B>[<A HREF="#12">12</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Periya told the four man delegation,
"If you are unhappy in Sri Lanka come to South India. We will give you
enough land to cultivate." During the 1970s, Tamil youth activists used
Tamil Nadu as a sanctuary to evade arrest from the Sri Lanka police - this
included Prabhakaran and many other politically as well as criminally active
youth.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Relationship with India&nbsp;</B>

<P>From the late 1970s, the LTTE developed links with a number of Tamil
Nadu political groups - they were comparatively small in organization and
membership. The most significant of them were Dravida Kazhagam headed by
Veramani, the Kamraj Congress headed by Nedumaran and the Pure Tamil Movement
headed by Perinchintanarayanan. To date, the leaders as well as cadres
remain strong supporters of the LTTE.&nbsp; Veeramani called a meeting
of all his key party organizers throughout Tamil Nadu and asked them to
support the LTTE. Nedumaran wrote a biography of Prabhakaran. Perinchintanarayanan
gave his property for the use of the LTTE.&nbsp; Thereafter, the LTTE developed
excellent relations with M.G. Ramachandran and M. Karunanidhi, who succeeded
each other as chief ministers.

<P>Although Tamil insurgents had established a few training camps in Tamil
Nadu in 1982, there was no official assistance from the Central Government
of India prior to August 1983. In the eyes of many Indian hard-liners,
Sri Lanka since 1977 had stepped out of the non aligned orbit and had become
an ally of the West. There were Israeli intelligence operatives, British
counter insurgency experts, South African mercenaries, and rumors about
offering Trincomalee, one of the finest deep water harbors to the US navy.&nbsp;
Sri Lanka had good relations with Pakistan and China, two countries that
had fought border wars with India and they were in the process of stepping
up military assistance to Colombo. Further, President J.R. Jayewardene
of Sri Lanka did not enjoy with Premier Indira Gandhi the same warm relationship
he had with her father, Premier Jawaharlal Nehru.&nbsp; After Premier Indira
Gandhi, also the leader of the powerful Congress (I) Party, took a policy
decision to support Sri Lankan northern insurgency from August 1983. The
need to have leverage over Colombo was adequately demonstrated by the Research
and Analysis Wing (RAW), the agency also responsible for advancing India’s
secret foreign policy goals. Within her inner circle, the decision was
justified. Geopolitics and domestic compulsions validated the rationale.
The Third Agency of RAW, a supra intelligence outfit, was entrusted with
the task. Within a year, the number of Sri Lanka Tamil training camps in
Tamil Nadu mushroomed to 32. By mid 1987, over 20,000 Sri Lankan Tamil
insurgents had been provided sanctuary, finance, training and weapons either
by the central government, state government of Tamil Nadu or by the insurgent
groups themselves. While most of the initial training was confined to Indian
military and paramilitary camps in Uttara Pradesh, specialized training
were imparted by the Indian instructors attached to RAW to Sri Lankan insurgents
in New Delhi, Bombay and Vishakhapatnam <B>[<A HREF="#13">13</A>]</B><I>.</I>&nbsp;
The most secretive training was conducted in Chakrata, north of Dehra Dun,
India’s premier military academy for training service personnel, where
RAW had also imparted training to Bangladesh, Pakistan and Tibetan dissidents
<B>[<A HREF="#14">14</A>]</B>.

<P>With the Indo-Lanka Accord of July 1987, RAW assistance culminated.
Rajiv Gandhi ordered the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to fight the
LTTE, when it went back on its pledge to surrender its weapons. The LTTE-IPKF
war, apparently deprived the LTTE of its invaluable base, India. But, Tamil
Nadu assistance to the LTTE continued even after M.G. Ramachandran’s death
in December 1987. Tamil Nadu State assistance under the Karunanidhi Administration,
despite the presence of the IPKF, continued for the LTTE. Although the
LTTE was at war with India, Tamil Nadu still remained LTTE’s main source
of supplies.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>The Indian Net&nbsp;</B>

<P>Throughout the IPKF episode and until Rajiv Gandhi assassination in
1991, the LTTE continued to maintain a substantial presence in India. When
the law enforcement agencies stepped up surveillance, the LTTE moved a
bulk of its cadres from Tamil Nadu to other towns such as Mysore, Bangalore
and Bombay.&nbsp; Even at the height of the IPKF - LTTE confrontation,
the LTTE had twelve sections in India to manage:

<P>(1) Intelligence
<BR>(2) Communications
<BR>(3) Arms Production
<BR>(4) Procurement of explosives
<BR>(5) Propaganda
<BR>(6) Political work
<BR>(7) Food and essential supplies
<BR>(8) Medicines
<BR>(9) Fuel supplies
<BR>(10) Clothing
<BR>(11) Transport
<BR>(12) Finance and currency conversion

<P>The LTTE had also converted Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu, and nine
other Tamil Nadu districts, into centers for war supplies to the LTTE.
Each center was linked by a sophisticated wireless network. Individual
units carried sanyo walkie talkie sets. The centers of war supplies and
other activities were <B>[<A HREF="#15">15</A>]</B>:

<P>(1) Dharmapuri: Procurement of explosives
<BR>(2) Coimbatore: Arms and ammunition manufacturing

<P><B>Implications for India&nbsp;</B>

<P>The LTTE-India nexus did not secure the geopolitical security New Delhi
needed from Sri Lanka. It weakened Indian as well as Sri Lankan domestic
security. In many ways, the presence of a foreign military strengthened
the fighting spirit of LTTE and weakened the anti-terrorist capability
of the Sri Lankan forces, then engaged in an anti-subversive campaign in
the South <B>[<A HREF="#16">16</A>]</B>.&nbsp; The organization gained
mastery of guerrilla warfare by fighting the fourth largest military in
the world. The LTTE suffered heavy causalities but replenished their ranks
and gained a confidence paralleled by the Viet Cong and the Afghan mujahidin.
LTTE also innovated new weapons, mostly projectiles and mines. Johnny mine,
the anti-personnel mine invented by Prabhakaran, has at least claimed 5,000
Indian and Sri Lankan war causalities.&nbsp; Many Tamil Nadu political
leaders from Nedumaran to Gopalasamy and Ramakrishnan visited the LTTE
jungle base - known as the one four base complex over the years - and expressed
solidarity with Prabhakaran.

<P>The role of the IPKF in Sri Lanka became a politically sensitive issue.
When the IPKF returned to India, under the National Front government of
V.P. Singh, the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi did not visit
the port of Madras to welcome the Indian soldier. Even after the IPKF departed
the LTTE continued to maintain excellent relations with Tamil Nadu politicians.
The LTTE had managed to preserve Tamil Nadu as a critical base by retaining
the goodwill of the Tamil Nadu leaders.

<P>In fact, when the LTTE hit teams under the one eyed Jack Sivarasan assassinated
the anti-LTTE EPRLF leader Padmanabha and his colleagues in Tamil Nadu,
chief minister Karunanidhi asked the Tamil Nadu police and the state agencies
to turn a blind eye. A few months later, the LTTE used the very same infrastructure
of the LTTE in Tamil Nadu to kill Rajiv Gandhi <B>[<A HREF="#17">17</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
The LTTE penetration of the Tamil Nadu polity was so good that a decision
reached at a high level meeting comprising intelligence agencies in New
Delhi about anti-LTTE operations was conveyed to the LTTE within 24 hours.
Investigations revealed that the culprit was the then Tamil Nadu Home Secretary
and at the instruction of Karunanidhi. The dismissal of Karunanidhi did
not prevent the LTTE from continuing to operate in Tamil Nadu. The LTTE
made a statement during the subsequent Jayalalitha Administration, "If
the Tamil Nadu leadership cannot support the LTTE, at least we expect them
to be neutral to the LTTE." This meant that LTTE operations should continue
unhindered in the state of Tamil Nadu.

<P>In retrospect, the LTTE - India relationship has been one of love and
hate. It is a relationship that will have its ups and downs but a relationship
that will nevertheless continue. Despite the fact that the LTTE eliminated
Rajiv Gandhi, the last of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty, there will always be
a segment of the Tamil Nadu leaders and people that will support the LTTE.&nbsp;
The contradiction stems from India’s own structure - the diversity within
India, particularly, the disparity in culture between the Indian Tamils
and the rest of India’s polity. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was imperative
for the LTTE. If the LTTE did not, the IPKF that withdrew would have returned
heralding another period of bloody fighting. Prabhakaran’s calculus was
right. As a leader, he had done his duty by his rank and file. By assassinating
Rajiv Gandhi, he prevented the reintroduction of the IPKF to Sri Lanka
<B>[<A HREF="#18">18</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Even for Prabhakaran, it would have
been a painful decision. Antagonizing India at the southernmost point of
peninsular India meant the permanent closure of the door for creating Tamil
Eelam and Prabhakaran becoming its ruler.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Non-LTTE Actors&nbsp;</B>

<P>While the LTTE international network grew from strength to strength,
the activities of other Tamil insurgent groups such as PLOTE, TELO, EPRLF
and EROS dwindled. There were three reasons for it.

<P>First, their ideology was strictly not Tamil nationalism but a mixture
of Marxist-Leninism <B>[<A HREF="#19">19</A>]</B>.&nbsp; The LTTE had made
the transition from Marxist Leninism to Tamil nationalism despite the fact
that Anton Balasingham was a confirmed Marxist-Leninist and had extensively
written and published on the subject. Whipping up Tamil nationalism and
fighting the Sri Lankan security forces appealed to sections of the Tamil
community over ideological indoctrination and limited or no action with
only visions of a mass revolution.

<P>Second, with the Indo-Lanka Accord of July 1987 and the introduction
of 100,000 Indian peace keeping troops to Sri Lanka, all the Tamil insurgent
groups entered the political mainstream except the LTTE. Although at first
it appeared unrealistic to fight India, segments of the Tamil Diaspora
were committed to supporting the armed struggle of the LTTE against the
IPKF. Through concerted propaganda, the LTTE had projected into the minds
of the Tamil Diaspora, that the LTTE could even fight India. Prior to mid
1987, the LTTE was the only group that projected itself both militarily
and politically as capable of delivering an independent Tamil Eelam. Although
many Tamils detested the IPKF - LTTE confrontation (because India had been
a traditional ally of Sri Lankan Tamils) IPKF civilian killings highlighted
by the LTTE international propaganda machinery generated resentment against
India and the pro-Indian Sri Lankan Tamil groups and generated support
for the LTTE.

<P>Third, LTTE was the only group that systematically lobbied for Tamil
Diaspora assistance and developed the organization to sustain international
activity.&nbsp; When the fighting against the IPKF resumed, the network
was already in place. Although the proposition was unrealistic to many,
the Tamil Diaspora could not refuse the LTTE it had been supporting and
funding for years. The rival Tamil groups such as PLOTE, EPRLF, TELO, EROS
and ENDLF did not have the international organization.

<P>It must be recalled that PLOTE started its international activities
with a bang soon after the riots of July 1983. In fact, they purchased
the first ship, Palavan. In 1984, a PLOTE delegation visited Mauritius
and received a red carpet welcome from the government of Androo Jauganath.
On that delegation with Uma Maheswaran was Dharmalingam Siddharthan, the
son of a TULF parliamentarian, and currently the leader of PLOTE.&nbsp;
Further, PLOTE had the largest number of cadres living in India. According
to modest estimates, there were at least 10,000 PLOTE cadres in Tamil Nadu
alone. Initially, TELO enjoyed greater patronage than the LTTE in India.&nbsp;
TELO also had better training facilities at the beginning. But the LTTE
checkmated all these groups by keeping their numbers small and a tight
control to maintain discipline. Ruthlessness and efficiency forced the
LTTE to ban all the other Tamil groups and hunt their leaders and cadres
from 1984 onwards. Today, the LTTE claims that they are the sole representatives
of the Tamil people, not only domestically but internationally, thereby
dampening even the activities of rival Tamil groups overseas. Coercion
is not an uncommon tool among the LTTE cadres operating overseas vis-&agrave;-vis
Tamil civilians. These international developments demonstrated the ever
changing dynamic between LTTE domestic policy and its impact on their international
activity.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Finance Generation&nbsp;</B>

<P>Modern insurgent groups are developing the ability to raise funds in
one theater, operate in another and fight in a third theater. Although
the international intelligence and security community has yet to focus
on the LTTE finance generation, the LTTE is the archetype <B>[<A HREF="#20">20</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
By late 1995, 40% of LTTE war budget was generated from overseas <B>[<A HREF="#21">21</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
Since the loss of Jaffna peninsula in early 1996, 60% of the LTTE war budget
is being generated from overseas. The LTTE has been engaged in a number
of ventures that continue to bring them a massive revenue. It is likely
that funds generated this way will surpass the funds generated domestically
or internationally from the Tamil Diaspora. This is not a trend confined
to the LTTE but to other transnational groups as well. But the LTTE is
a trendsetter in this arena. The LTTE has invested in stock and money markets,
real estate and in restaurants throughout the West and East. Starting with
restaurants in Tamil Nadu and Paris in 1983, the LTTE developed its business
acumen. Thereafter, restaurants sprang up from London to Toronto and Cambodia.
Today, the LTTE has a large number of shops in a number of capitals, cities
and towns. They sell LTTE videos, newspapers and Asian spice. LTTE has
also invested in a number of farms, finance companies and in other high
profit ventures.

<P>Trading in gold, laundering money and trafficking narcotics bring the
LTTE substantial revenue that is needed to procure sophisticated weaponry
<B>[<A HREF="#22">22</A>]</B>.&nbsp; The SAM missiles procured from Cambodia
cost the LTTE US $ 1 million a piece <B>[<A HREF="#23">23</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
The gold that is collected in Jaffna - initially two sovereigns from each
family for the war budget - is melted and ingots are formed and transported
across the Palk Straits to Tamil Nadu. The ingots are sold by LTTE male
and female couriers in Tiruchi, Coimbatore and Bombay markets. With the
help of Thanjavur smugglers, the money is ploughed back to procure war
materials. Supplies purchased in India are smuggled back to Sri Lanka from
the Ramanathapuram to Thanjavur coastline to Jaffna and Talaimannar. The
LTTE money laundering activities is not very different to the systems used
by the Latin American narcotics cartels <B>[<A HREF="#24">24</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
Money is invested in legitimate ventures that makes it difficult for security
and intelligence agencies to monitor their investments, accounts, transfers
and investments.&nbsp; Although, the LTTE narcotic trafficking operations
remain highly secretive, Western and Asian security and intelligence agencies
have since recently made some&nbsp; significant detection’s from the Philippines
to Germany and from Italy to Canada. It is believed that the LTTE transports
heroin on board LTTE owned ships from Myanmar to Europe<B> [<A HREF="#25">25</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
The LTTE also has their own fleet of vehicles in many countries from Tamil
Nadu to Ontario. They also play a role in providing passports, other papers,
and also engage in human smuggling.

<P>Like the Middle Eastern groups, notably the Hamas and the Hezbollah,
the illegal and the legal components of the LTTE operation for the generation
of finances overlap. Today, when money is collected by the Tamil Rehabilitation
Organization (TRO), the rehabilitation wing of the LTTE, it is well known
among the donors that the money is in fact spent not only on rehabilitation
but also to procure weapons<B> [<A HREF="#26">26</A>]</B>.&nbsp; It is
an unwritten understanding both among the collectors and donors. During
their early years, almost all the Tamil insurgent groups were totally dependent
on robberies, extortion (they use the term expropriation) and donations.
Later the Tamil groups developed a taste for soliciting funds overseas
from individuals and organizations. They were effective in organizing food
festivals, film shows or other cultural activities. From LTTE controlled
and dominated areas, they also began to levy a tax. The LTTE profit considerably
from businesses and trade. They also tax through immigration and emigration,
transportation of commodities to and from the northeast and wherever money
changes hands in substantial quantity and frequency. Karikalan, the head
of the political wing for the Eastern province, earned a reputation among
Colombo-based foreign missions and development-oriented International Non
Governmental Organizations (INGOs) working in the northeast for having
approached their field representatives to make donations. At one point,
the TRO, received a substantial donation from the Government of Germany
<B>[<A HREF="#27">27</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Thereafter, Karikalan would take a
special interest in demanding for contributions from either the Colombo-based
missions or INGOs.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Shipping Network&nbsp;</B>

<P>LTTE overseas department for clandestine operations, headed by Kumaran
Padmanathan, is also responsible for managing the highly secretive shipping
network<B> [<A HREF="#28">28</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Padmanathan, a product of
the Jaffna campus, uses over 20 aliases and an equal number of passports.
This organ of the LTTE, also known as the KP department, has mostly militarily
untrained cadres. Even Padmanathan has not been trained militarily. This
makes the operation of their department much easier. There are virtually
no records of members of this department in the files of domestic and foreign
security and intelligence agencies.&nbsp; But they are trained in other
skills from forging to gun running, secret communication to investing.
KP department is also responsible for managing the LTTE shipping network.
The LTTE shipping network, that has reached a high degree of proficiency,
is a model for other insurgent groups.

<P>Except for the PLO and the IRA, the LTTE is the only insurgent group
that owns and operates a fleet of deep sea going ships<B><I> </I>[<A HREF="#29">29</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
Equipped with sophisticated radar and inmarsat for communication, the LTTE
built its fleet from small beginnings. Today, the LTTE ships communicate
with a land based inmarsat in Sri Lanka. The LTTE ships play a vital role
in supplying explosives, arms, ammunition and other war related material
to the theater of war.

<P>The LTTE deep sea going operations began in 1984 after the purchase
of Cholan from Singapore. Hitherto, the LTTE had only a naval capability
to shuttle between India and Sri Lanka and a capacity to charter vessels.
To finalize the Cholan purchase, Prabhakaran personally visited Singapore
and Malaysia. During this period, the LTTE was also building a vessel called
Kadalpura on the Kerala coast<B> [<A HREF="#30">30</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Soranalingam,
a double engineer, with expertise in aircraft/airframe and marine engineering
supervised the construction <B>[<A HREF="#31">31</A>]</B>.&nbsp; From 1985
onwards, the LTTE developed its fleet rapidly by actively purchasing vessels.
Tamil insurgents had decided to purchase their own vessels after experiencing
difficulties of chartering vessels. From 1983 to 1985, they lost into the
hands of authorities, three vessels carrying significant consignments.
In Salonika, Greece, a Liberian registered plane with a load of arms, in
Ras Garib, Egypt, the ship IVYB with two and a half tonnes of armaments
ran aground, and in Madras, Palavan was seized with Chinese weapons sold
out of Hong Kong by Alexander Urban, a Czech born Australian operating
out of Singapore.

<P>Tamil militants have purchased explosives and weapons from a wide variety
of sources - governments, from North Korea to Myanmar and the Ukraine,
and from middlemen operating from Europe to Asia and the Middle East.&nbsp;
Intelligence agencies with a global reach continue to monitor LTTE shipping
activity quite closely but operationally could detect or prevent less than
20% of the weapon consignments from reaching the target. In fact, Illyana,
an LTTE ship that unloaded weapons off Mulativu in October 1987, was monitored
by Indian vessels entering the Rangoon harbor. Similarly Indian submarines,
ships and aircraft’s have tracked LTTE ships over the years. Aware of this,
LTTE has yet managed to keep most of its shipping fleet intact. The deceptive
shipping operations, indigenously developed, avoids detection and surveillance.
Yahata transporting weapons and explosives changed its name to Ahat by
painting off the first and the last letters of the ship’s name upon nearing
the South Asian wars.

<P>After the LTTE lost Tamil Nadu as a semi-covert base in late 1987, the
LTTE established a permanent naval base in Twante, an island off Myanmar,
until late 1995. This was vital, because a transshipment point, determines
sound logistics to security. While operating out of Myanmar, the LTTE also
used Thailand, particularly the Pukhet area, as a back up base. Today,
a bulk of LTTE shipping activity is carried out of South East Asia. The
LTTE will always need a naval base in South Asia or South East Asia for
its operations in the Central Indian Ocean Region.

<P>For generating revenue, the ships also transports fertilizer, timber,
flour, rice paddy, sugar, cement and other commercial goods <B>[<A HREF="#32">32</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
During the PA-LTTE peace talks, there were three shipments. The ship Sweene
transported 50 tons of TNT and 10 tons of RDX purchased from a chemical
plant from Nicholave, a Black Sea port in the Ukraine. Only 300 to 400
kg of this quantity was used in early 1996 to devastate the heart of Colombo’s
financial district by the LTTE.&nbsp; Similarly, a consignment of SAM-7s
procured from Cambodia via Thailand reached Sri Lanka. This was the most
expensive military cargo, the LTTE had ever transported.&nbsp; On board
was Padmanathan himself. The details of the third consignment are not yet
known. To save high registration costs, the ships are registered in the
flag giver countries of Panama, Honduras and Liberia, affectionately known
as "Pan-ho-lib."

<P>The unchecked expansion of the LTTE fleet has implications for regional
and international security. From late 1983 to mid 1987, it was a belief
shared by Sri Lankan defense, security and intelligence official that as
long as India was used as an external base by the Sri Lankan Tamil militant
groups, it would be impossible to destroy let alone pressurize the LTTE
<B>[<A HREF="#33">33</A>]</B>.&nbsp; During that formative period, the
LTTE, was dependent largely on Tamil Nadu for its supplies to northern
Sri Lanka.&nbsp; After the decline of official support from India, the
LTTE has successfully replicated that network internationally. Instead
of an hour long speed boat across the Palk Straits, deep sea going ships
transport supplies procured throughout the world for the LTTE.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B>Evolution of the LTTE&nbsp;</B>

<P>With the expansion of the LTTE network overseas, the LTTE domestic structure
has grown in strength and sophistication <B>[<A HREF="#34">34</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
But, some features of the LTTE never changed. Despite several offers for
international mediation and attractive propositions both by India and Sri
Lanka to resolve the political question, the LTTE remained rigid in its
stand on Tamil Eelam.

<P>In many ways, the LTTE did not evolve but revolved. At the heart of
it was Prabhakaran, an innovative, calculating and a ruthless military
genius.&nbsp; Although, he subsequently developed political sophistication,
he never compromised his faith in violence as a means to reach a political
goal. Unlike most other groups, the LTTE began as a military organization
but in time developed the political structures. Like most revolutionary
movements of today, the LTTE is not a political organization that developed
a military capability. History has shown that it is a near impossibility
for organizations that are inherently militant to enter the political mainstream.
The leadership of such organizations think and act primarily militarily
and secondarily politically.&nbsp; By virtue of their structural compulsions,
such organizations prefer to fight continuously and win militarily. Such
organizations feel uncomfortable to compete in a political environment.

<P>At leadership level, Prabhakaran maintains tight control. He is the
final authority on each and every major issue. Prabhakaran’s decision has
always gone unchallenged.&nbsp; If Prabhakaran is killed, will the LTTE
die? Examining similar organizations, particularly the capability of their
middle level leadership, after the death or arrest of their senior leaders,
provide a vital clue. Did the JVP or the Sendero Luminoso die after the
death of Wijeweera or the capture of Guzman?&nbsp;<B> [<A HREF="#35">35</A>]</B>

<P>Although the death of Prabhakaran will be a massive blow to the LTTE,
the middle level leadership of the LTTE is equally or more motivated than
its senior level leadership. History shows that organizations like the
LTTE cannot be easily eradicated.&nbsp; Despite their inability to meet
their avowed goals and the massive suffering they have brought upon the
Tamil public, segments of the Tamil&nbsp; people still believe in them
and support them. For some, particularly for those who had lost a loved
one during an ethnic riot or killed by a soldier, Prabhakaran is a demi-god.

<P><P>As much as the moderate Tamil politicians have failed, successive governments
in Colombo have not done their best for Sri Lanka. Even the best of Sri
Lankan leaders have faltered. Colombo has failed to understand the aspirations
of the Tamil people, the equation between the Tamil insurgents and the
Tamil public, and finally, the importance of non military dimensions of
counter insurgency. These dynamics have also impeded the government from
dampening the Sri Lankan Tamil insurgent - Diaspora link. Governments have
miserably failed to develop and implement non-military strategies primarily
counter propaganda among the Diaspora and in the LTTE dominated areas of
the northeast. To what degree has the Diaspora helped the LTTE to become
resilient? The expansion of the Diaspora, the backbone of LTTE finance
generation, has helped the LTTE to develop its range of contacts for procuring
weapons too. What will be the outcome of allowing a Diaspora to expand
and root in this manner? Will the LTTE become more confident and less amenable
towards negotiation?

<P>The expansion of the LTTE network overseas has brought them closer in
contact with other insurgent groups. The LTTE has developed ideological,
financial and technological linkages with other insurgent groups. Technologically,
the LTTE has established links with the Assamese ULFA, Punjabi Sikh insurgents,
Andhara Peoples War Group, the Kashmir mujahidin and several groups within
and outside the region. Such groups exchange and purchase weaponry from
diverse sources thereby contravening the established international arms
control conventions and agreements.&nbsp; As insurgent group develop their
structures to raise funds in one location, operate from another location
and fight in a third location, law enforcement agencies of governments
are constrained from conducting extra-territorial operations.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Destabilizing Force?&nbsp;</B>

<P>Is the LTTE a destabilizing force in South Asia? Does LTTE interaction
with foreign insurgent groups contribute to the instability and insecurity
of nation-states beyond Sri Lanka? The region is fed from West, Central
and South East Asia and Europe by small arms.&nbsp; In 1994, 50 tones of
TNT and 10 tones of RDX were sold by a chemical plant in Ukraine to the
LTTE. Did the LTTE share a fraction of these explosives with&nbsp; their
South East Asian and South Asian counterparts? In 1995, a consignment of
Chinese manufactured Surface to Air Missiles were sold by a group of corrupt
Cambodian generals across the Cambodian - Thai border with the knowledge
of a section of the corrupt Thai military. The LTTE as well as Khun Sa’s
Mong Tai Army had access to the sophisticated Thai and Cambodian arms markets.&nbsp;
While the arms pipeline of the semi-covert multi-national anti-Soviet Afghan
campaign continues to feed South Asia the LTTE has established relations
with Gulbaddin Hekmatiyar’s Hezbi-Islami <B>[<A HREF="#36">36</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
The solidarity between insurgent groups was best expressed when a Sikh
insurgent group in Germany collected money for the family of Dhanu, the
assassin of Rajiv Gandhi. The Sikh’s claimed openly, "We have killed the
mother, and you the son." The LTTE has also established links with at least
21 Tamil Nadu separatist groups. Although, these groups have only an electoral
base of three million out of 60 million Tamils in India, if members of
these groups are sufficiently motivated, politically and militarily trained,
the damage they could do in Tamil Nadu is significant. Some of these groups
are <B>[<A HREF="#37">37</A>]</B>:

<BR>&nbsp;(21) Marxist Periyar Socialist Party

<P>Today, the LTTE is looking beyond India and South Asia. But the links
established by the LTTE in Asia is not fully known. The security and intelligence
cooperation between the Sri Lankan and other agencies in the region has
not been adequately developed. In 1995, western intelligence and security
agencies received information that the LTTE had established links with
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), a powerful Colombian insurgent
group dealing in narcotics. In fact, it was believed that for the first
time the LTTE had purchased vessels that could cross the Atlantic or the
Pacific and reach Latin America. Although the LTTE has exchanged and procured
weapons from a number of insurgent groups including the Khmer Rough and
maintained links with South Africa’s ANCL, Namibia’s SWAPO and Eritira-Ethiopia’s
EPLF and TPLF, very little is known about its Middle Eastern connections,
except for the fact that Tamil insurgents had trained at least in Lebanon
with Fatah, the militant wing of the PLO and in the Syrian controlled Bekka
Valley with PFLP. At these training camps, Tamil groups came into contact
with a number of other groups, including the Japanese Red Army and the
Kurdish PKK operating from Turkey.

<P>The LTTE has also the potential to develop close operational cooperation
with the Brotherhood through its links with the Afghan mujahidin and the
Kashmiri mujahidin, two groups with which LTTE has had substantial technological
links. Interestingly, the Muslim Brotherhood and its South Asian counter
part Jamaati Islami sponsor wars of Islamic revival from Algeria to Egypt,
Sudan to Saudi Arabia, Bosnia to Chechnya, Afghanistan to Kashmir, and
Central Asia to Mindanao in the Philippines.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>International Security Implications&nbsp;</B>

<P>Internationally, the LTTE has not only been active politically and economically.
Their extensive political and economic presence has enabled them to be
militarily active as well. The LTTE understood quite early that in order
to expand their political and economic powerbase, they will have to strengthen
their legal as well as extralegal capability outside Sri Lanka. Although
small in number, the LTTE has assassinated Tamils in Europe, North America
and in South Asia. Today, at least the law enforcement agencies of three
European governments particularly prohibit Sri Lankan Tamils from carrying
weapons on themselves.

<P>Today, the main centers of LTTE activity are in London and Paris for
Europe and New Jersey and Toronto for North America. The key propaganda
centers using computers primarily the information super highway are in
Texas (USA) and Norway. Although the LTTE has an international secretariat
located on Katherine Road in London, the LTTE has decentralized much of
its international activities and operations since 1991. The decentralization
was due to the pressure placed on the LTTE by Britain soon after the Rajiv
Gandhi assassination in May 1991. After the assassination, RAW stepped
up surveillance on LTTE international operations. Aggressive lobbying by
diplomats of the Indian foreign office and operatives of the RAW, India’s
premier external intelligence agency,&nbsp; led to the deportation of Sathasivam
Krishnaswamy alias Kittu, the charismatic one legged one time Jaffna commander
from London to Switzerland. The stepping up of surveillance by European
security and intelligence agencies particularly at the request of the US
on insurgent groups from the Middle East and the Kurdish PKK has made it
difficult for the LTTE to sustain many of its operations in the West. As
a consequence, the LTTE shifted most of its activities out of Britain.
When Indian foreign service and intelligence service personnel began to
mount pressure on the western government, the LTTE began to spread into
Asia.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Network’s Implications&nbsp;</B>

<P>Today, the LTTE has established offices and cells in over 38 countries,
the latest being in Japan, South Africa and Botswana.&nbsp; For the survival
of the LTTE, it is necessary for them to expand globally, because the LTTE
had lost its most important external base of Tamil Nadu after the assassination
of Rajiv Gandhi. Instead of LTTE speed boats shuttling between India and
Sri Lanka for its supplies, today the LTTE ships navigate internationally
bringing supplies to feed its fighting machinery. In many ways, the network
developed by the LTTE over the years in India has been replicated, developed
and sustained globally.

<P>From about 1992, the LTTE has been shifting its international operations
from Western Europe to Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and to South East Asia.
From about 1995, based on information that Western operatives had gathered,
the LTTE operations in the US as well as Canada has come under close scrutiny.
While shifting their activities out of the North Atlantic area, the LTTE
has also made attempts to win over key individuals in Western governments.
As North America and Europe is so vital to the LTTE, they have hired some
of the best lawyers, public relations agencies and lobbied political leaders
into supporting them. In Canada when the LTTE leader Suresh was arrested
for extortion and collecting money to procure weapons, the LTTE hired some
of the finest lawyers and arranged for Western academics who sympathized
with their cause to justify before the Canadian court that the LTTE is
not a terrorist but a liberation movement. When the US was moving the anti-terrorism
legislation that will affect LTTE activities in the US, a reputed public
relations firm in the US was consulted by the LTTE to counter lobby the
bill.&nbsp; LTTE manipulated Tamil communities from Canada to Australia
have campaigned for host country political leaders with the hope that they
will support the Tamil cause once in power.

<P>The shift from West to East, particularly to South East Asia and the
Far East has enabled the LTTE to grow in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition
to the naval base in Twante, the LTTE also trained members of the Tamil
National Retrieval Force, a high profile Indian Tamil secessionist group,
and dispatched them to India. Under pressure from the Sri Lankan government,
the military junta in Myanmar forced the LTTE to vacate Twante by January
1996. The LTTE also developed difficulties of continuing their training
in an island off Malaysia. This training, carried out in absolute secrecy,
called "Singapore training" had helped the LTTE to compliment the RAW training
in Vishakhapattnam. The LTTE had hired former Norwegian naval personnel
to train LTTE cadres in underwater activities in the diving school. Meanwhile,
the LTTE also developed a base in an island off Pukhet in Thailand.&nbsp;
Surveillance in&nbsp; this area by RAW led an Indian submarine to mount
surveillance on an LTTE ship Horizon operating under the name of Julex
Comex 3 transporting weapons to Sri Lanka via Pukhet. Julex Comex 3 was
destroyed near the Sri Lankan coast of Mualtivu in early 1996.

<P><B>Fighting the network&nbsp;</B>

<P>Government of Sri Lanka has neither developed a systematic plan nor
the organization to cripple the backbone of this network. The backbone,
which is political propaganda, is aimed at building support for the creation
of a separate state, the LTTE as an organization and Prabhakaran as its
leader.

<P>Since mid 1986, the government has begun to reflect on the network and
fight the network. Strategically, LTTE procurement operations can be restrained
by generating an excellent counter propaganda network. Tactically, counter
propaganda should be conducted with the support of Sri Lankans living overseas
(individually or through their associations) by the Sri Lankan foreign
missions <B>[<A HREF="#38">38</A>]</B>.&nbsp; For this, Sri Lanka’s classical
foreign policy role of liaison with governments must change. Sri Lanka
must aim for an innovative foreign policy to meet the current challenges
and future threats. At least 40% of the foreign policy budget and 40 %
of the time of Sri Lankan diplomats should be geared to fighting LTTE propaganda
and building support among Sri Lankan and foreign governments against the
LTTE. This has not happened primarily due to two reasons.

<P>First, policy and decision makers of the Government of Sri Lanka has
not fully recognised the LTTE threat stemming from overseas. Many are not
even aware that one out of every five Sri Lankan Tamils, live overseas.
Even, well traveled Sri Lankan diplomats see only a part of that threat.
They see it individually and not collectively - often country wise, at
best by region, very few the bigger global picture. It is because the Ministry
of Defence or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet conducted a comprehensive
study on the LTTE international network and developed a corresponding counter
strategy. Towards this end an interministerial committee for defence and
foreign affairs has been proposed <B>[<A HREF="#39">39</A>]</B>.&nbsp;
The committee, if formed will (a) assess the threat, (b) review government
progress, and (c) task relevant agencies to produce and disseminate counter
propaganda <B>[<A HREF="#40">40</A>]</B>.&nbsp; Creating an interministerial
operations room to monitor and rapidly respond to LTTE international procurement,
funding, and propaganda has also been proposed <B>[<A HREF="#41">41</A>]</B>.

<P>Second, Sri Lankan diplomats have not been trained to conduct counter
propaganda by personnel drawn from the Directorate of Military Intelligence
and the National Intelligence Bureau. Although proposed, the Bandaranaike
International Diplomatic Training Institute, established in early 1996,
has yet to educate Sri Lankan diplomats on the LTTE history, organization,
and operation. Most Sri Lankan diplomats are not aware that EROS has two
factions. The EROS Raji Shankar faction support the government and the
EROS Balkumar faction work with the LTTE. Sri Lankan diplomats cannot be
expected to play a critical role without a thorough grounding in terrorism.
If this is accomplished, Sri Lankan diplomats can play a leading role in
building international support to fight terrorism, not only in South Asia
but, throughout the word.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Government Response&nbsp;</B>

<P>The lack of international and regional interagency and security cooperation
has brought about this predicament. Sri Lankan agencies have been weak
in their efforts to develop frontline intelligence on the LTTE international
as well as the domestic operations. The lack of political commitment to
embark on high risk operations both overseas and domestic is seen as a
major impediment to weakening the LTTE.

<P>At a military level, the government forces continue to fight an unconventional
war, in a conventional mode. The need to transform the national security
doctrine, training and weaponry to meet the growing internal threat has
been long felt. But, to date a bulk of Sri Lankan troops are being trained
to fight across clear battle lines. The pace at which, the counter insurgency
component is being developed, is slow and inadequate to meet the growing
threat.

<P>Further, the government continues to chase the military option. Government
has failed to expand its activities in the non-military counter-insurgency
spectrum. The government has failed to develop the political, socio-economic
and international dimensions of counter insurgency. This has been largely
due to the inability of the national security apparatus to integrate the
military and non-military dimensions of insurgency. The development of
an integrated and a unified strategy is seen as a major requirement.

<P>Bringing the civilian and military branches to work together in the
recently recovered Jaffna peninsula has met with internal difficulties.
Many believe that the postings to the north of public officials are based
on political colour or as a punishment transfer. On the contrary, the most
able and the most dedicated public officials must be posted to the north.
The militarily recovered north will be lost if the support of the Tamil
public cannot be secured politically and economically. The half a million
Tamils in the peninsula influence at least two hundred thousand Tamiils
living overseas.

<P>At a political level, the government has failed to develop and implement
political strategies to provide an alternative path to the Tamil people
from being sucked into the gun culture. The package is attractive to many
Tamils but even they question whether it will see the light of day? What
is required is not grand plans but immediate measures to alleviate the
suffering of the people of the northeast.

<P>The domestic Tamils continuously grade the genuine sincerity of the
government’s attitude towards resolving the current ethnic crisis.&nbsp;
The international Tamil community reacts both according to the response
of their kith and kin in Sri Lanka and to the plea of the LTTE. These are
the very dynamics the government has failed to shift. As long as the staus-quo
remain, the exodus of the Tamils from Sri Lanka should come as no surprise.
If the insurgency continues more people will join the exodus. The alternative
is an unhappy one, often a traumatic one. One generation has already seen
and become influenced by nothing but war, anti-government and pro-LTTE
propaganda, and anti-Sinhala and pro-Tamil nationalist views. A boy or
a girl who was born in 1970, would have heard only of violence against
the Tamils since he was ten years old. By the age of 15, he would have
witnessed violence. By the time he reached 25, he or a member of his immediate
or greater family would have experienced violence.&nbsp; Had the compulsions
not driven him towards insurgency by that time, he would have actively
or passively suffered from the day to day consequences of Eelam War I,
II and III. One generation, has been completely wasted by war. The Sri
Lankan political leaders and the bureaucrats have not done their best to
end war in Sri Lanka.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Domestic Response&nbsp;</B>

<P>There has been no marked response of the non-governmental community
to the internationalization of the Sri Lankan Tamil conflict. It has been,
more or less, an extension of their attitude to the domestic developments.
Some question whether they have been numbed by war. Others characterize
this as a very Sri Lankan attitude.

<P>The non-governmental community - commercial, social and religious leaders,
and academics, scholars and media personnel - has not realized that they
have a major role to play when the security of their country is at stake.
Economic diplomacy as a tool in conflict resolution is gathering momentum
throughout the world. Economics can build broken bridges. Economics cut
across ethnicity and religiosity. For ethnic and religious based conflicts,
military solutions are increasingly seen as temporary solutions. Economics
offer permanent solutions. Entrepreneurs and other business leaders can
pressurize governments, communities and even groups committed to violence
to end war. Most leaders of this category in Sri Lanka have decided to
play a marginal or non role either in the prosecution of the war or in
the peace and reconciliation process.

<P>In the Sri Lankan context, social and religious leaders have either
not asserted their rights or they have chosen sides. They must be above
ethnic polarization. What has adversely affected ethnic and religious communities
are the very campaigns to advance their interests. A closer look at the
plight of both the Tamil and the Sinhala communities demonstrate this fact.
The era of working for "my community" is gone. From Bosnia to Jaffna, religious
and ethnic nationalisms have devastated people and their interests beyond
comprehension. Social and religious leaders, must generate the will to
rise above ethnicity and religiosity, in their endeavor to serve their
people and their countries.&nbsp; There has been no effort by any of these
leaders to address the Tamil Diaspora and lobby them into generating a
negotiated settlement.

<P>A majority of Sri Lankan scholars and academics live in their ivory
towers. They have not ventured out to capture the tragedy and trauma of
the intermittent insurrections and analyze their causes. A vast majority
of them have not made any in put to government policy. There is a dire
need to fully assess the impact of the activities of the Sri Lankan Diaspora
on the national security of Sri Lanka. This has escaped the minds of even
the best of Sri Lankan scholars and academics. It is research that should
be best conducted by independent academics and scholars because they would
have greater insight into the Diaspora. Research in a nation like Sri Lanka,
torn apart by conflict, must focus on dampening violence. The scholars
and academics have a major obligation to contribute to the national harmony
of their country if not the region and the world.

<P>Sinhalese and Tamil dons in particular, have not focused on the international
implication of a domestic insurgency or the impact of the Diaspora on the
domestic situation. Instead, many of them have continued to pursue their
traditional disciplines of research and writing. Sri Lankan scholars and
academics, instead of working on subjects that have no or little application
to the national development of Sri Lanka, must conduct frontline research
both on the ethnic conflict and its vicious byproduct - the insurgency.
They must learn from other countries.&nbsp; Scholars and academics in the
developed countries would work closely with the government. They will be
formally and informally advising the government on the modifications required
in their national policies to govern better and more effectively. Working
in isolation with data generated from newspaper accounts and published
reports cannot produce first rate research. Field research is critical
for penetrating analyses. While, departing from this monotonous tradition
of working strictly in their disciplines and confined to their homes, libraries,
departments and conferences, Sri Lankan scholars and academics must begin
to explore ways and means of becoming more useful to the country. Some
of the best minds in the government in the developed world are academics
and scholars. They are not classical bureaucrats unable to meet the emerging
challenges. They are innovative in their approach, multidisciplinary in
their thinking and cross culturally amenable.

<P>The mass media in Sri Lanka has improved dramatically in the recent
years. They have been able to write accurate accounts of developments in
the northeast and overseas on the ethnic issue. However, they have to move
beyond reporting to analysis and advocacy. Although, media is not expected
to take a rigid position and only report events as they occur, the media
in a developing country has a more responsible role to play. The Sri Lankan
media barons must reflect on this need .

<P>Sri Lankan news media has failed to educate the Sri Lankan public on
terrorism. The average Sri Lankan is not alert to the destruction of terrorism.
A civilian will often not be sensitized to alerting a law enforcement official
to an unclaimed parcel in a public place. Similarly, the media has failed
to educate them on the range of tools available in conflict management.
The military option is only one road to combating rebellion. There are
so many rebellions that have been resolved by negotiations. They have to
be brought to light as well. The media, at the turn of the twentieth century,
has role to guide leaders and lobby the public.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>Peace Process&nbsp;</B>

<P>Organizations committed to peace have mushroomed in Colombo in the recent
decade. Unfortunately, the focus of the peace industry has been "peace
out of context." The leaders and members of these organizations have virtually
no knowledge of the developments in the northeast. Therefore, they are
vulnerable to manipulation by agents of insurgents or by insurgent propaganda.
Many of these organizations have been infiltrated by other interest groups
too. To retain their credibility, these groups must be politically neutral.
To project their sincerity and commitment, they must work at the source
of violence.

<P>Those leaders and members who are truly committed to peace must realize
that being a peace activist is as risky as being a law enforcement officer.
In context, the peace activists, have to venture out of Colombo and work
in the war-zone, in the border villages, and in areas vulnerable to disruption.
Staging demonstrations, rallies, marches and conferences, in the capital
of Colombo, will not help. It will only make the government harden their
stand towards war and advocate war as a strategy towards peace. Genuinely
committed peace activists have to travel and live in the war zone, meet
insurgent leaders and stress the importance of peace to them. They have
to meet the parents, whose children have been committed to violence, to
dissuade them from doing so. Similarly, they should campaign to move the
government into bringing about policies of equality. The bravest of the
peace activists must play a role on the ground. They could facilitate prisoner
exchange. They could dissuade combatants on both sides from refraining
from fighting in build up areas that produce civilian casualties.

<P>The macro view of peace is broader. Peace groups should be able to bring
the government and the LTTE to the negotiating table. They should be able
to pressurize governments that permit the LTTE to function in their countries,
to exercise pressure on the LTTE to negotiate. Peace groups must reinforce
the dialogue and the commitment of both parties to peace by participation.
<BR>&nbsp;

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><B>International Community’s Response&nbsp;</B>

<P>The International community’s response to transnational insurgency has
been weak. The LTTE along with several other insurgent groups have established
offices and cells throughout the world.&nbsp; Most of these offices engage
in disseminating propaganda and collecting money.&nbsp; In most countries
the LTTE&nbsp; would collect money for the purchase of armaments under
the guise of supporting rehabilitation. The LTTE has organized over 30
rallies and demonstrations in 1994 and 1995 in the West, including in front
of the White House in Washington DC and the UN in New York. Ironically,
the placards hoisted included photographs of Prabhakaran, who has taken
the lives of two heads of government.

<P>The US has played a leading role in the Middle East and since recently
in Latin America to dampen terrorist activity. However, the US has played
a key role only when it directly affected US security interests. Due to
US interests in Turkey, Washington lobbied its European allies to close
down Kurdish PKK offices in Europe, particularly after PKK firebombed Turkish
diplomatic and tourist offices. Similarly, the US extended assistance to
the government in Peru after Sendero Luminoso began to deal in narcotics
in a big way. The US, despite the poor human rights record of the Myanmar
military junta, started supporting the military regime to fight the drug
lords engaged in producing narcotics that is threatening US interests.
US assistance to fight the LTTE has been small - the Sri Lankan government
too has not lobbied the US government substantially to secure a high degree
of US military, security and intelligence cooperation.

<P>However, the US has realized the emerging dangers of transnational terrorism.
The Western world as a whole has suffered as a consequence of conflicts
in the Middle East.&nbsp; With the recent developments in the Middle East,
governments of the developing world are attaching a high priority to security.
In the years ahead, anti-terrorism legislation in countries of the developed
world will make it difficult for groups like the LTTE to operate under
the cover of political offices. However, the nature of terrorism is such
that insurgent groups like the LTTE will develop new methods of operation
to evade arrest.

<P>The political dimension of insurgent groups have been equally hard to
fight. How does a domestic government stop an insurgent group from transferring
funds from a bank in Singapore to Dresden to buy explosives or from Westpack
in Australia to a Swiss account to pay for an arms consignment? Modern
insurgent groups are beginning to operate like multinational firms or like
intelligence agencies with a global reach. Recent evidence confirm that
the LTTE has manipulated a number of human rights groups in the West to
supporting them. The LTTE has poured in money and requested its supporters
to campaign for certain candidates in countries like Australia, England,
India and Canada so that in the event they come into power, the LTTE could
use them to advance LTTE goals.&nbsp; NGOs have been manipulated by the
LTTE and their front organizations to pressurize the government. The LTTE
has lobbied for the appointment of certain individuals who are pro LTTE
to head the Sri Lanka NGO consortium. Further, the LTTE has developed relationships
with officials who determine the yearly aid package from Sri Lanka. The
Paris Aid Group meeting has become a forum to lobby for and against aid
in Sri Lanka both by the LTTE and government lobbyists.&nbsp; LTTE has
also secured the support of a number of intellectuals in the West like
Peter Schalk of Uppsala University and human rights lawyers like Karen
Parker to support them. Many of them have expressed their support to the
LTTE at several meetings. The LTTE has also gained excellent access to
media organizations from the newspapers in Canada to the BBC in London.
The LTTE has also gained access to some world leaders through powerful
business friends and other connections.

<P>In the legislative and legal fronts, the international community is
preparing to develop frameworks to regulate and dampen activities of groups
like the LTTE. Individual governments are realizing and they ought to take
action, either to step up surveillance or ban organizations with a transnational
reach like the LTTE.
<BR>Despite the fact that the LTTE is not a banned organization in Sri
Lanka, the LTTE has been proscribed by two governments - India renewed
its two yearly ban in May of 1996, and Malaysia indefinitely. In Switzerland
and in at least another two European countries, LTTE activity has led governments
to ban Sri Lankans from carrying weapons on them. Australia came close
to banning the LTTE in 1995, but the unwillingness of Colombo to ban the
LTTE in Sri Lanka, precluded the Canberra government from moving in that
direction. This is a security paradox - the government in Colombo has to
leave its doors open for the LTTE to enter the mainstream while fighting
them. Several countries have revised their anti-terrorist legislation and
others are in the process of reviewing their legislative loop holes. The
line between political action and military activity is very thin - this
is a phenomenon that most political leaders both in the East and West have
failed to understand.

<P>Many of the modern conflicts are ethnic or religion-oriented. Often
they cannot be resolved militarily. Third party mediation is required because
such culturally based conflicts are deep rooted and protracted. Is peace
making a line in the non political spectrum of counter insurgency?&nbsp;
Peace is the absence of war but interludes of peace as a strategy has been
used both by the insurgents to regroup, rearm and retrain themselves and
take on the state exploiting the element of surprise.

<P>Governments in the Asia-Pacific region believe that the LTTE is emerging
as a major destabilizing force. As a group, the LTTE is at the cutting
edge of technology.&nbsp; In Sri Lanka, the first rocket propelled grenade
launcher was recovered from a LTTE camp. Similarly, night vision glasses
were used for the first time in the Sri Lankan battlefield by the LTTE.&nbsp;
The LTTE, at the forefront of insurgent technological innovation, has gained
mastery in the use of dual technology.&nbsp; Before the Sri Lankan military,
the LTTE purchased Global Positioning Satellite systems, to accurately
target its projectiles. The LTTE also used a land based satellite system
to communicate with its overseas cadres. The LTTE has used the world wide
web and the internet to establish a sophisticated state-of-the-art propaganda
as well as a communication system within its members and supporters.&nbsp;
LTTE suicide bombers have been trained both in France and in Britain to
fly light aircraft. These ultralights do not carry sufficient metal for
radar detection. Further, they could take off from a short runway. It is
likely that these aircraft laden with explosives will be used to take vital
economic, political and military targets, reminiscent of the Kamikazis
<B>[<A HREF="#42">42</A>]</B>.

<P>In many ways, the technology generated by the LTTE has been a model
for many other groups. There has been technology transfer or technology
emulation. Today, suicide bomb technology is used by the Hamas, Algerian
FIS, Kurdish PKK and the Punjabi Sikh insurgents. The LTTE body suit is
more advanced than the body suits used by any of the other groups. The
Western agencies watch a possible transfer of suicide technology from the
LTTE particularly to the Middle Eastern groups, where the suicide bomb
technology is still very rudimentary compared to their South Asian counterparts.
Can the LTTE conduct a suicide strike for another militant group for ideological
or financial reasons?

<P>Although the LTTE has not conducted significant military strikes outside
Sri Lanka and India, it has the potential to do so. The LTTE has a worldwide
reach and a worldwide presence. The LTTE has assassinated a handful of
opponents in Switzerland, France, Germany, Britain and in Canada.&nbsp;
Although it has not yet conducted transnational terrorist strikes to the
scale of the Palestinian, Armenian, Kurdish and other Middle Eastern groups,
it has the potential to do so. The LTTE arms purchasing operations to finance
generation projects can become the model for some groups. To combat groups
like the LTTE new security structures will have to be developed. The idea
of developing transnational forces to combat transnational terrorism is
fast becoming one of the post-Cold war security imperatives. Considering
the recent organizational and operational developments, is the LTTE a destabilizing
force in the South Asian region? Is the LTTE a destabilizing force in the
rest of Asia Pacific? Is the&nbsp; LTTE a destabilizing force internationally
?

<P>Although the international community will never allow a major interstate
war, the international community should realize that intrastate wars have
significant spill-over effects that can complicate regional and international
security to a very high degree. The 21st century insurgent groups will
be very different from the twentieth century insurgents. Until recently,
technology doubled every 25 years. Today, technology doubles every year.&nbsp;
If not regulated and controlled, insurgents empowered by subnational groups
will begin to use technology the same way governments use them. After the
end of the Cold War, the porosity of the boundaries has transformed the
international system dramatically.&nbsp; Countries cannot live in isolation
any more. What will ensure the security of a nation-state is not only internal
stability but the stability of one’s neighbor and the region. Therefore,
security of the 21st century will have to be cooperative and collective
and not isolationist and individual.

The LTTE paid for the SAMs - US $ 1 million a piece - from narcotics profits.
Although the governments of the Philippines. India, Germany, Italy and
Canada, have records of LTTE narcotics couriers, the Sri Lankan government
is yet to unearth substantial information. This is confirmed by reviewing
a report by Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of narcotics Punchi
Banda Seneviratna submitted to Ambassador Phillip Wilcox, coordinator,
Counter terrorism, US State Department, through the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Colombo in 1996. Large consignments of brown sugar has been transported
by the LTTE between India and Sri Lanka. The LTTE has exercised tremendous
caution in narcotics trafficking. Such operations are clandestine even
as far as the senior LTTE leaders are concerned. Sri Lankan agencies have
failed to pool all available information on the LTTE narcotics connection
and provide them to friendly agencies - from interpol to intelligence -
for follow up action.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="23"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Corrupt military generals of the Royal Cambodian
Armed Forces sold Russian made SAM 7s procured in the 1980s to both the
LTTE and to the famous Opium warlord Khun Sa. Bangkok based Robert Karniol,
Asia-Pacific Regional Editor for Janes, and secret sources confirmed the
purchase. According to Thai intelligence, Surface-to-Air-Missiles were
moved from Koh Kong, extreme south west of Cambodia to Chumporn in Thailand
and then across Kra Isthmus to Phuket. This was one of the three shipments
by the LTTE during the LTTE-PA talks.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="24"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Almost all the major insurgent groups engage
in narcotics trafficking. Columbia’s FARC, Peru’s&nbsp; Shinning Path,
Myanmar’s Khun Sa militia, Turkey’s PKK’s and Afghanistan’s Hizbi-Islami
lead the list. The LTTE narcotics trafficking is carried out in high secrecy.
The LTTE intelligence wing and those engaged in narcotics trafficking often
use private boats as they want to be clandestine even as far as the other
LTTE cadres are concerned.&nbsp; Narcotics trafficking generates an income
between US $ 100-150 to 400 million according to a specialist on narcotics
and security Dr. H.P. Klepak and the prestigious Groupe d ‘action financire
internationale. See, H.P. Klepak (1985) The International Drug Trade -

<A NAME="28"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Kumaran Padmanthan alias Selvarajah’s real
name is Tharmalingam Shanmugam Kumaran. He was born in Uddipiddy on April
6, 1955. He is one of the few untrained cadres. His national identity card
number is 550971231V and Sri Lankan passport number is J0803500. Address:
No 130 KKS Road, Jaffna, Sri Lanka and No 5 Periyer Nagar, Salem -1, Tamil

and had the title to the deed Eye Pearls Farm and company at Perumgal near
Vellore executed in his favor in 1987. This farm was a top secret LTTE
hide out for arms and ammunition storage, as well as being a center for
communication with the leadership in Jaffna. He developed his relations
with the international shipping trade through the Bombay shipping magnate
Pratima Das. Kumaran has established several companies for money laundering
and front organizations. They range from a export import firm in Malaysia
where he is director, Rani restaurant in Cambodia, Carlton company in Bangladesh
and Eagle trading company in Myanmar. The latter two companies played a
vital role in the Ukrainian arms shipment to the LTTE.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="31"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Soranalingam Vaithiyalingam alias Sorani
alias Shankar, born in Jaffna on September 19, 1949, lived for many years
in Vavuniya, Colombo (where he studied) and in Canada. He speaks fluent
Sinhala, English and Tamil. His Sri Lanka passport no is U757874. He also
has an Indian passport. Address: 2nd mile post, Mannar Road, Vavuniya.
In Vavuniya, his parental family owned a club. He has lost at least two
brothers while serving in the LTTE. He joined the LTTE after the riots
of&nbsp; 1983 and served as head of internal security. His address while
in India from late 1983 to late 1986 was no 12 Seshachalam Mudahi Street,
Saidapet, Madras 15. During the IPKF episode he served as an advisor in
the military operations section of the LTTE and was based in Nithideva
prison camp (Justice God) in the one four base complex. He is highly trusted
by Prabhakaran. He played a critical role in the prosecution of Mahattaya,
the deputy leader of the LTTE.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="32"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>The LTTE would use these ships for clandestine
activity only less than 5% of their shipping time. Most of these ships
are manned by Sri Lankan Tamil civilians as well as LTTE cadres. There
are foreigners working on board these ships too.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="33"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Sir Richard Clutterbuck drew an interesting
parallel. Comparing the monster of terrorism to a dragon he said that the
head was in Delhi, the heart in Madras and the tail in Sri Lanka. He added,
"However much we cut the tail, it will grow." This was the rationale for
the then President J.R. Jayewardene signing an agreement with India to
resolve the Tamil conflict in Sri Lanka.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="34"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>The figure of 14,000 was an estimate by
the Sri Lankan Directorate of Military Intelligence and the National Intelligence
Bureau in mid 1995. Western security and intelligence agencies place the
figure at about 18,000 cadres. The LTTE has seven wings. (1) Military (2)
Political (3) Intelligence (4) Sea Tigers (5) Women (6) Finance and (7)
Procurement. Except, the KP department, or the international procurement
department named after Kumaran Padmanathan, all the other cadres are military
trained.&nbsp; According to a recent estimate, the strength of the six
special regiments -&nbsp; Imran-Pandyan, Charles Anthony, Kittu, Commando,
Malathi, Sothiya&nbsp; - and the six district regiments&nbsp; - Jaffna,
Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Weli Oya-Mulativu, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi -&nbsp;
itself closes upon 15,000 cadres. With the loss of Jaffna and Kilinochchi,
the LTTE shifted its cadres to the Mulativu, Mannar and Eastern areas.</FONT></LI>

The Inside Story of the JVP (Colombo: Institute of Fundamental Studies,
1995). p 369.&nbsp; The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP: Peoples Liberation
Front) is a Marxist Leninist group with origins in the late 1960s, that
has increasingly assumed a Sinhala nationalist character. It staged two
insurrections in 1971 and in the 1987-1990 years.&nbsp; The concluding
chapter argues that the JVP will reemerge despite the extrajudicial execution
of 12 of its 13 politburo members and tens of thousands of cadres and supporters
because the root causes remain alive. Events since then demonstrate that
the JVP has once again become a formidable political force. The last and
the only surviving member of the politburo Somawansa Amarasinghe directs
the JVP from his secret headquarters in Paris.</FONT></LI>

<A NAME="38"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Most hitherto generated propaganda would
only polarize the two communities. By calling the LTTE "terrorists" and
Tamil expatriates their "supporters," Sinhalese would become more nationalistic
and Tamils more determined to fight for a separate Tamil State. Propaganda
has not been conducted in Tamil. Recent study by the Institute of Strategic
Studies, Ministry of Defense suggests that propaganda should (a) sympathize
with the plight of the Tamil community (b) highlight the criminal wastage
of Tamil lives and resources at the hands of Prabhakaran (c) list all the
Tamil leaders have been exterminated by the LTTE (c) predict that there
will be no democracy under the LTTE&nbsp; (d) assess that India will never
allow Tamil Eelam to be established and (e) call for an alternate Tamil
leadership.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="39"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>In Sri Lanka, defence and external affairs
were together till the late 1970s, because foreign policy and defence were
closely linked. After the end of the Cold war, trade and foreign affairs
has been linked together by Australia. The LTTE international network is
a threat to the national security of Sri Lanka. However, it can only be
countered with the total co-operation and conjunction of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="40"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Integral to this is the development of national
psy ops and military psy ops. While there is neither national psy ops,
to build political support for the anti-LTTE campaign, nor military psy
ops, aimed (a) at own troops, (b) enemy troops and (c) the civilians. The
psy ops conducted by military intelligence is extremely weak. Interview
with Lt General Rohan Daluwatte, Army Chief, and other psy ops personnel
in Colombo and Jaffna, August, 1996.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="41"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Even most of the articles in the international
press planted by the LTTE or their supporters go uncountered. An ideal
operation was mounted soon after the riots of July 1983 to respond to the
bad international press. The operations room hooked to Sri Lankan missions
and associations overseas received within 24 hours any critical article
that appeared and the staff responded instantly.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<A NAME="42"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>Some of the cadres trained were Black Tigers.
A key member of this program is Pampan Ajith, a former body guard of Prabhakaran,
currently with the LTTE office in London. Until Jaffna was under LTTE control,
the Sky Tiger base was in Kopay. Before that, the LTTE had another base
in Eludumottuwan. Dr&nbsp; Maheswaran of the UK was the principle advisor
to the LTTE on the Sky Tiger program. Based on an intelligence alert, during
a visit to Jaffna to meet the LTTE leadership and to find a bride, he was
arrested and remanded by the CID in Colombo. To the surprise of many he
was released by the Sri Lankan courts because there was no provision in
the current law to charge him. In the eyes of the law-givers, he had not
committed a "criminal act." The LTTE is not a proscribed organization in
Sri Lanka.</FONT></LI>
