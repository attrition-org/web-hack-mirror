<P>In the past few weeks several articles have been published by prominent
figures in Hamas hinting at a possible change--or at least rethinking and
reevaluation--of its terrorist tactics.

<P>Yet another of these articles was published in the October 1998 issue
of the monthly <I>Filastin al-Muslimah</I>, the principal organ of Hamas,
published in London. The article, this time under the very clear title:
“A new method of military resistance in Palestine,” is unsigned. An anonymous
article in this monthly usually means either that it reflects the views
of the Hamas leadership rather than those of an individual member, or that
it was sent from inside the Territories and its author does not want to
be exposed to pressures from the Palestinian Authority. It should be noted
that the present article was written before the killing of the Awadallah
brothers and the threats of Hamas to carry out large-scale operations in
revenge.

<TD><B>Special for <I>Filastin al-Muslimah</I>, “After the two operations
in Hebron and Tel-Aviv: A new method of military resistance in Palestine,”
<I>Filastin al-Muslimah</I>, October 1998, p. 19.</B>

<P>The Zionist settlers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have recently
increased their terrorist attacks against the Palestinian inhabitants.
At the same time the Palestinian resistance has escalated its method of
operations aiming at attacking the leaders of these settlers and their
locations inside Israel. The observers and analyzers this time have noted
the fact that no faction has taken responsibility for the attacks. Some
sources have indicated that this series of operations, which was well prepared,
was similar to the methods of the Qassam Brigades of Hamas. There would
seem to be a new mode of operation taken by the faction that carried out
those attacks. We may say that this new method is a consequence of various
circumstances. The most important of these is the wish to leave the Zionist
investigators of the Israeli General Security Service (Shabak) and the
police, in the fog. Another reason is the wish to protect the members of
the faction and their sympathizers from the arbitrary justice of the Palestinian
police, which persists in abusing, arresting and killing the fighters,
in accordance with its missions as assigned in the Oslo Accord and in its
agreements with the Zionist entity and the United States.&nbsp;

<P><B>A qualified operation in Hebron</B>

<P>It all began in Hebron, the city of the continuing Jihad, as was best
described by the Israeli security commentator Roni Shaqed who wrote: “In
Hebron, the closure and the curfew are periods between one operation and
another. No one has illusions. Everyone knows that the coming wave of terrorist
operations is only a matter of time, in spite of the Israeli military and
security measures taken by the Occupation in the city.” There are about
1300 Zionist soldiers on the line between the Palestinian neighborhoods
and the nests of the terrorist settlers in the city. This is the most overcrowded
location with enemy troops; three soldiers for every settler. Nevertheless,
as confirmed also by enemy security sources, anyone who wishes to carry
out an operation will find the door for it.&nbsp;

<P>A qualified development of the Palestinian military activity was the
success of one of the Mujahideen. On 30<SUP>th</SUP> August, 1998 he penetrated
the Zionist military barriers in the old part of the city, and broke into
the house of Rabbi Shlomo Ra`nan, 63 years old, grandson of the spiritual
leader of the Zionist settling movement. He managed to fatally stab him
several times and to set fire in the house to eliminate any survivors,
before returning home safely.&nbsp;

<P><B>A closure, curfew and the arbitrary justice of the settlers</B>

<P>Following this heroic operation in Hebron the army and the police made
a large-scale search, pronouncing the city a closed military area. The
Palestinian police in turn searched the areas under its control. Netanyahu
cut off his vacation in the northern part of Palestine to consult his ministers.
He declared that Israel would do its best to protect the Jews of Hebron,
and that they were close to his heart and their protection will be strengthened.
Only a couple of days after this announcement the enemy army decided to
rearm 250 settlers of the Jewish right-wing organizations with the weapons
that had been taken from them on the advise of the inquiry committee set
by the previous government after the massacre in the Abraham sanctuary.&nbsp;

<P>The settlers have deliberately organized special patrols in the streets
of the old part of the city, attacked Palestinian inhabitants and stopped
some of them to check their identity cards.&nbsp;

<P>As to the closure on the city, it brought about a sever crisis of drinking
water. The technical Palestinian teams who handled the issue could not
move between the water pipe lines in and out of the city. The various medical
centers in Hebron could not work as usual, and this increased the suffering
of the inhabitants.

<P><B>The resistance reacts against the settlers in Tel-Aviv</B>

<P>The Palestinian resistance has rapidly moved its area of activity deep
into Israel, specifically to Tel-Aviv. On Thursday, 30<SUP>th</SUP> August,
1998, at 09:45am, a bomb of one kg of explosives plus nails was exploded
in front of a coffee shop in the junction of Rottchild St. And Allenby
St. Twenty-one Israelis were wounded, one with moderate to severe wounds.
No one took responsibility for the explosion and the security service did
not uncover the cell or the group behind it. This operation, in spite of
its limited casualties, made the Occupation authorities put its forces
in a situation of extreme alert. It also caused embarrassment to the security
service because there were new, and never before used technologies used
in the explosion. There was no car bomb or suicide operation. This was
another qualified development registered by the resistance and the Jihad
in Palestine.&nbsp;

<P>This article attempts to leave vague the identity of the group responsible
for the above-mentioned operations, while at the same time, making it quite
clear--through various transparent hints--that Hamas was responsible, or
at least that the operations were carried out by Hamas members. However,
it may hint at another new phase in Hamas: a “green light” to the various
Hamas groups in the West Bank, mainly in the Hebron area, to initiate independent
operations. One reason for this change may be due to the difficult situation
of Hamas activists there and the possible increase of surveillance by Palestinian
security forces. We should remember that a number of developments have
put Hamas in a very difficult situation: the killing of Muhi al-Din al-Sharif
in March 1998; the subsequent arrests of Hamas political and military leaders;
the killing of the Awadallah brothers in September 1998; the discovery
of some of its “laboratories” and the pressure on the Palestinian Authority
to increase its cooperation with Israel.

<P>In these circumstances (and perhaps influenced by possible internal
reevaluations), the movement is currently promoting operations that will
on one hand continue to grant Hamas its <I>raison d`etre</I>,<I> </I>especially
with the renewal of the political talks between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority. On the other hand such operation gain the sympathy of large
circles in the Palestinian society--a very important element in the considerations
of the Islamic movement.

<P>The attempt to present two new kinds of operations here may also show
that Hamas is dedicating much thought to the effects of its activities--on
both the Israeli and Palestinian societies. There are hidden elements in
the article that may give the impression that every operation is planned
to attract the sympathy of parts of society without creating alienation
from others. The anonymous author is deliberately indicating at the end
of the article that there was no car bomb or suicide operation, as if to
say that the new methods are more sophisticated: one was an heroic operation
against one person in Hebron and the other in Tel-Aviv caused fewer casualties
than did past operations.

<P>What does all this portend? It is premature to indicate categorically that
this is going to be from now on the nature of the operations of Hamas,
at least in the immediate future, till another next reevaluation. We should
remember also Hamas’ need for a large scale revenge bombing in the style
of the “old” operations, particularly after the ambiguous circumstances
of the killing of the Awadallah brothers. However the present article may
suggest a trend: courageous operations against Jewish settlers in places
in dispute with Israel that may increase the popularity of Hamas, such
as in the old part of Hebron. The article did not mention another operation,
carried out on October 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 1998, by a hand grenade thrown at
a group of Israeli soldiers in the same area, which resulted in the wounding
of 10 soldiers and 4 Palestinian inhabitants. The article was probably
written before this operation, but this operation may be along the lines
of the new method it presents.

<P>The article gives the impression that the main concern of Hamas nowadays
is to conceal its movements and leave them vague, due to the pressure they
are confronting from both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Therefore,
they are willing to commit acts of terror without taking responsibility, based
on the (correct) assumption that the Palestinian public will recognized
the hand of Hamas. The reevaluation is not only a result of looking for
new ways of struggle but--and especially--a consequence of confusion among
its ranks.

<P>The ongoing pressure of the Palestinian security services on Hamas is
therefore a key point and a very crucial factor in countering the terror
of Hamas. This is a barrier that the Islamic movement is facing difficulties
in getting past.
