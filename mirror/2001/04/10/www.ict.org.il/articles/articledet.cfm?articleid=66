<p><p>The following article appeared in the latest edition of the London based
monthly “<i>Filastin al- Muslimah,</i>” Hamas’ main publication, (December
1998). It is a report by Ibrahim Ghosheh, Hamas’ spokesman in Jordan on
his participation in the 18<sup>th</sup> convention of the Islamic Group
(<i>Al-Jama`ah al-Islamiyyah</i>) of Pakistan. The convention was held
in Islamabad on 23-25 October 1998, and was attended by delegates from
more than 30 Islamic groups and movements. Ibrahim Ghosheh attended as
the representative of Hamas. He states that this was his first visit in
Pakistan, although he had past connections with leaders of the Pakistani
Islamic Group. Ghosheh and the leader of that group, Qadi Hussein, were
both members of the Islamic mediation delegation between Iraq and Kuwait
in September 1990, following the Iraqi invasion to Kuwait.

<p>The activities of the convention commenced on Friday, 23 October with
Friday prayers in Faysal Mosque—a place that that may accommodate about
ten thousand people. The first speech was in Urdu by Dr. Anees Ahmad, the
brother of Prof. Khurshid Ahmad. The second was in Arabic by Dr. Ahmad
al-Assal. After the afternoon prayer the leader of the movement gave a
speech in Urdu, which focused on internal affairs. After his speech there
was a collection of donations from the women. The session was held in the
yard of the mosque in which were gathered about half a million men and
women. The Amir of the movement Qadi Hussein signed more than twenty marriage
concessions.&nbsp;
<p>On the evening of the next day, the convention continued with speeches
by the leaders of more than thirty Islamic movements in attendance. All
of them spoke about their countries, their movements and the need to unify
the message of the Muslims. The speeches were translated into Urdu. Ghosheh
made a short speech accompanied by a recording of the blessing of Sheikh
Ahmad Yassin. In the end of his speech Ghosheh gave the Amir of the host
movement a shield of al-Aqsa, a symbol of the unity of the Palestinian
and Kashmiri Jihad.&nbsp;
<p>On 24 October 1998 the Convention for the Aid to the Kashmiri Jihad
was held in one of the biggest hotels in Islamabad, which included several
speeches by Islamic leaders. The principal speech was given by Dr. Abd
al-Rashid al-Turabi, the leader of the Islamic Group of Kashmir. He explained
the dimensions of the Kashmiri problem which affects about 15 million Muslims—one
third of them in independent Kashmir and two thirds in the part of Kashmir
occupied by India since 1948. The Jihad there began to operate consistently
in the past ten years, about the same period of the Palestinian uprising.
They seek the liberation of Kashmir from Indian occupation and the foundation
of an independent Islamic state that will join the Mother State of Pakistan.
A video film concerning the sacrifice of the Islamic warriors in Kashmir
and the abhorrent behavior of the Indian occupation was shown. The convention
ended with a statement of support of the people of Kashmir for the heroic
Jihad.&nbsp;
<p>On 25-26 October 1998, a meeting of the Islamic movements was held.
The meeting was opened by the Amir of the Islamic Group who spoke about
the necessity of the unification of the Islamic movements. He gave some
former examples, such as the delegation of Islamic movements that had attempted
to mediate between Iraq on the one hand and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on
the other, in September 1990. He mentioned the intensive efforts to establish
a secretary of the larger Islamic movements of the Muslim Brotherhood,
The Islamic Group and the Turkish Rafah Party, which has failed. He then
spoke about the position of the Islamic Group towards the intentions of
the Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif to implement the Islamic Shari`ah.
He mentioned the role of his movement to motivate the Pakistani public
to demand the detonation of the Pakistani nuclear bomb in response to the
Indian bomb in May 1998. He mentioned that nuclear research had started
in 1975 in the period of Dhu al- Fiqar Ali Bhutu, and was in readiness
in 1985 in the days of Daya’ ul-Haq. He made it clear that Pakistan should
not sign the convention on the limitation of nuclear experiments (CTBT)
before India and Israel do so.&nbsp;
<p>Afterwards Prof. Khurshid Ahmad spoke about the world economic situation
and the role of the Islamic states in promoting the relationship between
them. He called for the foundation of an Islamic center with a database
on all the Islamic movements and peoples, which will publish scientific
research all over the world on the problems of the Muslims. His suggestion
was approved by all the delegations.
<p>Ibrahim Ghosheh spoke briefly on the Palestinian problem and the dangers
that surround Palestine and the Palestinian people, especially the conspiracy
to destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and build the third Temple. He mentioned
the need for immediate activity on the part of the Islamic movements in
favor of the Jihad in Palestine due to the persecution of the Jihadi movements,
primarily Hamas. He presented the threat of the Wye Plantation Accord to
the essence of the Palestinian people, its unity and infrastructure, from
the kindergartens all the way up to the mosques. He called for the unification
of the support for all the problems of the Muslims.&nbsp;
<p>The representative of the Islamic Jihad in Bangladesh shed light on
the political situation there. He mentioned the death of about 100,000
martyrs since the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 in the
period of Mujib al-Rahman and his successors until the persecution of the
Muslim youngsters was stopped. He was followed by the representatives of
the Islamic groups in Sri Lanka, where the number of Muslims is 15% of
a total population of 100 million. He spoke about their persecution by
both the Tamils and their rivals. Afterwards there was a discussion about
Kashmir and the situation of the Muslims in Great Britain and Canada. A
delegation of the Muslim students spoke about the situation of the Muslims
in India, who number about 220 million. They denied the claims that there
is no support for the Muslims in Kashmir in order not to harm the Muslims
in India. They made it clear that the victory of the Muslims in Kashmir
will strengthen the Muslims in India. They mentioned the strategic alliance
between the Indians and the Jews. They said that both the Indians and the
Jews were seeking ways to expel the Muslims of India and Palestine, in
the same way as the Muslims of Spain were expelled, and that they sought
to employ the example of the destruction of the Babri mosque in India to
the destruction of the el-Aqsa Mosque.&nbsp;
<p>The delegation of the Turkish Fadilah party talked about the secular
campaign there, which is led by the army with the participation of the
Free Masons, the Jews, the media and the Mafia. They described the failure
of the outlawing of the Rafah party and mentioned that the poles predict
that the Fadilah party will gain 32% of the votes in the next elections,
compared to 22% in the last elections in Turkey.&nbsp;
<p>There were also lectures on Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Yemen. One of the
brothers spoke in the name of the Algerian Salvation Front. He praised
the document signed by several Muslim clerics that called for a stop to
the war and a cease-fire declaration of such as was announced by the Islamic
Army. He explained the real situation in Algeria and the role of French-sponsored
police officers in the massacres there, and how official circles had come
up with the idea to terrorize the Islamic elements.
<p>One of the representatives spoke about the situation in Kosovo. He described
how the Army for the liberation of Kosovo was fighting against the Serbian
forces before they enter the villages in order to gain time to evacuate
the villages, thus minimizing the number of victims. He explained the geographical
and strategic importance of Kosovo in the connection between the Islamic
centers Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia. Representatives from Indonesia
and Malaysia spoke about their various problems.
<p>The convention agreed to determine certain days to support the major
problems of the Muslims:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Palestine – 21 August, the memory of the fire in Al-Aqsa Mosque.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Kosovo – 1 Ramadan of each year.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Kashmir – 5 February of each year.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The Sudan – to be determined later, due to the absence of a Sudanese delegation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The role of the various Islamic conventions is the coordination of cooperation
between different groups, the definition of common policies, and, occasionally,
the coordination of joint activities. These conventions, particularly the
ones organized by groups close to the Islamic trend of the Muslim Brotherhood,
often serve as an alternative to the lack of an international Islamic body
with permanent institutions. It would seem that this convention was held
also as part of an effort to establish such a body and to unify the efforts
to solve the main problems of the Muslim world. This goal can be better
seen in the “<a href="http://www.jamaat.org/news/pr102898.html" target="_new">International
Declaration</a>” of the convention, as published on the official site of
the Pakistani Islamic Group. The declaration emphasizes, among other things,
the socio-political agenda of the Muslim Brotherhood, which for many years
has been accepted by the Pakistani Islamic Group: “The target of the Islamic
Movements is to establish the true model of Islam. This Convention also makes it expressly open, that the primary target of the Muslim World is to correct and reform its own house.”
<p>The convention also established the priority of the main problems of
the Muslims:
<ol>
<li>
The liberation of Palestine as the duty of the whole Muslim World and by
struggle that “will be continued as long as needed.”</li>

<li>
The ensuring of self-determination for the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir
by the resistance movement there as a “target never to be compromised.”</li>

<li>
The freedom of the Muslims in Kosovo.</li>
</ol>
The convention determined the struggle against India, Israel, Serbia and
Eriteria as a <i>Jihad</i>. This means that the Islamic movements should
not only support the Muslims that are oppressed there, but “Press to the
world community to exert all possible political, economic and diplomatic
pressures against these nations.”
<p>But, despite the international declaration of the convention, it seems
that we are still a long ways from the establishment of an international
body of the Islamic movements, even those which toe the party line of the
Muslim Brotherhood. All that can be done, at least in the near future,
is the creation of solidarity—but not an institution with the power of
execution. The only happening of international significance here was the
definition of the Islamic struggles in Palestine, Kashmir, Kosovo and Eriteria
as a <i>Jihad</i>, which means the solidarity with and the legitimacy of
the Islamic terrorist activity in those places.
<p>An interesting element in the above-mentioned convention is the participation
of Hamas for the first time in the convention. It marks the expanding relations
of the Palestinian Islamic movement with other Islamic groups and movements,
especially in the Asiatic region of the Muslim world.
