<P><A NAME="Introduction"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Introduction</FONT></B>
<BR>For many years, terrorism was perceived as a contest between two sides:
on the one hand, a group of people or an organization, and on the other,
a sovereign state. However, during the course of the second half of the
twentieth century, various countries began to use, and indeed have expanded
their use of terrorist organizations to promote state interests in the
international domain. Instead of the "weapon of the weak" - minority groups,
liberation movements, and revolutionary organizations - terrorism has become
a tool of states and even of superpowers. In some cases, states established
"puppet" terrorist organizations, whose purpose was to act on behalf of
the sponsoring state, to further the interests of the state, and to represent
its positions in domestic or regional fronts. In other cases, states sponsored
or supported existing organizations, thereby creating mutually profitable
connections.

<P>The patron state provided its beneficiary terrorist organization with
political support, financial assistance, and the sponsorship necessary
to maintain and expand the struggle until the attainment of its objectives
had been achieved. The patron used the beneficiary to perpetrate acts of
terrorism as a means of spreading the former’s ideology throughout the
word, or in other cases, the patron ultimately expected that the beneficiary
would assume control over the state in which it resided or impart its ideology
to broad sections of the general public.

<P>According to Ray S. Cline and Yonah Alexander, state sponsored terrorism
aims "to achieve strategic ends in circumstances where the use of conventional
armed forces is deemed inappropriate, ineffective, too risky, or too difficult."
The high costs of modern warfare, the Cold War, and concern about non-conventional
escalation, as well as the danger of defeat and the unwillingness to appear
as the aggressor, have turned terrorism into an efficient, convenient,
and generally discrete weapon for attaining state interests in the international
realm.

<P>State support for terrorism has led to greater cooperation between organizations
in countries throughout the world, even in cases where ideological affinity
was minimal. The Soviet Union was among the first to sponsor a variety
of terrorist organizations, either directly or through its satellite states,
although with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Iran has assumed leadership
in the terrorism sponsorship field, both through direct and (primarily)
indirect means. Considering the level and scope of its involvement in terrorist
activities, post-Pahlavian Iran has become the leading force in state sponsored
terrorism.

<P><A NAME="Report on State-Sponsored Terrorism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Report
on State-Sponsored Terrorism</FONT></B>
<BR>Recognizing the centrality and the vast influence of terrorism patrons
on the scope and character of terrorist attacks throughout the world, the
United States tracks these states on an ongoing basis and publishes an
annual report of their activities. Inclusion in the report forbids American
companies from trading with countries on the list, and excludes them from
U.S. military or economic assistance, with the exception of humanitarian
aid.

<P>The chapter "State Sponsored Terrorism" in the 1993 report states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>International terrorism would not have flourished as it
has during the past few decades without the funding, training, safe haven,
weapons, and logistic support provided to terrorists by sovereign states.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The 1994 report proceeds to emphasize that this aid "is crucial to the
operation of many international terrorist organizations." Going back to
the 1993 report, we learn,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>For this reason, a primary aim of our counterterrorism policy
has been to apply pressure on such states to cease and desist in that support
and to make them pay the cost if they persist. We do this by publicly identifying
state sponsors and by imposing economic, diplomatic, and sometimes military
sanctions.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The American list relates, as noted, to states sponsoring international
terrorism, namely, terrorism directed against citizens of another country,
or against expatriates living abroad. (Hence, the American list does not
relate to domestic violence performed by official agencies). A review of
the reports for the last few years reveals that the list is constant; Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria make up its members.

<BR><A NAME="State Involvment in Terrorist Attacks"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>State
Involvement in Terrorist Attacks</FONT></B>
<BR>Diagram 1 maps international terrorist attacks in an attempt to clarify
the features characterizing state involvement in these attacks. The diagram
shows that terrorist attacks reflects a variety of possible combinations:
the interests of a state as opposed of a terrorist organization, and state
support for attacks as opposed to self-sufficient organizational action.

<P>In general, terrorist attacks can be divided into two groups according
to the perpetrating agency: attacks by terrorist organizations (colored
gray in the diagram), and attacks perpetrated directly by official state
institutions or their agents - security forces, intelligence services,
and others (colored black in the diagram). Naturally, the former group
of attacks is considerably larger than the latter, both because states
prefer to avoid responsibility, and because terrorist organizations also
conduct operations without direct links, initiative, or support from states.

<P>Terrorist acts performed directly by a state are initiated by the state
in order to attain a specific interest of that state (see mark 1). Most
terrorist acts, however, are performed by terrorist organizations and result
from the attempt to pursue the interests of the terrorist group (marks
4-9), while a minority are meant to satisfy only the interests of the sponsoring
state (marks 2, 3). Some reflect a shared interest of the state and the
organization (marks 6-9), and of these some are state initiated (8, 9).

<P>Of attacks carried out by terrorist organizations, some involve direct
state support at the planning, preparatory or operational stages (marks
3, 5, 7 and 9).

<P>These attacks may be intended to achieve an interest of the organization
(mark 5), or an interest shared by the organization and the state (marks
7 and 9), or even merely to promote the interests of the sponsoring state
(mark 3). Attacks meant to attain an interest shared by both the state
and the organization may sometimes enjoy state support (7, 9).

<P>On the basis of diagram 1, we can classify terrorist attacks into several
groups, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Acts of terror initiated by the organization to advance its own interests
and without any state involvement.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Acts of terror initiated by the organization to promote its own interests,
with operational assistance from the state.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Acts of terror initiated by the state to promote the interests of the state
or a shared interest (at times with operational assistance from the state).</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Acts of terror executed by the state or its agents in order to achieve
its own interests.</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="Types of State Involvement in International Terrorism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Types
of State Involvement in International Terrorism</FONT></B>
<BR>States are involved in terrorism in a variety of ways, from various
levels of general assistance, to operational aid, to initiating and directing
a terrorist organization’s activities, and up to direct attacks perpetrated
by official state agencies. Such forms of involvement classify states as
"states supporting terrorism or "terrorist states." The second category
has become a political weapon used by states to describe their rivals or
by terrorist organizations against opposing countries.

<P>Cline and Alexander suggested a definition of state sponsored terrorism:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The deliberate employment of violence or the threat of use
of violence by sovereign states (or sub-national groups encouraged or assisted
by sovereign states) to attain strategic and political objectives by acts
in violation of law. These criminal acts are intended to create overwhelming
fear in a target population larger than the civilian or military victims
attached or threatened.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of legal factors in this definition makes it problematic and highlights
the difficulties surrounding the study of the subject at hand. Laws and
legal systems are the products of state action and are open to state interpretation.
As such, terrorism defined as law infringement is dependent on the subjective
nature of legal interpretation. States can therefore deny their involvement
in terrorism by claiming that their actions are legal according to their
legal systems. Nor is international law sufficiently developed to be of
use in this definition. Furthermore, as noted, there are various kinds
of state involvement in terrorism and, therefore, we must also define states
according to their level of involvement

<P><B><I>Ideological Support</I></B>
<BR>The basic level of state support for terrorism is "ideological support."
Terrorist organizations, as noted, are a convenient instrument for spreading
ideological doctrines, particularly revolutionary ones. States such as
the Soviet Union and Iran, which set themselves the operative-strategic
aim of spreading their revolutionary ideology (Communism in the former
case and Islamic fundamentalism in the latter) found suitable allies in
terrorist organizations.

<P>In some cases, however, terrorist organizations were founded by extreme
radical activists, who were inspired to found their group by a state which
supported terrorism or who had accepted the ideological sponsorship of
a state sponsor in an effort to attain material assistance, after having
already founded their organization. In such cases, the terrorist organization
is provided with political, ideological or religious indoctrination via
agents of the supporting state or is trained by institutions of the sponsoring
state. (In this context one should mention communist terrorist organizations,
such as the "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine," which enjoyed
support from the Soviet Union, and organizations with an Islamic fundamentalist
outlook, such as Hizballah, with close ideological and religious ties to
Iran).

<P><B><I>Financial Support</I></B>
<BR>A higher level of state support for a terrorist organization is "financial
support." In order to continue operations and develop further, a terrorist
organization requires large sums of money, which are sometimes unavailable
through its own independent resources. In such cases, terrorist organizations
rely on the generous support of sponsoring states. Today Iran is one of
the main contributors to terrorist organizations. Thus, it has recently
been reported that Iran’s terrorist assistance budget has reached 100 million
dollars a year (of which 60 to 70 million are transferred to Hizballah).
These funds are appropriated to terrorist organizations through the "Office
of Revolutionary Movements," which is responsible, <I>inter alia</I>, for
transferring funds to Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and other groups and organizations.

in terrorist attacks. Part II classifies states according to their level
of involvement.</FONT></I>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<B><I>Military Support</I></B>
<BR>A higher level of aid involves "military support." Within this framework,
the state supplies the terrorist organization with a broad range of weapons,
provides military training, organizes courses for activists, and so on.
Iran also falls in this category. For instance, Hassan Salame (a Hamas
leader responsible for several suicide attacks in Israel, who was arrested
in mid-1996) reported that he had trained in Iran. His disclosure confirms
many accounts about an extensive military and operational training network
in Iranian facilities for members of terrorist organizations and extremist
groups from all over the world.

<P><B><I>Operational Support</I></B>
<BR>The next level of aid is "operational support." It entails the direct
provision of state assistance in the perpetration of specific attacks.
Operational support takes various forms: false documents, special weapons,
safe havens, etc. Iranian embassies throughout the world, for instance,
play a crucial role in this context. At times, Iranian embassies provide
terrorist cells with weapons (transported through diplomatic mail), money,
passports and visas, or recruit collaborators from within the Islamic community
of the states in which the embassies are located, for the purpose of aiding
the terrorists.

<P><B><I>Initiating Terrorist Attacks</I></B>
<BR>The next level of state involvement in terrorism is "initiating and
directing terrorist attacks." In this category, the state no longer limits
itself to providing aid indirectly to terrorist organizations. Instead,
it gives specific instructions concerning attacks, it initiates terrorist
activities, and it sets their aims.&nbsp; In this context, the remarks
made by former-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres are significant:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Let it be clear - Iran finances, trains, directs, and pressures
Hizballah to perform these attacks and hurt innocent victims . . . We know
that Iran has been exerting pressure to strike targets within Israel, as
well as Jewish and Israeli targets abroad.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is worth noting that the Italian newspaper <I>Corriere della Sera, </I>relying
on Egyptian sources, reported that a conference of Islamic terrorist organizations,
sponsored by Iranian intelligence services, convened in Iran in mid-June
1996. At the conference, it was decided to create a monthly forum based
in Iran to coordinate positions and obtain the authorization of Iranian
secret services for terrorist activities.

<P><B><I>Direct Involvement in Terrorist Attacks</I></B>
<BR>The highest level of state involvement in terrorism is "perpetrating
direct attacks by government agencies." In these cases, the state carries
out terrorist attacks in order to further its interests, using agencies
from its own intelligence services and security forces, or through people
directly responsible to them. Iranian involvement can also be found in
this category, specifically regarding attacks on Iranian exiles in Europe.
Thus, for instance, in may 1996 an Iranian intelligence agent was arrested
in Germany for the murder in Paris of Reza Masluman (a former minister
in the Shah regime and a leading member of the Iranian opposition). In
another instance, four Lebanese and one Iranian were tried for the 1992
assassination of four Kurdish leading members of the Iranian opposition,
at the Mikonos restaurant in Berlin. The former-Iranian president, Abdel
Hassan Banisader, who testified at their trial in Berlin, accused the Iranian
leaders, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Khamenei, of personal involvement
in the murders. He reported he had received this information from a former
top agent in Iranian intelligence who had defected. According to this source,
Khamenei authorized the murder in writing, while Rafsanjani was involved
at the planning stage, three months before its execution.

<P>Iran is not the only country which executes terrorist activities through
its own official agencies. Direct Libyan involvement in terrorist activities
deserves mention in this context. For example, a French judge recently
declared -- following a prolonged investigation (parts of which were carried
out in Libya) of the explosion of a UTA-owned (France) airplane over the
Sahara Desert in 1989, in which all 170 passengers and crew were killed
-- that leading figures in Libyan intelligence stood behind the incident.
The judge issued two international arrest warrants against Libyans for
their involvement in preparing and transporting the bomb, and intends to
prosecute them in absencia.

<P>The pyramidal structure of the diagram serves to illustrate the degree
of state involvement in terrorism. The basis of the pyramid marks more
limited involvement, while the apex indicates the highest level of state
involvement in terrorism. The ascent along the various levels of the pyramid
reflects state implication at rising levels of support and assistance.
The use of the pyramid also illustrates the scope of the phenomenon. The
farther up the pyramid one goes, the fewer are the groups and organizations
which enjoy heightened levels of state support.

<P>In Part II of Diagram 2, states are classified according to their level
of involvement in international terrorism. At the basis of the pyramid,
reflecting the lowest level of terrorism involvement (from an international
perspective), is the "terrorist state" -- a state that systematically and
purposefully brings violence to bear on its citizens, going so far as to
oppress civil society within its borders. Not all states that disregard
their citizens’ rights or establish dictatorial or autocratic regimes are
sponsors of international terrorism, however it is safe to assume that
states which sponsor international terrorism are involved, to some extent,
in the oppression of some sectors or strata of their own societies, as
well.

<P>At the next level of the pyramid is the "state supporting terrorism"
- a state that supports terrorist organizations, aiding them in their activities
according to the levels of support described in part I of the second diagram
(see above).

<P>A higher level of involvement comes to the fore in the activities of
a "state operating terrorism" - a state which initiates, directs and performs
terrorist activities through groups outside its institutions.

<P>The highest level of involvement in international terrorism is represented
by the category "state perpetrating terrorism." At this level are countries
which execute terrorist acts abroad through its own official bodies (members
of its security forces or intelligence services, or their direct agents).
Such states intentionally engage in attacks against citizens in the territories
of foreign countries in order to achieve political aims and goals, without
declaring a state of war. (According to international conventions, acts
of intentional aggression committed against citizens by official agencies
of a state, either in a state of war or in occupied territories, are considered
war crimes rather than terrorism).

<P>The levels of the pyramid represent degrees of involvement in international
terrorism: i.e., the higher up the pyramid, the greater and deeper the
involvement. In addition, and similar to part I, the pyramidal structure
also illustrates the number of states sponsoring international terrorism
-- the greater the involvement (as we ascend the pyramid), the smaller
the number of relevant states.

<P><A NAME="Rationality of States Involvement in Terrorism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rationality
of States Involvement in Terrorism</FONT></B>
<BR>Having established the various features of state sponsorship of international
terrorism, we are faced with determining the possibility of preventing
states interested in assisting terrorist organizations or in perpetrating
terrorist acts on their own. Before turning to this issue, however, we
must determine the extent to which one can view the decision to engage
in terrorist activities as a rational act.

<P>The most widely accepted strategy for coping with terrorism in general,
and with states involved in terrorism in particular, is deterrence. However,
if the state’s decision to sponsor terrorism does not follow from rational
considerations, deterrent activities against it will be meaningless. Indeed,
a policy of retribution against irrational states might be ineffective,
and could even lead to further escalation. Prof. Yehezkel Dror, of Hebrew
University, emphasizes that deterrence is a weak and indeed irrelevant
strategy in coping with a "crazy state." He writes,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>[A]s the fear of sanctions will not affect its behavior...
deterrence by threatening to harm targets that appear important to the
deterring state could be irrelevant to the ‘crazy’ state, which has different
targets and values.... A prominent feature of a ‘crazy state’ is its risk
proneness...</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Nevertheless, Dror asserts,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Except for these extreme cases (of states ready for self-sacrifice),
which one cannot assume will actually materialize, deterrence might be
the preferred sub-strategy against their madness...</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Most states engaged in terrorism choose to do so. They take into account
the price they will be required to pay for their activity, in exchange
for the benefits gained by the attainment of their policy goals. Usually,
these states adhere to rational cost-benefit analyses. Indeed, most countries
which sponsor terrorism are not democratic, and their decision-making processes
are limited to the consideration of a single ruler. The variables entering
the cost and benefits equation in such cases might seem irrational to Western
sensibilities, as they seemingly assign exaggerated and disproportionate
weight to ideology, religion, and emotions. But even the lone decision
maker tests the extent to which his activity will ultimately promote his
goals, as he himself has defined them, and whether countermeasures adopted
against his country, if and when its involvement in terrorism is disclosed,
will endanger his and his country’s basic interests.

<P>For every country, there is a limit to the amount it willing to pay
for its continued involvement in terrorism. The price scale varies from
country to country, as does each one’s "breaking point." Hence, in order
for deterrence to be successful, countries contending with terrorism must
raise the costs of terrorism involvement to the point where the costs outweigh
the benefits, and they must do so according to the specific characteristics
of the individual state sponsors.

<P>What is the range of activities available in the deterrence of states
sponsoring terrorist activities? What is the "price scale" that the international
community can endorse in an attempt to alter the costs and benefits analysis
of those states which are involved in terrorism?

<P><A NAME="The &quot;Price Scale&quot;"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The "Price
Scale"</FONT></B>
<BR>Diagram 3 specifies deterrent options against states engaged in terrorism.
The diagram reflects a rising scale of prices of international efforts,
each one conveying a more stringent sanction than the previous one, beginning
with a warning to cease terrorism sponsorship, to international condemnation
and cultural boycott (including banning the sponsor from international
events, removing it from international cultural or educational programs,
and the expulsion of its citizens who live, work, or study in other countries).
The next stage is a diplomatic boycott, including the removal of terrorism
sponsors from international institutions, the suspension of its membership
in UN institutions, removal from the UN General Assembly and even a cessation
of bilateral relations (no country has ever been expelled from the UN).
At the next stage (or parallel to the previous one) is an economic boycott.
Such a measure could include restricting the state’s ability to purchase
military or dual-use equipment (in a military conflict or in its involvement
in terrorism), preventing exports to it and purchases from it, freezing
and confiscating its assets throughout the world, and the construction
of a blockade, by air, land and sea. In addition, a secondary boycott could
be imposed on countries and companies which insist on maintaining commercial
ties with the sponsor. The next phase is the legal stage. Here, the sponsoring
state’s political and military leaders are defined as "war criminals" or
charged with "crimes against humanity," with international show trials
set to punish them (even if not in their presence). The highest stage of
punishment and deterrence against a state sponsoring terrorism is the offensive
stage - international coordinated military actions against the terrorist
organization’s facilities in the sponsoring country and the sponsor’s military
installations.

<P><A NAME="Adjusting the &quot;Price&quot; to Involvement in Terrorism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Adjusting
the Price of Involvement in Terrorism</FONT></B>
<BR>Sorting out states according to their level of involvement is an efficient
way of arriving at a clear and defined international strategy against states
which sponsor and perpetrate terrorism. Classifying these states and adjusting
the punishment to their crimes will cause some to reconsider their involvement
in terrorism and to reevaluate the costs and benefits of continued or increased
involvement in terrorism.

<P>Clearly, it is neither necessary nor justified to adopt all the punitive
and deterrent measures available against all countries involved in terrorism.
They must be adjusted to the level of involvement and the characteristics
of the countries involved in terrorist attacks. Thus, for instance, against
states "supporting terrorism" (helping terrorist organizations indirectly),
a warning, a condemnation, and a cultural and diplomatic boycott might
suffice, whereas against states that "operate terrorism" (initiate attacks
and execute them through other groups and organizations), one might consider
an economic boycott and even legal action. Against states "performing terrorism"
(executing terrorist attacks through their own intelligence and security
services and their agents), it may be necessary to adopt offensive measures.

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../graphics/diagram3.GIF" HEIGHT=238 WIDTH=270></CENTER>
<I><FONT SIZE=-1>Diagram 3. It should be stressed that the diagram only
brings examples of punitive and deterrent measures against countries involved
in terrorism. One can add or detract steps according to the features of
the country at stake, the estimated effectiveness of these actions, and
the current international situation.</FONT></I>

<P>The "punitive price scale" adopted against states engaged in terrorism
must be clear, explicit, and consistent. No measure should be chosen randomly.
Only when the terror sponsor is aware <I>a priori</I> of the price to be
exacted for its continued involvement in terrorism, and only when it can
be persuaded that the international community is determined in its stance,
will the deterrent measures succeed. The way to deter a state from engaging
in terrorism or supporting terrorist organizations is to clarify <I>a priori</I>
that the price of these activities will be higher than the benefits of
terrorism sponsorship, and that the price has indeed been exacted.

<P><A NAME="International Measures against Terrorism"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>International
Measures against Terrorism</FONT></B>
<BR>In the past, when punitive measures were used against terrorism sponsors,
they were employed randomly, by either one or several countries and at
times relying on UN resolutions while at others not. However, they were
not used as part of a clearly defined "price scale." Thus, in 1986, following
the disclosure of Syria’s direct involvement in Hindawi’s plan to blow
up an El-Al plane bound for Tel-Aviv, the Bonn federal government adopted
a series of measures against Syria, among them: imposing restrictions on
Syria’s German embassy, Syrian airlines, and on Syrian nationals in Germany.
The sending of Germany’s ambassador to Damascus was also suspended. In
addition, France and Germany decided on punitive steps against Syria, after
a British motion for joint sanctions was rejected at a Luxembourg meeting
of foreign ministers of the European Common Market. Concurrently, Britain
vetoed a five-year aid package worth 140 million dollars that the European
Common Market had intended for Syria. The British foreign secretary, Sir
Jeffrey Howe, said that "Britain is not prepared to continue financial
aid to Syria in the present circumstances."

<P>Some of the more prominent measures adopted against terrorism have been
levied against Libya. Following the disclosure of Libyan involvement in
various terrorist acts (including against American troops), the United
States bombed targets in the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Bengazi in 1986.

<P>In April 1991, due to Libya’s continued involvement in terrorism and,
specifically, its refusal to extradite the Libyan security personnel suspected
of involvement in two attacks on passenger planes that resulted in hundreds
of deaths (the Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie and the French UTA plane in
the Sahara desert), the Security Council, following an American initiative,
imposed sanctions on Libya that included a ban on commercial flights, an
arms embargo, a restriction of the transfer of technical information, and
other measures. As Libya continued its refusal to bow to international
pressure, the Security Council stepped-up its punitive efforts, and imposed
air blockade. In the resolution (Number 748), Libya is required to undertake
an explicit commitment to desist from any terrorist activity and stop any
aid to terrorist organizations. The Security Council also called upon members
of the United Nations to stop supplying Libya with weapons, to reduce the
number of Libyan diplomatic representatives, and to limit the movements
of Libyan diplomats within the territories of their host countries. This
was the first time the UN used its power to impose sanctions against a
country accused of international terrorism (the resolution was approved
by a majority of ten, with five abstentions).

<P>Later, in November 1993, the Security Council adopted an additional
resolution (Number 883) against Libya, which re-ratified the previous one
(this time with a majority of eleven and four abstentions). The new resolution
called for the freezing of funds and economic assets owned or controlled
by the Libyan government, a ban on the supply of drilling equipment to
Libya, and other steps. The resolution also stated that the sanctions against
Libya would be suspended if Libya were to meet the Security Council’s demands,
namely requiring the suspects in the Lockerbie incident to attended their
trial and cooperating with official French agencies investigating the UTA
affair.

<P><A NAME="Conflicts of Interests"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Conflicts of Interests</FONT></B>
<BR>The struggle against states involved in terrorism reflects many conflicts
of interests in the international arena - between states and superpowers,
alliances and leagues of states, groups, and organizations. At times, however,
the counter terrorism effort creates conflicts of interests within a state,
between its security and economic interests. Thus far, economic interests
have had the upper hand, whereas security interests, expressed in the will
for a more effective struggle against states engaging in terrorism, have
been relegated second class status.

<P>In a study published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy,
Michael Eisensdadt specifies the scope to which countries with extensive
commercial ties with Iran were involved in export activity during 1994.
Heading the list is Germany, with exports of 1,737 billion dollars. Japanese
exports to Iran totaled one billion dollars, French exports - 907 million
dollars, exports from Italy - 787 million dollars, Turkey - 294 million
dollars, China - 292 million dollars, and Holland - 259 million dollars.
It is worth noting that American companies also continued trading with
Iran, exporting on a scale of 362 million dollars. Heading the list of
countries receiving Iranian goods (particularly oil) is Japan, about 2.5
billion dollars, followed by Korea with 1.2 billion dollars and Italy with
925 million dollars.

<P>An analysis of the international measures adopted against countries
involved in terrorism reveals that most states are unwilling to sacrifice
their economic interests for the cessation of terrorism. The most prominent
example of such a tendency can be found in the attitude of European states
(headed by Germany, France and Italy) toward Iran, the world’s leading
terrorism sponsor. Contrary to the American approach, which is intended
to restrict Iranian activities and to force it to abandon terrorism by
further damaging Iran’s precarious economy with additional sanctions, the
countries of Europe have relied on a varied set of practical arguments
to justify their extensive economic and commercial ties with Iran.

<P><A NAME="Secondary Boycott -- The D’Amato Law"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Secondary
Boycott - The D’Amato Law</FONT></B>
<BR>Differences between the United States and Europe have come to the fore
in the tensions surrounding the American legislation which imposes sanctions
on any company which invests more than 40 million dollars a year in the
oil, gas or petrochemical industries of Iran or Libya. The law - known
as the D’Amato Law, after its sponsor, New York Republican Senator Alfonso
D’Amato - was unanimously approved by the House of Representatives in July
1996, and its purpose was to cause damages to companies investing in these
countries. The law compels the President, <I>inter alia, </I>to block imports
originated in these companies from entering the United States, to prevent
these companies from receiving loans in excess of 10 million dollars a
year from American financial bodies, to forbid American government bodies
to purchase goods from them. The law also calls on the president to establish
contacts with America’s allies in an effort to reach multilateral agreements
forbidding trade with, and investments in, Iran and Libya. (The D’Amato
Law was proceeded by the successful introduction of restrictions on American
business involvement with Iran and Libya and the signing of a of a similar
law against Cuba - the Helmes-Burton Law, which raised controversy in Canada,
Mexico, and among members of the European Union). Following the signing
of the D’Amato Law, President Clinton declared that "terrorism is the enemy
of our generation," and:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Every advanced country is going to have to make up its mind
whether it can do business with people by day who turn around and fuel
attacks on their innocent civilians by night. That’s a decision that every
country will have to make.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
President Clinton added:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>From the skies over Lockerbie to Khobar Towers, from the
World Trade Center to Centennial Park, America has felt the pain of terrorism
abroad and at home. From the Tokyo subway to the streets of Tel-Aviv, we
know that no nation is immune.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
President Clinton stressed that protecting the economic and political interests
of the United States compels it to lead the struggle against international
terrorism.

<P>The D’Amato Law, however, soon evoked anger in Europe. Protests and
even threats of retaliation against the United States were voiced in various
European capitals. An official statement by French Ministry of Foreign
Affairs stated that the new American law was a brazen infringement of international
rules of trade, and that France, like its other European partners, would
not bow to such dictates. Sir Leon Brittan, the EU Trade Commissioner,
said in this regard:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>[The D’Amato Law] establishes the unwelcome principle that
one country can dictate the foreign policy of others, and disturbs the
unity of purpose between allies that is so necessary if we are to stamp
out terrorism successfully together.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkell, stated:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The American law and programs breach fundamental principles
of international trade and of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, and we hereby announce that we will not accept them.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
The American initiative faced opposition beyond Europe as well. The Japanese
government expressed regret at the passing of the law, and called on the
United States to reconsider it. The spokesman for the Japanese delegation
to the G-7 summit in Lyon, Hiroshi Hashimoto, stressed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>As a matter of principle, we have many reservations, principled
reservations, about extraterritoriality of a domestic law to the outside
countries. We think that it is against international law.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Australian Trade Minister, Tim Fischer, stated that his country would take
all the necessary steps to oppose the implementation of the American law.
In his view, Australia strongly condemns terrorism but, "imposing sanctions
against innocent countries and companies is a misguided principle that
could harm Australian trade." The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman added:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The measures adopted by the United States are incompatible
with the code regulating international relations, and will solve nothing.
No one can systematically use sanctions and pressure to solve this type
of problem.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Andreiev, stated:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>We are in need of practical steps to broaden international
cooperation against terrorism, but not of unilateral steps that violate
the law.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The D’Amato Law was labeled as inconsistent with international agreements
and the rules governing international trade. Such claims, however, are
not completely unfounded. True, the D’Amato-sponsored legislation is a
secondary boycott, and as such, it does limit free international trade
by introducing political considerations into the formulation of trade procedures.
However, the law reflects a more important international need. It attempts
to close the loopholes of international sanctions imposed against countries
involved in terrorism. Without punishing those who violate these international
sanctions, sanctions cannot be enacted.

<P>Indeed, criticism of the D’Amato Law points to the urgent need to modify
international agreements so as to make them compatible with a law of this
type. When trade agreements were signed, the extent to which international
terrorism would come to endanger both world peace and the safety of the
world’s citizens could not have been foreseen.

<P>In today’s world, trade agreements must allow for the enabling of an
efficient struggle against countries engaged in terrorism. These agreements
are designed to regulate and maintain international economic exchange,
while anti-terrorism efforts are designed to ensure the continued safety
of the international community as a whole.

<P>If there is room for criticism against the D’Amato Law, it concerns
the legislation’s provision of only imposing sanctions against companies
which invest more than 40 million dollars a year in Iran and Libya. Such
a sum leaves a significant amount of room for companies interested in continuing
their investment, and in maintaining broad economic links with these countries.

<P>Encouraged by the broad international criticism of American measures,
the Iranian Oil Minister announced that the sanctions would have no effect
on his country’s oil production -- "our oil industry has never been in
better shape and there is no concern regarding the future." Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati added that his country "is not afraid of an
American boycott that will have no effect on the economic situation in
Iran." Iran even went so far as to submit a claim against the United States
at the Iranian-American arbitration tribunal at the Hague. Iran requested
that the court ratify preventive measures to restrain the United States
from enacting the D’Amato Law.

<P><A NAME="The &quot;Critical Dialogue&quot; -- A Utilitarian Argument"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The
"Critical Dialogue" - A Utilitarian Argument</FONT></B>
<BR>Countries maintaining extensive economic links with states involved
in terrorism choose to justify their policy in utilitarian-international
terms rather than in economic ones. Their claim is that imposing sanctions
on such states will not lead them to restrict their sponsorship of terrorism.
Indeed they claim that the opposite will result, and such policies will
corner them into even more extreme, violent tactics and a further escalation
of international terrorism. According to such an outlook, the preferred
policy is one of "critical dialogue" - keeping channels open with states
sponsoring terrorism by maintaining economic and cultural links with them.
Such "open channels" can be used as a means to voice criticism of terrorism
policies and to influence terrorism sponsors against the continuation of
their sponsorship.

<P>Some countries opposed to the policy of "critical dialogue" use the
services of its proponents as negotiators, in efforts to release hostages,
to apply pressure on beneficiary terrorist organizations, and so forth.
In so doing, they subvert their own efforts, erode the moral grounds of
their opposition to this policy, and nullify any criticism against countries
that endorse it.

<P>Thus, for instance, American requests from Germany to intercede with
Iran to release American hostages, as well as Israeli requests for German
intervention in returning the bodies of Israeli MIA’s from the Lebanon
war and in the release of the navigator Ron Arad, could be used by Germany
to vindicate its policy of "critical dialogue" with Iran. The mediation
tasks assigned to these countries grant them "clearance" to continue their
extensive ties with Iran and terrorism sponsors, and frustrates the efforts
to come to a joint international strategy in the struggle against terrorism
sponsors.

<P>At the Paris summit of the industrialized countries (G-7), in August
1996, which dealt with international terrorism, the Europeans blocked an
American attempt to impose sanctions on four terrorism sponsoring states
-- Iran, Libya, Iraq and Sudan. The European participants claimed that
isolating countries such as Iran has no moderating influence whatsoever
on terrorism, but rather the opposite. In support of their "critical dialogue"
approach, they claimed they can make ingenious use of the "carrot and stick"
approach, thereby preserving the effectiveness of their own actions against
terrorism sponsors.

<P>To test these claims one must return to the premise that states engaged
in terrorism, like other states, rely on a rational cost-benefit analyses.
When the "critical dialogue" countries assume that imposing sanctions on
states sponsoring terrorism is ineffective they imply that "stick" measures
are <I>a priori</I> doomed to fail. Hence, only the "carrot" is left from
the "carrot and stick" approach -- sustaining commercial and economic ties
with these states. However, barring sanctions and rejecting the imposition
of painful measures prevents the cost element from increasing, thereby
maintaining the previous balance of the cost-benefit calculus. Thus, a
terrorism sponsor is not induced to change his policies.

<P><A NAME="Buying Silence -- The Security Argument"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Buying
Silence - The Security Argument</FONT></B>
<BR>As previously mentioned, critics of the use of sanctions often claim
that imposing sanctions on state engaged in terrorism closes channels of
communication and may

<P>lead to escalation. This claim is compatible with another conciliatory
strategy toward terrorists, mainly that which support a "dialogue" with
terrorist organizations in an attempt to influence their policies. Such
a policy is in effect "buying silence." In such cases, a terrorist organization
(or sponsor) agrees to refrain from carrying out attacks within the borders
of a certain country, in exchange for a commitment by that country to turn
a blind eye to terrorist activities of the organization or the ideological
influence or support of the sponsor. In so doing, the country conceals
the responsibility of the organization or its sponsor, and can even prevent
the extradition of terrorists caught in that country or lead to the release
of terrorists without, or shortly after a trial.

<P>Such a strategy is opportunist at best. It promotes particularistic
interests while jeopardizing the safety of the entire international community
and of other sovereign states. It also hampers all chances of effective
international cooperation in the struggle against terrorism; it defeats
the international effort to coerce terrorism sponsors to refrain from further
involvement in the use of terror. However, this strategy does not justify
the hopes of those that "buy silence." Such efforts rely, as noted, on
the premise that this policy will serve the security interests of the country
which adopts it (by limiting the number of attacks perpetrated within its
territory) as well as its economic goals (by expanding the economic ties
with the state sponsoring terrorism). This estimate, however, appears to
be wrong in the short, as well as the long term.

<P>From a security point of view, there is ample evidence that organizations
and states have not refrained from carrying out terrorist attacks and other
subversive activities against countries with which they maintain good relations.
Thus, for instance, evidence has recently emerged of Iranian involvement
in a terrorist attack against Kurdish exiles in Germany, and proof was
offered of Iranian involvement in the murder in France of Shahpur Bakhtiar,
a former-Iranian prime minister.

<P>Nor does "buying silence" appear to be economically profitable, even
if in the relative short term. Investments in countries with revolutionary
regimes such as Iran, Libya, and others, are very risky and subject to
instantaneous cancellation, if and when a regime decides, for instance,
to nationalize foreign economic institutions and confiscate their assets,
or to default on foreign loans.

<P>Long term economic interests are equally at risk. States which sponsor
terrorism generally support a broad range of terrorist organizations throughout
the world, and their control over some of them is sometimes rather lax.
Sponsors kindle the revolutionary fire of various organizations, although
sometimes these fires can be difficult to control. For example, the deliberate
disregard of Iran’s terrorist activities and of its policy of "spreading
the revolution" supports the expansion of Islamic fundamentalism. In so
doing, those countries which maintain extensive commercial ties with Iran
may someday face the possibility of coping with radical or even violent
fundamentalist elements within their own Islamic communities.

<P>Furthermore, the spread of international terrorism is not healthy for
the international balance of power and hampers commercial and economic
stability. Brutal terrorist attacks (blowing up airplanes, attacking densely
populated centers, etc.) may lead to the collapse of large corporations
and provoke international chain reactions. These attacks could also spark
a large international conflagration and culminate in an acute international
crisis, and even in war.

<P>Finally, implementing a strategy of "buying silence" toward a state
involved in terrorism might evoke anger of friendly countries suffering
the consequences of terrorist activities, and thus undermine peripheral
bilateral relationships. Hence, a strategy of "buying silence" and maintaining
close commercial ties with terrorism sponsors is flawed, and may even entail
damages and heavy losses in the short term and certainly in the long.

<P><A NAME="Damage to the Population -- The Moral Argument"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Damage
to the Population - The Moral Argument</FONT></B>
<BR>Countries which maintain ties with terrorism sponsors sometimes justify
their decisions on grounds of justice and morality. They claim that targeting
the entire population of country for the policies adopted by a corrupt,
extreme, and violent regime is immoral. Thus, for instance, in the Paris
summit of the industrialized countries (G-7) in August 1996, France and
Germany argued against the U.S. that measures designed to "turn entire
populations into hostages" are cruel. But if considerations of justice
are indeed of issue, the pain of those who are attacked must be measured
against the suffering of the population in the state involved in terrorism.
Hence, if the damage caused to the former will limit or stop the state’s
sponsorship of terrorism, thus limiting the damage caused to victims of
terror, the bringing of pressure to bear on the entire country is justified.
Furthermore, the damage caused to the population of countries harmed by
terrorism far exceeds that suffered by the citizens of the sponsor. In
comparison to the inconvenience and the economic problems that may be caused
by sanctions, the victims are confronted with their own possible deaths.
In the balance of justice and morality, the choice is between the comforts
of life and the right to life. Hence, the moral claim of countries which
defend their ties with terrorism sponsors is groundless.

<P>Another claim raised in this context is that the application of communal
punishment is an ineffective means of preventing or deterring terrorism
or terrorism sponsorship. States which sponsor terrorism often have autocratic
or dictatorial regimes, and public opinion does not play a central role
in their internal political systems. Accordingly, pressuring the population
cannot bring about the desired results and may even radicalize the population
and spur additional volunteers to join the circle of violence. In addition,
considering the generally low standards of living in these countries (when
compared to the countries of the West), they are in a better position to
bear the pressure of economic sanctions.

<P>While on the surface these claims may seem valid, they are, in fact,
quite inaccurate. Sanctions imposed on a terrorism sponsor are not intended
to influence public opinion but rather the government. Economic sanctions
are meant to cause serious damage to the country’s economy and limit its
ability to direct the economic resources necessary to carry out terrorist
attacks or support terrorist organizations. Before economic sanctions affect
the population’s daily bread, they affect the regime’s ability to implement
costly projects, military and others, and compel the government to invest
time in finding solutions to the country’s economic problems. Moreover,
state sponsorship of terrorism usually involves the support of foreign
organizations, and/or the execution of terrorist operations through official
agencies belonging to the state’s security and intelligence services. Hence,
even if countries imposing sanctions evoke the population’s resentment,
their anger will be translated, first and foremost, into demonstrative
and organized protest activities against the sanctions, and not into involvement
in international terrorism. Furthermore, there is also a possibility that
the precarious economic situation and the ensuing rage within the sponsoring
state will provide fertile ground for the growth of opposition groups that
may ultimately take over the government and adopt a new anti-terror policy.

<P>Eisenstadt’s study shows that American economic sanctions imposed on
Iran successfully hampered Teheran’s efforts to become the dominant military
power in the Persian Gulf, and delayed Iran’s plan to attain a nuclear
capability. According to Banisader,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Europe lies when claiming it cannot force the Iranian regime
to respect human rights. Iran is economically dependent on Japan and Europe,
and a tougher stand can therefore compel changes in its policy.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
At the beginning of the nineties, Iran was at the height of a prolonged
economic crisis. Even after having expanded its oil production from 2.5
million barrels a day to 4.1 million, Iran was unable to finance the return
of its short-term loans, amounting to three billion dollars, which blocked
its access to credit designed to finance the import of technological goods
and raw materials for its industry. (The total Iranian debt to foreign
countries was estimated in 1993 to be about 40 billion dollars). Only the
willingness to delay payments shown by countries maintaining commercial
and economic ties with Iran saved the Iranian regime from economic collapse.
(Germany, for instance, agreed to renegotiate the Iran’s five billion dollar
debt).

<P><A NAME="Struggle against Terrorism as An American Interest"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Struggle
against Terrorism as An American Interest</FONT></B>
<BR>European countries voiced another claim against American counterterrorism
efforts. They argued that these efforts do not reflect an honest will to
fight terrorism but rather the selfish interests of the United States.
At the G-7 Paris summit (August 1996), France and Germany claimed that
the D`Amato Law was not really meant to make the war against terrorism
more efficient but rather to promote American interests in the world. As
proof, they raised the fact that the United States chose not to recommend
sanctions against Syria despite the latter’s sponsorship of terrorism,
because this might be counterproductive to current American interests.

<P>Ostensibly, the American report on state-sponsored terrorism is also
influenced by international political processes and has political overtones.
Thus, for instance, the 1996 report opens the paragraph relating to Syria
as follows: "There is no evidence that Syrian officials have been directly
involved in planning or executing terrorist attacks since 1986." The report
also states that Syria "continues to negotiate seriously to achieve a peace
accord with Israel and has taken some steps to restrain the international
activities of these groups." Right before the publication of the report,
in an exchange between the United States and Syria, the Secretary of State
emphasized that "Damascus has taken steps that may lead to a limitation
of terrorism... although not everything is perfect." He also pointed to
the ongoing dialogue with Damascus regarding the cessation of Syrian sponsorship
of terrorist headquarters in areas under Syrian control. In response to
the American inclusion of Syria in the list of states sponsoring terrorism,
Hafez Al Assad stated that Syria is opposed to terrorism as a criminal
activity, but said concerning the Hizballah actions in Lebanon:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>It is beyond belief that this is what is meant by ‘terrorism.’
We call criminals ‘terrorists,’ and it is inconceivable that a citizen
defending his homeland should be considered a "terrorist."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The Syrian president has long avoided any direct or indirect responsibility
for terrorism by deliberately changing the definition of terrorism, and
artificially distinguishing between a terrorist and a "freedom fighter."

<P>Another instance of American interests reflected in its list of states
sponsoring terrorism dates from 1982, when the United States first decided
to exclude Iraq (due to its desire to help Iraq in its war against Iran)
even though it was a well known sponsor of terrorist activities and organizations
- as became evident after the Iran-Iraq war.

<P>These exceptions, however, prove the rule that the American list is
the best and most efficient instrument available today for creating a jointly
organized international struggle against states which sponsor terrorism.
The United States has assumed a difficult and complex role which should
have been assumed by an international agency. However, irresponsibility
in the international system regarding this issue, due to the inclination
of individual countries to promote particularistic interests at the expense
of the entire international community’s safety, has forced the United States
to assume this role almost single-handedly. Indeed, rather than criticize
American "lack of objectivity," European countries should join the United
States in a united struggle against terrorism sponsors, thus "balancing"
American policies toward international terrorism.

<P>At the fourth summit conference of the International Democratic Union
in 1989, Margaret Thatcher noted the hypocrisy prevalent in the international
community’s attitude toward terrorism. She said that the world is willing
to forgive certain countries, as if civilized behavior were not expected
from them. In her view, the community is not tough enough against governments
that support terrorism. "A state cannot support terrorism and also enjoy
the treatment awarded to a regular member of the international community."

<P>The former British Foreign Minister, Sir Jeffrey Howe, concisely explained
the disparity between the declarations of Western countries against international
terrorism and its sponsors, and the translation of these declarations into
action. In a statement at a meeting of Common Market foreign ministers
in Luxembourg, (after European community members refused to support Great
Britain’s attempt to impose sanctions on Syria following the disclosure
of Syria’s direct involvement in the attempted attack on an El-Al plane
in London in 1986), Sir Jeffrey Howe said: "It seems that terrorist acts
perpetrated in one European country fail to echo in other European countries."

<P><A NAME="Breakdown of International Unity"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Breakdown
of International Unity</B></FONT>
<BR>International struggle against states which are involved in terrorism
should not be limited to the imposition of economic sanctions. Rather,
it should cover a full range of diplomatic, legal, economic, and offensive
actions. Ultimately, such measures will raise the costs of involvement
in terrorism, and therefore reduce the terrorism-related activities of
sponsoring states.

<P>Single (one-time) acts against a specific country, the lack of international
coordination and cooperation, and the hesitant statements by the world’s
states, merely strengthen the outlook that sponsoring terrorism can be
continued without fear, or that the punishment for such policies will remain
tolerable. This trend is evident in the attitude of the Iranian foreign
ministry toward the American D’Amato Law. It stated that "Clinton’s decision
enjoys no international support and is therefore doomed to fail."

<P>States sponsoring terrorism will resort to any means to find loopholes
in international boycotts and will seek out countries ready to maintain
cultural, diplomatic, and economic ties, either openly or surreptitiously.
In return, they will be ready to pay a high price and grant economic and
other benefits to anyone prepared to cooperate with them. Alternatively,
these states may threaten to harm foreign investments or assets within
their territories or execute massive acts of terrorism or even an all-out
war. In an attempt to break the international boycott imposed on them,
countries sponsoring terrorism may try to use ethnic, religious, national,
and other ties with other countries (perhaps a joint league or organization
of states) and request help within international judicial frameworks. In
this context, it is worth mentioning Libya’s appeal to the International
Court of Justice in the Hague in 1992. Libya sought an injunction against
Britain and the United States to forbid them from imposing sanctions. (This
request was denied, <I>inter alia,</I> because sanctions on Libya were
imposed in accordance with Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, Chapter
VII, which grants the Security Council sweeping authority to act so as
to preserve world peace and security, even in disregard of law and justice
considerations). At the same time Colonel Qadaffi, the Libyan leader, sent
telegrams to kings, presidents and sultans in various countries of the
world in protest of the Security Council motion:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Were the world to accept such a distortion of the United
Nations Charter and agree to adopt such a resolution, it would become a
world of natives and primitives. If we are different we must leave New
York, and separate from the United Nations as we did from the League of
Nations. This is clearly not a legal matter. The third world now faces
a new stage of colonialism.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Following the Libyan appeal, Syria lead an initiative to ease the boycott.
It raised a motion at a committee of Arab League ministers, meeting in
Cairo, to approach the Security Council and ask to be released from enacting
the anti-Libyan resolution, number 748. (This suggestion was based on Article
50 of the United Nations Charter, which states that if measures are taken
against a member state, any other state confronted with economic problems
due to these measures can explore solutions in consultation with the Security
Council). In this context, Syria argued that "being Arabs, we stand by
Libya, following the proposal made by the latter and accepted by the Arab
ministers. Libya has agreed to extradite its two citizens suspected of
involvement in the Lockerbie affair to a neutral state, so that they may
stand trial."

<P>The international community cannot agree to any breach in the international
boycott. The effectiveness of international punitive and deterrent measures
is severely hindered when countries and companies are willing to break
the international boycott to promote their own particularistic interests
or to preserve solidarity with their allies. To avoid this situation, the
international community must clarify that any state or corporation which
deliberately breaks the international boycott is liable to face secondary
boycott measures. The D’Amato law (although an internal American law) is
a first step in this direction.

<P><A NAME="An International Institution to Fight Terrorism"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>An
International Institution to Fight Terrorism</B></FONT>
<BR>Until the cost-benefit analysis for terrorism changes, it may remain
impossible to agree on a joint and effective international initiative to
fight terrorism. Only when countries in the free world estimate that the
struggle against countries which sponsor terrorism is more important than
other policy objectives will it be possible to force countries such as
Iran and Libya to limit their involvement in terrorism and to stop aiding
terrorist organizations. This balance of interests will only change when
terrorism goes beyond a certain threshold of damage and threats grow significantly.
In other words, the situation may have to become much worse before countries
in the world decide to endorse an effective initiative against states involvement
in terrorism.

<P>Only when terrorism affects high numbers of people in countries which
today turn a blind eye to the activity of terrorism sponsors, or when non-conventional
- chemical, biological, and nuclear - weapons enter the terror arsenal
and endanger the entire international community, will countries in the
free world initiate an uncompromising struggle against international terrorism
and its sponsors.

<P>Indeed, effective counterterrorism policies and efforts against terrorism
sponsors require limitations on the ability of individual states to make
independent decisions. In this case, the authority to define states and
organizations as terrorism sponsors and to act accordingly in response
should be given to a permanent international institution made of experts
from a number of different countries. This international council will study
state involvement in terrorism and, on the basis of its findings, will
publish a yearly list of countries which engage in terrorism (experts will
operate according to an internationally approved mandate). International
measures will be adopted against countries included in this list, according
to their level of involvement in terrorism, so as to force them to stop
or limit their involvement.

<P>This is an extremely difficult task, in fact almost impossible. It requires,
<I>inter alia,</I> broad international consensus regarding the definition
of terrorism and the delineation of the various levels of sponsorship.
Indeed, such a concerted international move in this area may be doomed
to fail. However, it is possible that the international community could
implement some of these goals by establishing a "League of Nations Fighting
Terrorism." A group which would include a small number of countries, possibly
to be enlarged at a later stage.

<P>The United Nations should fulfill this role, but past experience shows
that this organization cannot be expected to lead an effective move against
international terrorism in general, and certainly not against specific
terrorism sponsors. It is worth mentioning in this context the statement
by the former Israeli president Mr. Chaim Herzog (who was also Israel’s
ambassador to the United Nations):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>It is utterly unrealistic to expect any positive development
to emerge from the UN on the subject of terrorism, as indeed on many other
subjects. The only hope is for the free countries led by the U.S. to bind
themselves in a convention outside the UN against terror which provides
for international sanctions, a convention by which they will be bound.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The late Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, also addressed this issue:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The response to international terrorism must also be international.
Nations must find ways of cooperating against the terrorist network. .
. I propose that this type of cooperation be institutionalized and made
concrete. Countries that choose to coordinate their activities against
international terrorism should create a special international organization
for this purpose. Obviously, this organization cannot be created within
the framework of the United Nations. It can come into being only if the
United States, the most powerful country in the free world, will take the
initiative and call for its establishment . . . This organization should
coordinate four main functions: first, intelligence gathering and counterintelligence;
second, protection of facilities and transportation routes . . . Third,
military operations in cases of emergency . . . Fourth, and most difficult,
political action against states that initiate and promote terror. Countries
that initiate terrorism must be made to understand that they will face
an organized, united front of states, a union ready to take measures that
an attacked country would not be able to undertake alone. The existence
of such an agency might help serve as a deterrent, and possibly an effective
means of sanctions and punishment.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
