<BR>The following is an excerpt from a notice by Al-Muhajiroun (The International
Islamic Front) vowing to continue the struggle "against the Enemy of Islam."&nbsp;
The document was published in MSANews under the heading <A HREF="http://msanews.mynet.net/MSANEWS/199808/19980809.15.html">USA
YOU MUST PAY</A>.&nbsp;

<P>"We, Al-Muhajiroun as much as we regret the innocent deaths among the
civilians who are nothing to do with the US embassies, declare that we
endorse and applaud today's bombing of US embassies in Dar-as-Salaam, Tanzania
and Nairobi, Kenya. This is because they are the embassies of the enemy
of Islam and the Muslims, and the occupiers of Muslim Land e.g. Saudi Arabia.
The Bombs were explosions of pain and grief of the masses that live under
the domination of the colonialist oligarchic Americans. Al-Muhajiroun salutes
the message that has been sent - American interests are not
safe anywhere in the world. The Mujahideen will seek out and obliterate
them into rubble as happened today. Let the cowards in the USA army know
that they will not always slaughter women and children and go unaccounted."&nbsp;

in East Africa by saying, "America has placed itself by the side of Israel
against the Arab world,...I consider what happened self defense by someone
who was seeking revenge for the injustice of American policy and the destruction
it has brought on their country."&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>The Taliban on Saturday, one day after the bombings, insisted that
Osama bin Ladin had nothing to do with the two attacks.&nbsp; The exiled
Saudi millionaire is viewed by many as the prime suspect in orchestrating
the bombings.&nbsp; Security analysts claim that he has both the capability
and the motivation to have arranged the highly sophisticated attacks.&nbsp;
However, the Taliban claims that bin Ladin "does not have the capability
or permission to conduct such deeds.&nbsp; Any suggestion to the contrary
is false propaganda of the enemies of Osama and Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan".&nbsp;
The Taliban spokesman went on to say that "Osama is a guest of the Islamic
Emirate. We cannot extradite him to anybody." He revealed that the Taliban
had recently signed an intelligence agreement with the Saudi intelligence,
and that the Taliban had promised the Saudis that bin Ladin would not be
allowed to carry out subversive activities against them from Taliban-controlled
territory.&nbsp; However, he added, no such assurances&nbsp; had been given
the Americans.&nbsp;

<TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><B>Iran</B>&nbsp;
<BR>The Official Iranian News Agency IRNA published a statement on August
8 condemning the bombings.&nbsp; "The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns
the bomb explosions at U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania," said Foreign ministry Spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi. The statement
added that "the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns any acts which may result
in the death of innocent people," and that Mohammadi hoped that "through
international cooperation and an all-out campaign against terrorism the
sinister phenomena of terrorism will be uprooted."&nbsp;

<P>Iran, ironically, immediately took up the cudgels against bin Ladin
by attempting to blame Bin Ladin as being responsible for the Dhahran bombing
and the Taliban government as the sponsor of the attacks in Africa. It
should be remembered that the Taliban recently took hostage 11 Iranian
diplomats, and that Iran has been considered as a potential culprit in
the Dhahran bombing. The following quotation appeared in the official Iranian
News Agency, which based itself on "foreign sources": "Usama bin-Ladin,
the real criminal of the recent explosion of American embassies in Kenya
and tanzania is Taleban's main financial supporter of terrorist training."
Bin Ladin, according to the source quoted by IRNA was also accused of "planning
a bomb explosion on the American base in Dhahran (Saudi Arabia). . ." The
source added that bin Ladin "was also responsible for terrorist activities
and financial supporter (sic) against the Algerian Government and some
of the para military group in Saudi Arabia".&nbsp;

<TD><B>The Sudanese Ummah Party</B>&nbsp;
<BR>The Sudanese opposition Ummah Party denounced the US embassy bombings.&nbsp;
The Sudanese opposition was quoted as saying that the two "regrettable
incidents" showed that the "international network" of violence and extremism
is "still active in implementing their global agenda, benefiting from the
facilities and services offered by some regional states and groups."&nbsp;
The Ummah Party hinted that the Sudanese Government could have been involved
in the attacks, "given that since the 1990s the Sudanese regime has offered
itself as a gateway for the Islamic movements to Africa and a springboard
for the African continent under the guise of Islamic call and aid."&nbsp;
The Ummah pointed out that there were factors "pointing to the Sudanese
regime's hidden role and the possibility of its involvement" in the terrorist
attacks.&nbsp; Such factors included&nbsp; Sudan's connections to "terrorist
networks, it propagation of violent and extremist thought, and the presence
of fundamentalist security centers within the regime."&nbsp;

<TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><B>The Moslem Brotherhood in Cairo</B>&nbsp;
<BR>The Moslem Brotherhood group in Cairo condemned the bombings, saying
that "they do not accept haphazard assassinations like what took place
in the two embassies."&nbsp; They claimed that every such attack was used
as an excuse to "lay blame on Arab nationals, ethnic or Islamic groups before
any evidence is established,"&nbsp; such as happened in the case of the
Oklahoma City bombing. ArabicNews.com quoted an official Moslem Brotherhood
source as saying, "It is too bad that each time an aggression takes place
no one is accused but the Islamic organizations."&nbsp;
