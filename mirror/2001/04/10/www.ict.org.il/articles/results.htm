<P><B>Boaz Ganor, ICT Director</B>

<P>One of the questions arising from the American strikes is, what will
be the consequences?&nbsp; Will they achieve their
goal of preventing further terrorist attacks against American interests?&nbsp;
Or will the present attacks result in a "boomerang effect" -- an escalation
involving more and more deadly terrorist attacks against the United States?&nbsp;
Every nation facing terrorism knows that it must act offensively to prevent
terrorists from perpetrating attacks freely whenever and wherever they
choose.&nbsp; However the nation that decides to attack terrorists must
take into consideration the possibility that such action may increase the
terrorists' motivation to take revenge for the damage to their capabilities
and to their "image."

<P>A terrorist attack is a function of two factors -- the motivation of
the terrorists to carry out attacks, and their capability to do so.&nbsp;
Offensive action against terrorist organizations, by its very nature, increases
their motivation to execute revenge attacks.&nbsp; However, at the worst
such strikes won't increase their ability to carry out more attacks; and
at best, will greatly damage their capabilities to do so.

<P>The question now is, have the American strikes done enough damage to
the infrastructure and operational capacities of bin Ladin's network, as
to preclude, at least for the short term, the possibility of revenge?&nbsp;
Or will bin Ladin be able to continue operating as before?&nbsp; Looked
at this way, it would seem that bin Ladin and the organizations allied
with him, not to mention his many followers around the world, still have
the ability to execute terrorist attacks.&nbsp; But now their motivation
to carry out such attacks will be greater than ever, as they will feel
they must avenge themselves and restore their image.

<P>The U.S. can attempt to forestall this escalation of terrorism by conveying
the message clearly that it has both the capability and the operational
intelligence to strike a far heavier blow against its attackers, and that
the present offensive in Afghanistan and Sudan is merely the "tip of the
iceberg" of American capabilities.&nbsp; However, this is not enough.&nbsp;
The terrorist organizations involved here do not operate in a vacuum.&nbsp;
They enjoy the support and refuge of nations.&nbsp; The United States must
also make it clear to these nations that if they support and nurture terrorist
groups such as bin Ladin and his followers, they will be held responsible
for the actions of those terrorists if they don't prevent further attacks and
disarm the perpetrators.

<P>The American forcefulness in combating terrorism cannot stand alone.
It is incumbent upon other enlightened nations to stand by the United States,
and to declare to terrorist organizations and their adherents that they
can expect neither support nor sympathy from the rest of the world.
