<p>The Lockerbie trial about to be resumed in the Netherlands will soon
enter one of its most important stages. In the coming sessions a critical
witness, a Libyan double agent, will take the stand. The testimony of this
defector is expected to confirm not just the complicity of the suspects
but also the use of Libyan Airline facilities in Malta for intelligence
purposes. Indeed, this may prove to be the most important piece of evidence
proffered by the prosecution in their long struggle to see that the Libyan
suspects are convicted.
<p>Seen as one of the most significant criminal proceedings in the history
of Scottish jurisprudence, the Lockerbie trial, which began on May 3, took
a remarkable turn during the past month. Among the characters that surfaced
were a series of unsavory European businessmen, former East German intelligence
agencies, and an alleged Iranian defector. But despite the high drama that
is permeating the proceedings, the prosecution is quietly defying its detractors
by meticulously constructing a plausible case for the conviction of the
two suspects.
<p><b>Libya Linked to the Evidence</b>
<p>During the past month, the prosecution has concentrated its efforts
on linking the two suspects to the detonating device manufactured by the
Swiss firm MEBO and discovered in the aircraft wreckage. Taking the stand,
Edward Bollier, the owner of MEBO, offered riveting testimony on his dealings
with the suspects and with Libyan intelligence agencies. In the course
of his testimony, Bollier acknowledged delivering twenty timers with MST
circuit boards to the headquarters of the Libyan secret service and confessed
that his company constructed briefcases with the necessary mechanisms to
detonate bombs from remote locations. Bollier even advised his Libyan contractors
on how to assemble the bombs and witnessed a test run of the timers at
a training installation in Libya'a Sabha Desert. During this test, a bomb
was detonated on an airborne aircraft, Bollier informed a stunned courtroom
during his five days on the stand. Bollier defended his conduct by suggesting
that Libyan intelligence officials assured him that the timers would be
used for destroying Libyan camps and equipment in Chad; Bollier acknowledged
that while in Tripoli he met Libyan defendant Abel Basset al-Megrahi, who
seemingly acted in an official military capacity. The timing, however,
seems to negate such a rationalization as Libya had essentially disengaged
from Chad in 1986, the year of the bombing, while its purchase of the timers
continued beyond that date. In the end, the Swiss businessman's testimony
not only directly implicated the suspects but also demonstrated the extent
to which Libyan preparations resembled the actual explosion.
<p>The prosecution's case has long been based on the belief that the suspects
placed a Samsonite suitcase containing the bomb on a plane in Malta, and
the court has now been presented with conclusive evidence placing one of
the suspects in Malta before the explosion. The prosecution unveiled passports,
hotel registration cards, and a telephone call invoice confirming that
al-Megrahi was in Malta on December 20 and 21 (the bombing took place on
the 21st), evidence that further buttresses the connection between Lockerbie
and Libya. In addition, computer records at the Frankfurt airport confirm
that the suitcase originated in Malta; the challenge remains to link the
suspects to the suitcase. In pursuit of this task, the prosecution is expected
to offer eyewitness accounts placing al-Megrahi at Malta's airport purchasing
the suitcase.
<p>In its rebuttal, the defense team has concentrated on exposing Bollier's
exceptionally defective character, and they have also maintained that radical
Palestinian groups, aided by the Stasi (the former East German secret police)
and acting on behalf of Iran, actually carried out the bombing. Richard
Keen, lawyer for one of the suspects, showed that MEBO supplied approximately
fifteen timers to East Germany in 1985 and several more at later dates.
"You concealed from the authorities that MEBO had supplied MST timers to
the Statsi," defense counsel David Burns pointedly suggested. "That is
why you accused Libya, to deflect attention from the PLFP-GC [Popular Liberation
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command]?" The defense failed,
however, to counter MEBO co-owner Edward Meister's claim that some of the
timers sold to East Germany were different than the ones dispatched to
Libya. Moreover, the defense team has thus far failed to prove that the
Stasi transferred such sensitive equipment to the Palestinian groups. Paradoxically,
the attempt by the defense to tie the Swiss firm to the East German security
services seems to have actually validated an aspect of the prosecution's
case, confirming that MEBO displayed limited scruples in its client selection.
<p>As to the presence of al-Megrahi in Malta on December 20 and 21, the
defense has claimed that many Libyans find Malta a perfect vacation spot.
In cross-examining the hotel workers, the defense did elicit the acknowledgment
that many Libyans stay at Maltese hotels throughout the year. Still, al-Megrahi's
vacation habits seem rather peculiar as he stayed overnight, using a false
name and forged travel documents.
<p>The intrigue of the trial was temporarily heightened by the appearance
of an alleged Iranian defector, Ahmed Behbahani, who declared that the
bombing was a joint operation by Iran and Libya. Behbahani claimed to have
directed all of Iran's terrorism operations abroad and to have personally
assembled the group responsible for carrying out the Pan Am bombing. The
fact that Iran had pledged retaliation for the shooting down of Iranian
airliners in 1988 by the United States, and that Libya similarly promised
revenge for the 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli, gave credence to Behbahani's
claim of collusion between the two powers. Once the alleged defector's
tales were scrutinized, however, they were effectively undermined. The
Central Intelligence Agency immediately challenged Behbahani's story, pointing
to his lack of familiarity with Iran's intelligence structure. Although
it is possible that Behbahani may at some point have been associated with
Iran's vast intelligence apparatus, the contradictions and exaggerations
of his account render his attempt to implicate Tehran in the Lockerbie
bombing spurious.
<p><b>What Next?</b>
<p>Despite the sensational events of the past month, the Lockerbie trial
is likely to generate even more headlines in the coming weeks. The prosecution
is expected to introduce its star witness, Abdul Jiacha, a Libyan double
agent who worked undercover as an assistant manager for Libyan Arab Airlines
in Malta. Jiacha was smuggled out of Malta by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and defected to the United States in 1991. He is not only familiar with
the two suspects but is expected to testify about how Libya used the airline's
installations in Malta for intelligence purposes and for the storage of
explosives. For a trial that has already witnessed its share of intrigue
and conspiracy theories, the drama will only intensify when Jiacha takes
the stand.
