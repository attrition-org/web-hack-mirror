<P>
Khomeini bequeathed to his successors the support for the armed struggle
of the “Fighting Muslims”. Since his death Iran has expanded and improved
the terror option. Although the claim is heard frequently in the West,
that only the Iranian radicals support terrorism, the reality has proved
otherwise. The radicals in recent years have been ousted from the centers
of power, whereas both the Iranian spiritual leader, Khamena’i, and President
Rafsanjani were in all probability, directly involved in ordering the execution
of terrorist attacks. Moreover, there are several Iranian agencies involved
(directly or indirectly) in terrorism abroad: the Ministry of Intelligence,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Guardians of the Revolution. Various
other Iranian organizations, cultural centers and mosques serve as an infrastructure
for the recruitment of local militants and as a cover for terrorist activity.

<P>In spite of its undercover nature, Iran’s worldwide involvement in international
terrorism cannot always be concealed. Occasionally, events come to light
that are proof of Iranian government's involvement in terrorist activities.
For instance, the March 1996 discovery, in Belgium, of a specially-built
Howitzer canon sent by ship from Iran to Germany to be used in a terrorist
attack; or the involvement of the highest Iranian officials in the assassination
of Kurdish leaders in Germany, the so-called “Mikonos Affair”.

<P>The Islamic regime’s determination to continue supporting terrorism,
in conflict with normal international behavior, has forced the Iranian
Foreign Ministry to strive, under extreme international pressure, to offset
the damage caused by this policy to Tehran’s economic and political ties.
Iran does not deny its adherence to Khomeini’s "Islamic revolutionary ideology”,
which supports all radical Islamic movements worldwide, but stresses that
Iranian assistance is merely cultural, moral and humanitarian in nature.
Tehran strongly denies any military and/or financial assistance to these
movements. It must be emphasized that such denial is deeply imbedded in
the Shi’ite tradition, in the principle of the “taqiyya” (concealing the
faith) which was used as a means of protection against the persecutors
of the Shi’ite religion.

<P>
<HR align="center" size="1" width="80%">

<P><A NAME="israel"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Iranian
Terror Against Israel</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Since the “Madrid Conference” in October 1991, Iran has been active
in attempting to disrupt the peace process in the Middle East, which threatens
to increase Iran's political isolation in the region, to limit its influence
and interests in Lebanon. This opposition lead Iran to strengthen its ties
with those Palestinian organizations that oppose the peace process, such
as The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hamas and the various “Fronts”.
Iran hoped that terrorist attacks carried out by the Palestinian organizations,
together with those perpetrated by Hizballah, would hamper the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations and undermine Yasser Arafat’s position. This goal concurs
with the basic Iranian hostility towards Israel that originates from the
regime’s Islamic religious ideology. Iran refuses to recognize Israel’s
existence, and refers to Israel as “the occupation regime of al Quds”,
and constantly calls for the destruction of Israel.

<P>Iran does not conceal its ties with the Palestinian organizations that
oppose the political process, Hamas, the PIJ and Ahmad Jibril’s PFLP-GC.
Furthermore, these organizations make public their connections and cooperation
with Iran. Most of the Palestinian organizations that oppose the peace
process participated in the “Conferences for the Support of the Uprising”
organized by Tehran (4-6 December 1990; 19-22 October 1991).

<P>During these highly publicized conferences, the leaders of the Palestinian
organizations met with the top political echelons in Iran. A special committee
headed by the Iranian Vice President in charge of Parliamentary and Legal
Affairs, Attalla Maharjani was formed as a result of Tehran's decision
to provide the “Palestinian uprising” with financial, military, political
and humanitarian. An Iranian “Fund for the Martyrs” gives financial and
humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians, in support of the “Jihad”.
Within the framework of Iran’s efforts to instill its hostility towards
Israel into the rest of the Muslim world, Khomeini declared the last Friday
of the month of Ramadan as “al-Quds Day”, to mark the Muslims’ aspirations
to liberate Jerusalem.

<P>In February 1996 at a meeting in Damascus with the leaders of the ten
Palestinian opposition organizations, Iran’s Vice President, Habibi stressed
the need to coordinate the struggle against Israel. Iran also justified
the terrorist suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon (25 February 1996)
and described them as the answer to Israel’s “inhumane” policy towards
the Palestinians.

<P>
<HR align="center" size="1" width="80%">

Assistance To Palestinian Terror Organizations</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">The Palestinian Islamic Jihad</FONT></B>

<P>The Palestinian organization most loyal to the Iranian revolutionary
ideology is the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In spite of it being a Sunni
organization, the Iranian revolution sees in it an example to be followed.
After the deportation of its leader, Fathi Shqaqi, from the Gaza Strip,
the ties between Iran and the organization have been strengthened, particularly
in the field of Iranian military assistance. Instructors of the Guardians
of the Revolution give regular military instruction courses to the organization's
activists from the Territories and abroad, as well as in the Hizballah
camps in Lebanon and Iran. Iran also provides the organization’s activists
with logistic support, including Iranian identitificatio papers.

<P>As an example, a militant by the name of Khaled Zaqarna of Jenin, was
given extensive military training in January 1995 at the Hizballah camp
in the Baka’a Valley, as well as at the Guardians of the Revolution’s camp
in Ba'albek, Lebanon. There he underwent advanced training in light weapons,
the handling of mines and Lau anti-tank rockets. He was then infiltrated
into the Territories to establish an extensive network in support of suicide
bombings.

<P>Iran also aided The PIJ in laying the groundwork for terrorist attacks
abroad. At the beginning of 1996, the organization’s representative in
Iran visited Turkey to prepare for the training in Iran of several of the
organization’s activists. These activists were due to infiltrate back into
Israel in order to carry out terrorist attacks. The Turkish security authorities
arrested some of the PIJ militants and one of them, Khalil 'Atta, was arrested
in Israel. 'Atta was one of nine PIJ militants who underwent training in
Iran in the period of July - September 1995.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">The Hamas</FONT></B>

<P>Since 1992, Iran has drawn closer to Hamas, which it perceives as the
leading Islamic movement in the Territories. At the foundation of their
relationship lies their common interest in the disruption of the political
process, and their efforts to undermine the PLO. These common goals transcend
the ideological variance between them due to religious differences between
the Sunni Hamas and the Shi’ite Iran. These ties are manifest themselves
in frequent high-level meetings between the two sides, and the relative
importance of the Hamas representative in Tehran. For example, a Hamas
delegation headed by two top activists, 'Imad 'Alami (Chairman of the Internal
Committee) and Mustafa Qanu' (the representative in Syria) visited Iran
in October 1995 and met with high ranking Iranian officials.

<P>In addition to political ties, Iran also provides Hamas with military
assistance. The movement’s activists train on a regular basis at the camps
of Hizballah and the Guardians of the Revolution in Lebanon, as well as
in Iran. This includes training for suicide attacks. Several Iranian-trained
militants succeeded in infiltrating back into the Territories under Palestinian
Authority control. Israel has arrested Hamas activists who admitted that
they were trained by Iranian instructors in the Beka’a Valley, in Lebanon,
and in Iran. The training included the use of light weapons, photography
and sabotage.

<P>Iran also gives Hamas financial assistance. In 1992, several million
dollars were transferred to Hamas’ account, including money originating
from the Iranian “Fund for the Martyrs”, which grants assistance to victims
of the “Palestinian Uprising”.

<P>
<HR align="center" size="1" width="80%">

<P><A NAME="hizballa"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Assistance
to Hizballah</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The Hizballah organization is the spearhead for Iran in its use of terrorism
in general, and in its fight against Israel in particular. The organization
began its large-scale terror acts in 1982, when its militants blew up the
American Embassy in Beirut, killing 61 people and wounding more than 120.
Later, it was behind a series of terror attacks against Western targets,
among them: the suicide bombing of the Marines Headquarters in Beirut (23
October 1983) and the French Military Headquarters in Beirut, in which
241 Americans and 56 French soldiers were killed. In the 1980s, Hizballah
activists were involved in the kidnapping of Western citizens in Lebanon
whom they held as hostages. In some cases, this was done on Iranian orders,
for the purpose of obtaining economic or political concessions from Western
governments, such as the release of Iranian or Lebanese terrorists imprisoned
in Western Europe.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">Financial Assistance</FONT></B>

<P>Iran provides financial assistance on a large scale to Hizballah, reaching,
according to some estimates, millions of dollars a year. It also gives
tactical assistance in terror attacks against Israel, through the Guardians
of the Revolution units posted in the Baka’a Valley. The Hizballah General
Secretary, Hassan Nasrallah, made public Iranian support in an interview
given to al-Wast (11 March 1996), where he stated that his organization
receives financial and political assistance to continue, in his words,
"the legitimate struggle against Israel".

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">Weapons and Ammunition</FONT></B>

<P>Iran has been Hizballah's main weapons supplier since its establishment.
Iranian assistance includes a wide range of weapons and ammunition, such
as mortars, Sagger anti-tank rockets, mines, explosives and small arms.
As far as is known, the largest arms consignment sent by Iran to Lebanon
was in February/March 1992 in the wake of the incidents between Israel
and the Hizballah. Since then, there have been no significant arms consignments
dispatched by air, probably due to Syrian objection. However, six trucks
carrying arms from Iran to Lebanon, were apprehended in Turkey in mid-
January 1996. Thus it can be assumed that Iran is now making extensive
use of the land route to transfer arms to Hizballah.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Training</FONT></B>

<P>Iranian assistance to Hizballah in this field is mostly advice and supervision
of the Hizballah's training program, since the basic instruction is carried
out by the organization’s militants themselves. The Guardians of the Revolution
(more explicitly the training arm of the al-Quds Forces) provides higher
level training in Iran mainly at the al-Quds Force training base “Imam
Ali” in northern Tehran). These include courses for officers, company commanders,
commandos, and courses in communications and powered-gliders.

<P><A NAME="activists"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Elimination
Of Opposition Activists</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Since the Islamic regime came to power in 1979, it has consistently
acted to eliminate Iranian opposition activists outside the country and
has invested considerable intelligence efforts in surveillance and tracking-down
of anyone conceived as a threat to the regime. Examples of this activity
became glaringly obvious in the wake of the following trials in which Iran
was implicated:
<UL>
<LI>
The liquidation of Iran's former Prime Minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar, the
leader of one of the main Iranian opposition groups (6 Aug. 91) in France.
The investigation of this incident led to the arrest of three Iranians
(including a diplomat), who probably belonged to the Iranian Intelligence
Ministry. The trial exposed the involvement of various Iranian agencies
(the Ministry of Communication, Diplomatic representatives, commercial
companies, “Iran Air”) - all of which assisted in the liquidation. One
of the accused was sentenced to life imprisonment, another was given a
10-year prison sentence, and the diplomat was acquitted owing to lack of
evidence and returned to Iran.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The liquidation of high ranking activists belonging to the Iranian Democratic
Kurdish Party (17 Sept. 92) at the Mikonos restaurant in Berlin. This operation
was carried out by a squad composed of Hizballah and Iranian intelligence
operatives, headed by a member of the Islamic Students Association in Germany
Khatem Dara'abi, who apparently was employed by the Iranian Intelligence
Ministry as the liaison between the Iranian Consulate in Berlin and the
hit team. Dara'abi and four other Shi’ite activists were arrested by the
German police. German security officials stressed the involvement of Iranian
Intelligence and the Guards of the Islamic Revolution in the affair.</LI>
</UL>
The German Federal Prosecution issued a warrant for the arrest of the Minister
of Iranian Intelligence, Falakhian, who is accused of ordering the liquidation
of the opposition members.

<P>Since Rasfanjani's rise to power in 1989, scores of Iranian opposition
members have been liquidated worldwide, among them:
<UL>
<LI>
Abdol Rahman Qassemlo, General Secretary of the Kurdish Democratic Party
of Iran (13 July 89);</LI>

<LI>
Kazen Rahavi (in Switzerland, 24 April 90);</LI>

<LI>
Muhammad Hussein Naghdi, the representative of the National Opposition
Council in Italy (the umbrella organization of the Iranian regime’s Opposition)
(16 March 93).</LI>
</UL>
In 1996 the Iranian regime continued to act against the opposition worldwide,
particularly against their main centers in Iraq and Turkey. One example
is the assassination (on 20 February, 96) in Istanbul of two activists
from Mujahedin-e Khalq by Iranian intelligence agents and the assassination
of another Mujahedin-e Khalq activist in Baghdad (7 March 96). There has
been a rise in the volume of Iranian efforts to increase intelligence capabilities
in the Kurdish district in Iraq, in order to direct subversive activity,
inter alia, against opposition targets there [<A HREF="#links">Links to
Further Info</A>].

<P>As a rule, Iran, in an effort to improve its relations with the West
and to appear in a more positive light, refrains from carrying out terror
attacks in Western Europe. However, should an occasion present itself,
Iran does not hesitate to rise to the occasion - mostly through deniable
emissaries, to prevent the attacks being traced directly to their source.
For proof one need look no farther than the specially built Howitzer mortar
intercepted on an Iranian vessel on its way from Iran to Antwerp port (14
March ’96). This mortar, addressed to a shop with Iranian intelligence
connections in Germany, and ready for activation, was probably intended
for a future terror attack against Iranian opposition members or Israeli/Jewish
targets in Europe.

<P>
<HR align="center" size="1" width="80%">

<P><A NAME="rushdie"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Rushdie
Affair</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Within the framework of Iranian terror, it is worth mentioning the obsessive
and unrelenting pursuit and incitement campaign which Iran is conducting
against the writer Salman Rushdie (author of “The Satanic Verses”), whom
they perceive to be the symbol of the degradation of Islamic values.&nbsp;
Khomeini’s "fatwa" or&nbsp; religious ruling (February 89) permits the
shedding of his blood and calls for his liquidation, and also of anyone
who knowingly helped to publish his novel. The Iranians are continuing
to persecute Rushdie in spite of the strong criticism voiced by the West
against them, which continues to overshadow the improvement in relations
between the West and Iran. The Iranians have placed a large reward on Rushdie’s
head and their intelligence apparatus has spared no efforts in trying to
locate him, as well as trying to prevent the distribution of his book by
eliminating publishers and translators. On 11 July 93, the Japanese scholar,
Hitushi Igarashi, who translated the book into Japanese, was murdered.
And in Norway William Nygaard, the local publisher of “The Satanic Verses”,
was badly injured in an assassination attempt (11 Oct.93). In spite of
Iranian pragmatic officials’ efforts to find a solution to the “Rushdie
Affair” by giving him a written commitment that he would not be harmed,
the religious establishment insists on adhering to Khomeini's ruling and
refuses any compromise.

<P>Ayatollah Hassan Sanei offered $2 million for Salman Rushdie's head,
and extended the threat of murder to include all supporters of Rushdie,
meaning the rushdie support committees in the West.&nbsp; These groups
became increasingly vocal around the February 14 anniversary of the fatwah.
One of the latest authoritative pronouncements on the Rushdie affair was
that of Mohammad Yazdi, the head of Iran's judiciary, who said (April 1996),
"[the fatwah] will finally be carried out someday".&nbsp; Two days later,
the Majlis speaker, Ali Akbar Nouri, reaffirmed his support for the fatwa,
saying that he "regretted that Rushdie is still alive".

<BR><A NAME="western"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Terror against
Western Targets</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>During the 1980s, Iranian and pro-Iranian agencies were involved in
the planning and execution of attacks against Western targets, particularly
in Lebanon. In the context of opposition to Western Influence, the Islamic
Jihad and Hizballah, under instructions from Iran, carried out a series
of attacks against Western representatives. Among them:
<UL>
<LI>
The suicide bombing of the American embassy in Beirut (18 April. 83), which
killed 61 people and left more than 120 wounded.</LI>

<LI>
The suicide bombing of the Marines headquarters in Beirut (23 Oct.83),
which killed 39 and wounded 40 people.</LI>

<LI>
The suicide bombing of the French army barracks in Beirut (23 Oct. 83),
which killed 74 and wounded about 15.</LI>
</UL>
During the latter half of the 1980s, the Iranians directed the handling
of the Western hostages, including the negotiations for their release,
via special emissaries. These emissaries acted as mediators between the
various Lebanese groups holding the hostages (such as Ahmad Mughniyya)
and the Iranian government, which conducted the negotiations. Iranian bartered
the release of citizens of Western countries being held in Lebanon in return
for the release of Iranian or Lebanese activists arrested for involvement
in terrorist activity in Western Europe. Since the release of the last
Western hostage (mid 92), Iran and its emissaries have avoided carrying
out terror attacks on Western targets. It is also possible that Iran was
behind the attempt to disrupt the “Madrid Conference” on the peace process
between Israel and its Arab neighbors (Oct. 91) by executing several terror
attacks during the Conference against the citizens and interests of the
countries taking part in the Conference. Among these:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>28 October, 91</B>&nbsp; An explosive device blew up the car of an American
sergeant in Turkey. The Turkish Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for
the attack.</LI>

<LI>
<B>29 October,&nbsp; 91</B>&nbsp; A rocket was fired at the American Embassy
in Beirut and caused slight damage. A front organization calling itself
"The Revolutionary Arab Forces" claimed responsibility for the attack in
protest against the Peace Process.</LI>

<LI>
<B>30 October, 91</B>&nbsp; A rocket was fired at the Spanish Consulate
in Zidon. There were no casualties.</LI>
