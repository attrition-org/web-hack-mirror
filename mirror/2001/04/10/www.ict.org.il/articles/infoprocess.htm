<p><b>Eric Herren,</b>
<br><b>ICT consultant</b>
<p><b>Preface</b>
<br>In the world of cyberspace, information has become one of our most
vital interests. Information is available in all possible varieties of
quantity and quality. We are living in the “age of information.”
<p>In general we can say that information has something to do with sending
and receiving signals. This article will focus on the process of receiving
signals in connection with the “time” factor—in other words the need to
process information quickly and react appropriately.
<p>If time is not something that one has to worry about, incoming signals
can be easily identified, selected and forwarded to further processing.
Without the pressure of time the focus on information can be wide open,
and information that cannot be processed immediately will be collected
and analyzed according to ones capacity.
<p>In terms of classical military and political intelligence, the interrelationship
between time and information processing is well known and is put into practice
in every possible phase.
<p>In connection with counter terrorism, time becomes one of the primary
issues. The lives of people depend on the real-time processing and the
use to which one puts the available information on all levels of operation.
Decisions are made and actions are initiated only after the successful
processing of information—from the analyst in the office to the assault
team on the front line.
<p>During a counter-terrorist operation, time management becomes more and
more important the closer the assault force comes to the terrorist. The
conception of the next step becomes identical with the next step itself.
The “time” factor is almost zero.
<p><b>Thinking: arranging actions!</b>
<br><i>“Thinking proceeds from doing. Thinking begins</i>
<br><i>when the foundation for doing is put at risk or has to be corrected!”</i>
<p>A human being is constantly using his or her resources to unconsciously
attain a goal. The mechanisms of behavior are often totally involuntary.
In our daily life we can make the distinction between what we are doing
and what we are thinking. We travel to work without needing to give any
thought to how to climb the stairs; we just do it, perhaps thinking all
the while about the upcoming meeting.
<p>Thinking starts when the stairs are covered with obstacles; it starts
with attentiveness, the consciousness of acting. Now suddenly new information
can influence our behavior.
<p><b>Training of Counter-Terrorist Units</b>
<br>Professional training covers the range of technical and tactical aspects
of a situation. Many different techniques are employed in training the
physical component of the soldier. Most of the “combat actions” become
automatic movements. Such “automatization” only makes sense where it can
be integrated into a higher task in the context of an active process.
<p>Purposeful behavior means to splitting up a complex action into different
fractional actions. Many of these fractional actions are so called automatisms.
<p>Automatisms are situated somewhere between intentional actions and simple
reflexes. The consciousness controls the automatisms “remotely” and inserts
them if necessary into more complicated interrelations.
<p>In the course of regular training, fighters simulate all kinds of situations
and scenarios. A lot of training is done in a “closed circle.” The locations
are well known and one approaches the facility with the consciousness of
being in a “training area.” Every scenario creates a new pattern of inter-linked
fractional actions.
<p><b>Reality</b>
<br>Usually the “real incident” includes the element of surprise—something
new and unforeseen. The fighter is forced to curtail existing automatic
actions and react according to the “new” information. He must create a
new pattern of acting, depending on his skill and other abilities.
<p>The outcome of the new situation is dependent mainly on the correct
assessment of the latest information. A positive assessment will lead to
a positive psychological reaction. Doubts or negative assessments will
create fear and lead to a negative psychological reaction. Simulations
demonstrate that in the stress-fear relation the important factor is not
so much the degree of stress, but the reactions to it.
<p>One of the most important capabilities with regard to a positive assessment
is the ability to process information. One has to be able to detect the
new information as such, as soon as possible. Attentiveness even during
an extended period of time is part of this skill. Perception abilities
ease the process. The incoming information has to be selected according
to specific criteria. The new information can lead either to analytic or
reactive behavior.
<p>The significance of the reactive behavior is the focus. Thinking and
doing become one. In extreme situations one cannot allow ones concentration
to drift away to “what will happen?” If the time factor is close to zero,
every additional thought is an obstacle to the best possible reaction.
For a good reaction it is important to focus on the moment. Most panic
reactions take place when one looses the moment and attempts to force an
outcome. If one can stay “within the moment” there is usually sufficient
room for a proper reaction.
<p>The nervous system is not capable of continuous processing of incoming
sensory information; the vast majority will simply be filtered out! The
role of nervous system is to identify which incoming signals require processing.
The capacity for concentration is the leading factor in receiving information.
Once our saturation point is reached with regard to concentration, nothing
more will be received.
<p>The role of the brain is the identification of the incoming stimulation
and the actual decision making process—a process that depends on the fighter’s
abilities—which will lead to a particular physical action.
<p>For successful information processing, every forwarded stimulus needs
a referent. The input has to be connected to stored datum that supports
the decision and finally results in a particular action.
<p><b>Combined Training</b>
<br>Without going too deeply into psychological and physiological details,
we can highlight the following needs with regard to new forms of training
for highly professional units.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Knowledge (taught)</i></li>

<br>In order to accommodate forwarded information all types of referents
must be created. These referents take the form of knowledge. All possible
information related to the task at hand must be available in order to support
the decision making process. To create this kind of knowledge we should
use the interdisciplinary method—thus gaining the advantages all possible
aspects of a given situation.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Ability (trained)</i></li>

<br>The need of different abilities is not limited only on physical or
technical skills. If we focus on Information processing we need as well
abilities in:</ul>

<ol>
<ul>
<li>
concentration</li>

<li>
perception</li>

<li>
attentiveness</li>

<li>
selective reception-capability</li>

<li>
and many more</li>
</ul>
</ol>
To initiate a quick and appropriate reaction to incoming information we
need, most of all, the mental capability to impart the whole process—from
the formation of the information, through its detection, up until the initiation
of the response. One must be familiar with all the techniques used in mental
training to create likely scenarios. The strong visualization of a scenario
creates a situation for the brain as if it already happened. Positive patterns
of action can be programmed into the central nervous system. Thus, familiar
“real” input takes place in the brain the same way. The mental “idea” of
solving the problem serves as a guideline for the actual action.
<p>The use of automatic movements proceeds from the directions given by
the stored “footprints” of the mental training. From this point of view
even the best fighting skills will not help if they are not activated at
the right moment of the confrontation.
<p><b>Summary</b>
<br>In order for the soldier to cope with all kinds of scenarios, and react
with a positive assessment of the situation, new training methods must
include mental and intellectual abilities and skills.
<p>Modern technology helps us to detect and “receive” more and more information.
To filter this information in light of the aims of the operation—needs
of the moment—and to further process it in order to arrive at the correct
decision in the fastest possible way; this is still up to the human being.
<p>Our task is to create adequate mental “footprints” to keep the behavior
of the soldier aligned on the target while still as flexible as possible.
If reality is identical with the unfolding of the action in training, one
doesn’t have to think.
<p>Thinking starts when the patterns of acting need to be corrected according
to incoming signals that are different than in training conditions.
<p>Information processing on all levels in countering Terrorism is one
of the keywords. Information warfare too, has become reality on the front
line of counter-terrorist operations.
<p>To simply react to someone with a gun does not necessarily mean to engage
the terrorist!
