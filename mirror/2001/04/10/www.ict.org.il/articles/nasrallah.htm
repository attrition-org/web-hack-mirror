Authority</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Boaz Ganor,</B>
<BR><B>ICT Director</B>

<P>Hizballah leader Hasan Nasrallah’s calls to assassinate Arafat--like
similar threats leveled against the Palestinian Authority and its chairman
on the part of Hamas--should be seen as a concrete risk to Arafat and other
leaders of the PA. Although similar threats have been heard from Syria,
Lebanon and from within Palestinian Authority territory, we need to differentiate
between those of Hizballah and Hamas in order to determine their significance:

<P><B>The Hizballah Threat</B>
<BR>The recent declarations of Hizballah’s leader against the leaders of
the Palestinian Authority are evidence of an intensification of the organization’s
opposition to the Oslo accords. However, these proclamations do not represent
merely the personal views of Hizballah’s leadership. They reflect rather
the views of Hizballah’s patrons, Syria and Iran. Its hard to imagine Nasrallah--at
a rally in Damascus, yet--calling for “the elimination of those who pretend
to represent the Palestinian people” without the sanction, or even guidance,
of his Syrian patrons. By the same token, it is unlikely that Nasrallah
would have labeled Arafat “an agent of the Jews who must be eliminated”
at a rally in Lebanon if such an allegation wasn’t supported by his Iranian
patrons. Both countries have at different times--in the past and more recently--expressed
their vehement opposition to the Oslo accords. In this light we should
view Nasrallah’s declarations as an effort on the part of these countries
to influence the internal climate within the Palestinian camp, and to motivate
the Islamic fundamentalists to move against Arafat.

<P><B>The Hamas Threat</B>
<BR>The leaders of Hamas have repeatedly expressed their reluctance to
set off a civil war within the Palestinian arena, and have amply shown
their desire to prevent an open conflict with the Palestinian Authority.
Hamas’ fear of civil war is not merely a matter of “realpolitic” but stems
primarily from the religious belief that such a conflict is abhorrent to
Islam. For this reason the movement’s leadership has so far abstained from
calling on its people to take up arms against the Palestinian Authority
and its leadership; this despite the movement’s vigorous opposition to
peace with--or recognition of--Israel.

<P><B>Where lies the danger?</B>

<P>The chief danger to Chairman Arafat and his colleagues could come from
a number of factors:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Hizballah</B></LI>

<BR>The organization could send an assassin into Palestinian Authority
lands from abroad to make an attempt on Arafat or other leaders of the
PA. Hizballah is also capable of offering a substantial reward to Palestinians
living within PA lands (including those close to Arafat) as motivation
for his assassination.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Hamas</B></LI>

<BR>As mentioned, it isn’t likely that the movement intends to target Arafat
or any other Palestinian leader. However, should Arafat take steps to significantly
undermine the movement’s infrastructure in the territories, or to endanger
the movement itself, then Hamas might alter this policy of restraint. At
that time the movement can be expected to begin acting directly against
Palestinian decision-makers. Unlike the Lebanese Shiite Hizballah, which
lacks supporters and infrastructure in PA territory, the Hamas is a popular
Sunni movement arising out of the Palestinian population. Should its leaders
decide to target Arafat, they will have access to the movement’s extensive
operational apparatus and human resources.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)</B></LI>

<BR>In contrast to the Hamas, the PIJ--like Hizballah--is intimately linked
to both Iran and Syria. Thus, just as Hizballah acts as the rhetorical
arm of its patrons, the PIJ activists could act as their operational arm.
However, the number of PIJ supporters in the territories is relatively
small. It is reasonable to assume that most of these activists are known
to the Palestinian security forces, who would not be slow in pointing out
to them the probable outcome of any actions against the PA.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Individual Initiatives</B></LI>

<BR>In the light of the calls against Arafat on the part of Islamic fundamentalists
outside of the PA territories and of opponents to the peace process from
within the territories, the possibility of an individual initiative to
assassinate the Chairman cannot be ruled. Such an initiative could come
from an individual or group, who--on the basis of religious decree (<I>fatwa</I>)
or some other nationalist rationale--might target Arafat even without the
explicit support of any organization or leadership.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Jewish Extremists</B></LI>

<BR>The possibility should be taken into consideration that Jewish extremists
might attempt to derail the peace process by eliminating Chairman Arafat
and/or other Palestinian leaders. Although such a scenario is possible,
it is far more likely that such a threat would be directed against the
Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu.</UL>
In his address in Damascus Nasrallah also called upon Palestinians to use
all available weapons to kill Jews, even if such action must be taken without
the support of the Palestinian leadership or that of any organization.
This call should be seen as an attempt to motivate extremist elements within
the Palestinian population to perpetrate terrorists attacks, this in defiance
of the policy of the Palestinian Authority, and possibly even in defiance
of the policies of the Hamas leadership.

<P>The seriousness of this utterance lies in the fact that Hizballah’s
patrons are attempting to overcome every obstacle, consideration, or interest
of the Palestinian Authority--and even of Hamas--that might prevent acts
of terror against Israel. Nasrallah is in effect attempting to undermine
the Palestinian leadership’s authority over the Palestinian populace. He
is calling on the extremist elements to disregard the orders of their leaders
and commanders.
