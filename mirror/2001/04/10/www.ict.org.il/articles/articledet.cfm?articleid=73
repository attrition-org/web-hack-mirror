<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The peace process and violent activity</FONT></B>

<P>The Northern Ireland peace process, in the making since June 1996, is
an attempt to find a political solution to 30 years of conflict in Northern
Ireland, and in so doing to finally separate violent activism from politics.
The governments involved have founded the process on the principle that
a real solution is only possible if those linked to the main paramilitary
organizations are involved and accept a complete cease-fire.

<P>However, the three main paramilitary groupings - the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defense
Association (UDA) broke the cease-fire in January 1998. The first and most serious
breaches were made by the UDA, whose activists murdered three Catholic
militants, as part of a so-called “measured military response.”

<P>The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) opposed the talks--on the grounds
that they were biased toward the Catholic nationalists--and seemed ready
to continue the sectarian war of attrition against the Catholics. It was
estimated that if LVF killings continued then Irish National Liberation
Army (INLA) killings would follow, possibly in collusion with the IRA.
The Continuity IRA was also considered a reactionary factor.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bombings and splits</FONT></B><B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>

<P>In February 1998 the IRA again denied press reports that there was any
division in the organization.<B> </B>In spite of the fact that sources
within the IRA claimed that the organization operated as a single organization,
it was believed by many that at some levels of the organization there were divisions
were developing within the IRA. The IRA continued to claim that it had no
“satellite organizations,” and did not provide assistance to other groups.

<P>When accused of involvement in bombings in Moira and Portadown,
it insisted that it was not responsible for any terrorist activity. Since
the IRA was believed to be observing the cease-fire--and indeed had nothing
to gain by breaking it--suspicion fell instead on dissident
IRA members or the Continuity IRA as having carried out the attacks.

<P>A powerful bomb found near the border of the Irish Republic at the end
of February 1998 was, according to police sources, in the process of being prepared
by a republican group for an attack in the North. Though it was unclear
which group was responsible, the incident appeared to fit the pattern of
bombings being carried out by the Continuity IRA (CIRA) group. According
to security sources, the bomb was similar to devices manufactured by Provisional
bomb-makers in the past.

<P>In addition, the CIRA had attacked two hotels in the same area within
the last two years. The CIRA group has two distinct areas of operation
in  Northern Ireland. One is in the west, where bombing teams can cross the border
to carry out attacks. The other is in the east, where activists operate
northwards.

<P>In mid-March 1998 four major republican bombing operations were intercepted.
Estimates were that had these attacks gone forward, they could have caused
millions of pounds worth of property damage. One of the most
powerful devices ever intercepted was a 1,300 lb. bomb discovered in Dundalk,
ready for use. Had it exploded in a town center or near a security base
in Northern Ireland, it would have caused massive devastation.

<P>A group of IRA members who oppose the current IRA cease-fire was accused
of making efforts, on both political and military fronts, to destabilize
the cease-fire and the peace process. Irish security sources affirmed that
those responsible for the Dundalk bomb were supporters of the Sinn F&eacute;in
dissident group known as the “32 County Sovereignty Committee.” Although
it has aims broadly similar to the Continuity IRA, this particular group
has opted not to become a separate organization.

<P>On March 24, 1998, Republican paramilitary forces carried out a mortar-bomb
attack on a Northern Ireland police station. This attack followed a previous
mortar attack on another police base earlier in the month. These attacks
could have been carried out either by the Continuity IRA or IRA dissidents
loyal to the former IRA quartermaster general.

<P>Security sources believed the attack was in fact carried out by members
of the IRA's 1st Battalion who resigned from the organization, together
with Mickey McKevitt, its former quartermaster-general, in the fall of 1997 in protest of
the peace process.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The new “IRA” structures</FONT></B>

<P>The IRA dissidents who resigned from the mainstream republican movement
eventually regrouped in order to set up a new organization, which they
are calling the IRA, or “real” IRA. The group includes a number of the IRA's 12-strong
“army executive,” who resigned, along with quartermaster-general McKevitt
in protest of the official IRA support for the peace process. The dissidents
formed a new IRA “army executive,” which was to elect an army council to
run the new organization. The group is small in number and has suffered
heavy setbacks at the hands of the Irish police.

<P>Although the dissidents share similar political views to the 32-County Sovereignty
Committee, they constitute an entirely separate organization from the Continuity
IRA. They opposed Sinn Fein's continued participation in the Stormont
talks and any Sinn Fein involvement in an assembly in Northern Ireland.

<P>The Continuity IRA, split from the main Sinn Fein/IRA
movement in 1986, led by RSF president, Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Br&aacute;daigh.
Its first serious terrorist attack was in July 1996 when it blew up the
Killyhevlin Hotel, outside Enniskillen. The CIRA is the military wing of
the small political party, Republican Sinn Fein (RSF).

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Cooperation between IRA dissidents against the settlement</FONT></B>

<P><B>The Continuity IRA and the “real” IRA</B>
<BR>The <I>Irish Times</I> reported on May 26, 1998 that “the IRA group,
which supports the political line of the group known as the 32-County Sovereignty
Committee and which has styled itself the “real” IRA, has aligned itself
with those calling themselves the Continuity IRA (CIRA).”

<P>According to security sources the two dissident groups, though previously
cautious of cooperating with one another, joined forces to
share information and materials for terrorist activity. The “real” IRA's
stated intentions are to damage the peace and to undermine the IRA and
Sinn Fein’s leadership.

<P>The leader of the “real” IRA group is an ex-IRA man formerly responsible
for arms shipments into Northern Ireland. His group has access to quantities
of Semtex plastic explosive, detonators and a variety of other bomb-making
components. In addition one of the IRA's former leading bomb-makers has
joined the “real” IRA group. He is suspected of constructing bombs for
both his group and the CIRA, which previously had only limited bomb-making
skills. Another ex-IRA engineer, who was involved in constructing mortars,
also joined the “real” IRA group and is believed to have made the mortars
used in attacks on security bases in the early spring.

<P><B>The Continuity IRA and the Irish National Liberation Army</B>

<P>According to Irish sources the CIRA is also closely allied with yet
another dissident republican group, the Irish National Liberation Army
(INLA), which is said to be supplying the CIRA group with tactical expertise.

<P>The INLA is a small Irish nationalist group, which has been responsible
for four murders in Northern Ireland since the December 27th 1997 killing
by some of its members of Billy Wright, a loyalist Protestant militant.
That incident set off a spate of retaliatory sectarian murders, in which
eight Catholics were killed.

<P>The INLA began as the military wing of the Irish Republican Socialist
Party, itself a faction that broke with the Official IRA in 1974. INLA
aims to use armed struggle to force British troops out of northern Ireland,
to force unification of the northern six counties with the rest of Ireland,
and to overthrow the current Republic of Ireland in favor of a Marxist-Leninist
revolutionary state.

<P>Past INLA terrorist activities have included not only bombings and shootings
against British and Ulster officials, security forces, Protestant loyalists,
and members of Protestant militias but also violent confrontations with
both the Official and Provisional wings of the IRA as well as within the
INLA itself. The struggles with the older IRA groups lasted from 1974 until 1977, when
INLA founder Seamus Costello was murdered by unknown assailants.

<P>The <I>London Observer</I> reported on 1<SUP>st</SUP> of June 1998 that
the three groups had met in Dundalk to discuss uniting under a single command.
This was later confirmed by Irish security sources. Reportedly, the two
organizations agreed to increase cooperation and to share bomb-making materials
with one another.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Weapons and modus-operandi</FONT></B>
<BR>No paramilitary organization - even those which ostensibly support
the Belfast Agreement - is prepared to surrender its weapons. The <I>Irish
Times</I> reports that hundreds of tons of weapons are said to be cached
all over Ireland, “from bunkers in the midlands and southwest of Ireland
to concrete-lined holes under kitchens in houses across Northern Ireland.”

<P>Terrorist groups possess a variety of conventional firearms, ranging
from homemade guns, to Soviet-manufactured SAM-7 ground-to-air missiles
smuggled from Libya by the IRA in the mid-1980s. Reportedly, the four ships
that smuggled these weapons from Libya also carried thousands of boxes
of ammunition, now presumed to be buried somewhere in the Republic of Ireland.

<P>The IRA has only once been known to make use of a SAM-7. In 1989 it
fired one at a British army helicopter. The only IRA man known to have
the expertise to operate the missile system was subsequently jailed. However,
he has since been released. It is not known whether the organization is
capable of using the two or three SAM-7s, believed to remain in its arsenal.

<P>More ominous still, are some 2,500 to 3,000 kilograms of the plastic explosive,
Semtex, believed to be in the hands of the Provisional IRA. Between 1984 and
1987 the IRA smuggled 6,000 kg of the explosive into the Irish Republic in
four shipments. It is estimated that since then only about half of it has
been used or recovered by security forces. The rest is still at large.

<P>Irish police sources believe that the IRA's intends to hold on to its
Semtex for future use, should the political process fail to live up to
the group’s expectations. Semtex will thus remain the most important “strategic”
weapon in the IRA arsenal and the most dangerous weapon held by any Irish
terrorist organization. It is believed that some Semtex has fallen into
the hands of dissident republicans, both the Continuity IRA, and the dissident
IRA group that shares the political views of the 32-County Sovereignty
Committee.

<P>The INLA was never known to use Semtex
until the group claimed responsibility for a roadside bomb left in the
area of west Belfast in April 1998. Although INLA members were previously
known to have bomb-making skills, it is also possible that members of the
“real” IRA prepared the bomb for the INLA. The <I>Irish Times</I> reported
that the INLA acquired two boxes of commercial explosive in the mid 1990s
from a source in New Zealand and was expected to use them for terrorist
attacks.

<P>Some time between 1994 and 1996 the two main Protestant terrorist groups,
the UDA and UVF, smuggled several hundred AK47s, Uzi sub-machineguns and
handguns into Northern Ireland. The shipment was split between the two
organizations, and both are believed to have at least 200 modern automatic
weapons.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The lessons of the latest international terrorist attacks</FONT></B>

<P>The terrorist escalation in Northern Ireland developed in step with
the political process, which finally, in April 1998, accomplished a peace
agreement between the parties involved. The agreement was consecrated by
70% of the voters in the Northern Ireland referendum. It would seem that
terrorism these days is an integral part of any settlement involving an
ethnical or religious conflict.

<P>It is astonishing how reminiscent the Northern Ireland situation is
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the escalation in Hamas and Palestinian
Islamic Jihad terrorist activity just when the peace process seemed likely
to bear its first fruits. Likewise, the Sinhalese-Tamil conflict in Sri
Lanka has escalated several times in the past while negotiations were in
process and agreements seemed within reach.

<P>There is another conclusion from the murderous car bomb attack in Omagh,
following so closely on the heals of the twin car-bombings in Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salam, the massacres by Islamists in Algeria, and the killing of
tourists in Luxor. That is that modern terrorist organizations are ready
to imitate each other in the escalation game, and are less and less impressed
by the number of the innocent victims they murder. The car bomb has thus
become one of the strategic weapons in the hands of merciless terrorists.

<P>It would seem that analysts who have been forecasting a worsening in
the patterns of terrorist attacks worldwide and an increase in the human
and material price paid by civilian societies have been proved disastrously
right.
