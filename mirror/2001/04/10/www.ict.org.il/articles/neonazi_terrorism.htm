<br><b>Jewish Community Security Trust, London</b>
<p>When three bombs exploded in London in Spring 1999, targeting the capital’s
black, Asian and gay communities, the threat of neo-Nazi terrorism finally
seemed to have become a reality. By the time David Copeland, the bomber,
was arrested, 3 people had been killed and over 100 injured by the nail
bombs. Within a few weeks of his arrest, Copland’s far right connections
were made very clear by the publication of photographs showing him standing
next to John Tyndall, then the leader of the BNP, at the party’s 15<sup>th</sup>
anniversary celebrations in 1997. Far from being a loner as he was initially
portrayed, David Copeland is simply another demonstration of the direct
line between the incitement-filled, hate-driven ideology of the far right,
and the kind of murderous violence seen in London last year.
<p>At around the same time as the nail bomb campaign, another Londoner,
James Shaw, was arrested late one night after attacking a bus driver. When
police were called, they discovered that Shaw was carrying not only a knife,
but also two homemade bombs. A search of Shaw’s home unearthed three more
bombs, which he intended to use to blow up railway lines, along with pages
and pages of racist writings, hate-mail, National Front literature and
a photograph of Hitler. Shaw, like Copeland, acted on his own, but was
no loner: he was a supporter of the National Front during its heyday in
the 1970s. Shaw is now serving nine years in prison, and is yet another
example of the kind of person attracted by the far right’s cocktail of
hate and violence. Even Shaw’s own barrister admitted: “He has a pathological
interest in bombs and hates everyone.”
<p>Similarly, Stuart Kerr was imprisoned for 12 years in November for petrol-bombing
an Asian-owned shop in Chichester. Taking up the idea that the state, in
the form of the Zionist Occupational Government (ZOG), is the greatest
enemy, he also firebombed a police car before he was arrested. The police,
who were told by Kerr that he is “a racist and a supporter of the British
National Party,” found piles of BNP and C18 literature at Kerr’s home,
alongside swastikas and photographs of Hitler. Although not a member of
any far right group, Kerr had been influenced by neo-Nazi football hooligans
at West Ham United. One of these, a convicted hooligan named Matthew Marian,
stood as a BNP candidate in a local election in London in May 1998.
<p>It should really come as little surprise that the far right has turned
to terrorism, given the violent, revolutionary ideology which has been
washing around the global neo-Nazi movement for most of the 1990s. This
is exactly the strategy advocated by Louis Beam, William Pierce and other
American far right ideologues- their calls for leaderless resistance and
white revolution now dominate the neo-Nazi world. The idea that far right
activists should go underground, acting alone or in small cells and strike
out at their perceived enemies was the inspiration behind the formation
of Combat 18 and the Oklahoma bombing. Nor are these ideas limited to the
radical extreme of C18; one of the BNP’s main organisers, Tony Lecomber,
spent time in prison for trying to bomb the office of a left wing group
in the 1980s, while more recently, William Pierce, the author of <i>Hunter</i>
and <i>The Turner Diaries</i> and the architect of modern neo-Nazi terrorism,
addressed the BNP Annual Rally in 1995. Copeland was active in the BNP
in East London from early 1997, and later joined a small C18 splinter group.
He is just as likely to have picked up his violent hatred of not only ethnic
minorities, but also of those who he blames for bringing them to the UK,
from either group.
<p>Pierce’s writings have been expanded upon by several groups. The Charlemagne
Hammer Skins (CHS), a French associate of the C18 splinter group National-Socialist
Movement (NSM), published <i>A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution </i>under
the name Aryan Resistance Movement. This call to arms contained detailed
instructions on subjects such as Methods of Covert Direct Action; Escape
and Evasion; Assassination; Terror Bombing; Sabotage, Racial War, How To
Create A Revolutionary Situation; and Rules of Engagement – Regulations
Concerning the Conduct of Soldiers of the Aryan Liberation Army. Dave Myatt,
a former leader of the NSM, has been arrested in connection with the publication
of what is a detailed, practical terrorist handbook. The publication of
the <i>Practical Guide</i> on the CHS website made it available to far
more people than the small circle of activists in CHS and the NSM, while
leaving the writer completely ignorant of who is influenced to act on his
incitement.
<p>The leaderless resistance theory espoused by C18 in the UK and many
other far right organisations elsewhere was originally designed to protect
fully committed, core group members from state scrutiny. Where the examples
of Copeland, Kerr and indeed Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma differ from this
is that none of them were core members of any group when they carried out
their attacks. Rather, they were individuals whose propensity for violence
and hostility towards others were given shape and meaning by the cultural
and ideological milieu of the far right in which they moved. The fact that
people who were relatively unknown even within their own groups could be
so deeply influenced by the ideas they encountered on the far right that
they became terrorists adds a new and worrying dimension to the threat
posed by neo-Nazi terror. The Oklahoma bomb drew the world’s attention
to <i>The Turner Diaries</i>, Pierce’s notorious work which outlines how
an underground organisation can organise resistance against an oppressive
state. However, it is his other book, <i>Hunter</i>, which appears to be
the model for an increasing number of attacks, whether by committed far
right activists or those on the fringes of the movement. The example of
a lone gunman or bomber, acting on his conscience, with no organisational
back-up or group of supporters who are aware of his campaign, fits not
just David Copeland and Stuart Kerr, but also Buford Furrow and Benjamin
Smith in America. It is certainly much easier for a would-be neo-Nazi terrorist
to simply go out and attack random targets than it is to establish and
run an underground network of cells and activists.
<p>Recent far right terrorism covers the full spectrum, from crude violence
to the most sophisticated kind of attack. In the USA, Furrow and Smith,
who were indeed core members of the Aryan Nations and the World Church
Of The Creator respectively, lived out Pierce’s call to arms in their random
shootings of people from various ethnic minorities. Meanwhile John King,
after taking part in the murder of a black man, James Byrd, in Texas in
1998 by dragging him from the back of a pick-up truck, is said to have
proclaimed: “We’re starting <i>The Turner Diaries</i> early.” In Sweden
far right terrorism has taken on a whole different dimension, with careful
targeting, intelligence gathering and preparation for the most ruthless
kind of attacks. In June last year, Peter Karlsson, an investigative journalist
who specialised in exposing the activities of the far right, and his son
were left seriously injured by a car bomb. Later in the year, Bjorn Soderberg,
a trade unionist who had uncovered far right infiltration of his union
was shot dead on his doorstep. It soon emerged that Anti-AFA, a Swedish
group which gathers information on anti-fascists, had begun collecting
intelligence on Soderberg as soon as his revelations became public. Two
days after the murder, Hampus Hellekant, Jimmy Niklasson and Bjorn Lindberg-Hernlund
- all neo-Nazis connected to Anti-AFA and National Youth/Swedish Resistance
- were arrested on suspicion of murder. Robert Vesterlund, the editor of
the neo-Nazi magazine <i>Info-14</i> whose activities had been exposed
by Soderberg, was later arrested on suspicion of instigating the assassination.
These attacks were preceded by a bungled armed robbery in May which left
two policemen murdered, for which three known neo-Nazis, Tony Olsson, Andreas
Alexandersson and Jackie Arklov, have been jailed for life. Although the
tactic of raising funds through bank robberies is hardly exclusive to far
right groups, it was used in the 1980s by The Order, the American model
for modern neo-Nazi terror.
<p>The danger is increased by the global nature of the modern far right.
After the attempted murder of Peter Karlsson, it was the British Blood
&amp; Honour website that carried the Swedish neo-Nazi movement’s justification
of their violence. The attack on Karlsson was described as “justified self-defense,”
while the two dead policemen “were not innocent … they wore the State’s
uniform to uphold its criminal laws. They took order (sic) from the Jewish
chief of Police and the Soviet minister for justice … People who engage
in this kind of terror, deserve no mercy.” When Austrian police uncovered
a plot in October last year to carry out an armed coup, amongst the weapons,
ammunition, hit-lists and propaganda they also found evidence of links
to neo-Nazis in Britain, America, Germany and the Czech Republic. After
a gay bar in Cape Town was bombed in November, a letter claiming responsibility
for the attack in the name of the White Wolves – a name first used by C18
– listed the dates of the London nail bombs as “Famous Dates In British
History 1999” and referred to Nelson Mandela’s “interfering in the Stephen
Lawrence case in Britain” as justification for the attack.
<p>The German far right also appears to be moving down the same road. In
June 1998 German police discovered large caches of weapons at several locations
around Germany, containing automatic and semi-automatic weapons, shells,
mortars, machine guns and grenades, along with Nazi insignia and uniforms.
In March last year, a bomb exploded at an exhibition about war crimes committed
by the Wehrmacht during World War Two. Believed to have been planted by
neo-Nazis, the bomb showed a level of technical sophistication not previously
seen from the German far right. More recently, further arrests followed
the discovery of bomb-making equipment, including chemicals, timers, batteries,
steel pipes and detonators. The four neo-Nazi activists were arrested,
all believed to be connected to Thorsten Heise, C18’s main contact in Germany.
Further to the east, in Russia, there were three attempted bombings, two
of them successful, of synagogues in Moscow.
<p>Far right violence clearly stepped up a level on an international scale
during the last year of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. Far right groups have
certainly used terrorism in the past, but the ubiquity of neo-Nazi terrorist
attacks in 1999 was a global escalation from which the neo-Nazi movement
is unlikely to retreat. Both the justification and motivation for terrorism
and the strategy by which it should be executed have been available within
the far right ever since William Pierce and Louis Beam penned their incitement-filled
texts. Only in recent years, though, has the technical knowledge needed
to build a bomb been so readily available, not just in neo-Nazi literature
but more particularly, on the Internet. A David Copeland does not need
to be accepted into some inner sanctum in order to become a terrorist;
as a mere foot-soldier in the far right, everything he needs, in terms
of encouragement, method and know-how is so commonly available to him as
to be almost mundane. In these circumstances, any amount of surveillance,
raids and arrests can only go so far; where neo-Nazi terrorism is concerned,
the cat is already out of the bag.
