is another man’s freedom fighter,” has become not only a clich&eacute;,
but also one of the most difficult obstacles in coping with terrorism.
The matter of definition and conceptualization is usually a purely theoretical
issue—a mechanism for scholars to work out the appropriate set of parameters
for the research they intend to undertake. However, when dealing with terrorism
and guerrilla warfare, implications of defining our terms tend to transcend
the boundaries of theoretical discussions. In the struggle against terrorism,
the problem of definition is a crucial element in the attempt to coordinate
international collaboration, based on the currently accepted rules of traditional
warefare.</TD>

<P><A NAME="present"></A><B>Defining Terrorism: The Present Situation</B>

<P>Academics, politicians, security experts and journalists, all use a
variety of definitions of terrorism. Some definitions focus on the terrorist
organizations’ mode of operation.. Others emphasize the motivations and
characteristics of terrorism, the modus operandi of individual terrorists,
etc.

<P>In their book <I>Political Terrorism</I>, Schmidt and Youngman cited
109 different definitions of terrorism, which they obtained in a survey
of leading academics in the field. From these definitions, the authors
isolated the following recurring elements, in order of their statistical
appearance in the definitions[<A HREF="#1">1</A>]: Violence, force (appeared
in 83.5% of the definitions); political (65%); fear, emphasis on terror
(51%); threats (47%); psychological effects and anticipated reactions (41.5%);
discrepancy between the targets and the victims (37.5%); intentional, planned,
systematic, organized action (32%); methods of combat, strategy, tactics
(30.5%).

<P>Respondents were also asked the following question: “What issues in
the definition of terrorism remain unresolved?” Some of the answers follow[<A HREF="#2">2</A>]:
<OL>
<LI>
The boundary between terrorism and other forms of political violence</LI>

The following exchange took place between Ned Walker, Assistant to the
Undersecretary for Middle East Affairs at the U.S. State Department, and
the Hon. Lee Hamilton, chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle
East—under the auspices of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the House
of Representatives—on the background of talks between the US and the PLO.
The remarks will attest to the problems involved in the use of the concept
“terrorism”[<A HREF="#3">3</A>]:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Hamilton:</I> Well, how do you define terrorism, do you
define it in terms of non-combatance?

<P><I>Walker:</I> The State Department definition which is included in
the terrorism report annually defines it in terms of politically motivated
attacks on non-combatant targets.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> So an attack on a military unit in Israel will not
be terrorism?

<P><I>Walker:</I> It does not necessarily mean that it would not have a
very major impact on whatever we were proposing to do with the PLO.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> I understand that, but it would not be terrorism.

<P><I>Walker:</I> An attack on a military target. Not according to the
definition. Now wait a minute; that is not quite correct. You know, attacks
can be made on military targets which clearly are terrorism. It depends
on the individual circumstances.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> Now wait a minute. I thought that you just gave me
the State Department definition.

<P><I>Walker:</I> Non-combatant is the terminology, not military or civilian.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> All right. So any attack on a non-combatant could be
terrorism?

<P><I>Walker:</I> That is right.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> And a non-combatant could include military?

<P><I>Walker:</I> Of course.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> It certainly would include civilian, right?

<P><I>Walker:</I> Right.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> But an attack on a military unity would not be terrorism?

<P><I>Walker:</I> It depends on the circumstances.

<P><I>Hamilton:</I> And what are those circumstances?

<P><I>Walker:</I> I do not think it will be productive to get into a description
of the various terms and conditions under which we are going to define
an act by the PLO as terrorism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The prevalent definitions of terrorism entail difficulties, both conceptual
and syntactical. It is thus not surprising that alternative concepts with
more positive connotations—guerrilla movements, underground movements,
national liberation movements, commandos, etc.—are often used to describe
and characterize the activities of terrorist organizations. Generally these
concepts are used without undue attention to the implications, but at times
the use of these definitions is tendentious, grounded in a particular political
viewpoint. By resorting to such tendentious definitions of terrorism, terrorist
organizations and their supporters seek to gloss over the realities of
terrorism, thus establishing their activities on more positive and legitimate
foundations. Naturally, terms not opposed to the basic values of liberal
democracies, such as “revolutionary violence,” “national liberation,” etc.,
carry fewer negative connotations than the term, “terrorism.”

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><A NAME="revolution"></A><B>Terrorism or Revolutionary Violence?</B>

<P>Salah Khalef (Abu Iyad) was Yasser Arafat’s deputy and one of the leaders
of Fatah and Black September. He was responsible for a number of lethal
attacks, including the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
In order to rationalize such actions, he used the tactic of confounding
“terrorism” with “political violence,” stating,
<BLOCKQUOTE>“By nature, and even on ideological grounds, I am firmly opposed
to political murder and, more generally, to terrorism. Nevertheless, unlike
many others, I do not confuse revolutionary violence with terrorism, or
operations that constitute political acts with others that do not.”[<A HREF="#4">4</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Abu Iyad tries to present terrorism and political violence as two different
and unconnected phenomena. The implication of this statement is that a
political motive makes the activity respectable, and the end justifies
the means. I will examine this point below.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="liberation"></A><B>Terrorism or National Liberation?</B>

<P>A rather widespread attempt to make all definitions of terrorism meaningless
is to lump together terrorist activities and the struggle to achieve national
liberation. Thus, for instance, the recurrently stated Syrian official
position is that Syria does not assist terrorist organizations; rather,
it supports national liberation movements. President Hafez el-Assad, in
a November 1986 speech to the participants in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Convention
of Workers Unions in Syria, said the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have always opposed terrorism. But terrorism is one thing
and a national struggle against occupation is another. We are against terrorism…
Nevertheless, we support the struggle against occupation waged by national
liberation movements.[<A HREF="#5">5</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
The attempt to confound the concepts of “terrorism” and “national liberation”
comes to the fore in various official pronouncements from the Arab world.
For instance, the fifth Islamic summit meeting in Kuwait, at the beginning
of 1987, stated in its resolutions that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The conference reiterates its absolute faith in the need to
distinguish the brutal and unlawful terrorist activities perpetrated by
individuals, by groups, or by states, from the legitimate struggle of oppressed
and subjugated nations against foreign occupation of any kind. This struggle
is sanctioned by heavenly law, by human values, and by international conventions.[<A HREF="#6">6</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
The foreign and interior ministers of the Arab League reiterated this position
at their April 1998 meeting in Cairo. In a document entitled “Arab Strategy
in the Struggle against Terrorism,” they emphasized that belligerent activities
aimed at “liberation and self determination” are not in the category of
terrorism, whereas hostile activities against regimes or families of rulers
will not be considered political attacks but rather criminal assaults.[<A HREF="#7">7</A>]
Here again we notice an attempt to justify the “means” (terrorism) in terms
of the “end” (national liberation). Regardless of the nature of the operation,
when we speak of “liberation from the yoke of a foreign occupation” this
will not be terrorism but a legitimate and justified activity. This is
the source of the clich&eacute;, “One man’s terrorist is another man’s
freedom fighter,” which stresses that all depends on the perspective and
the worldview of the one doing the defining. The former President of the
Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, made the following statement in April 1981,
during the visit of the Libyan ruler, Muamar Qadhafi: “Imperialists have
no regard either for the will of the people or the laws of history. Liberation
struggles cause their indignation. They describe them as ‘terrorism’.”[<A HREF="#8">8</A>]

<P>Surprisingly, many in the Western world have accepted the mistaken assumption
that terrorism and national liberation are two extremes in the scale of
legitimate use of violence. The struggle for “national liberation” would
appear to be the positive and justified end of this sequence, whereas terrorism
is the negative and odious one. It is impossible, according to this approach,
for any organization to be both a terrorist group and a movement for national
liberation at the same time.

<P>In failing to understand the difference between these two concepts,
many have, in effect, been caught in a semantic trap laid by the terrorist
organizations and their allies. They have attempted to contend with the
clich&eacute;s of national liberation by resorting to odd arguments, instead
of stating that when a group or organization chooses terrorism as a means,
the aim of their struggle cannot be used to justify their actions (see
below). Thus, for instance, Senator Jackson was quoted in Benyamin Netanyahu’s
book <I>Terrorism: How the West Can Win</I> as saying,
<BLOCKQUOTE>The idea that one person’s ‘terrorist’ is another’s ‘freedom
fighter’ cannot be sanctioned. Freedom fighters or revolutionaries don’t
blow up buses containing non-combatants; terrorist murderers do. Freedom
fighters don’t set out to capture and slaughter schoolchildren; terrorist
murderers do . . . It is a disgrace that democracies would allow the treasured
word ‘freedom’ to be associated with acts of terrorists.[<A HREF="#9">9</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Professor Benzion Netanyahu also assumed, a priori, that freedom fighters
are incapable of perpetrating terrorist acts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>For in contrast to the terrorist, no freedom fighter has ever
deliberately attacked innocents. He has never deliberately killed small
children, or passersby in the street, or foreign visitors, or other civilians
who happen to reside in the area of conflict or are merely associated ethnically
or religiously with the people of that area… The conclusion we must draw
from all this is evident. Far from being a bearer of freedom, the terrorist
is the carrier of oppression and enslavement . . .[<A HREF="#10">10</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
This approach strengthens the attempt by terrorist organizations to present
terrorism and the struggle for liberation as two contradictory concepts.
It thus plays into the terrorists’ hands by supporting their claim that,
since they are struggling to remove someone they consider a foreign occupier,
they cannot be considered terrorists.

<P>The claim that a freedom fighter cannot be involved in terrorism, murder
and indiscriminate killing is, of course, groundless. A terrorist organization
can also be a movement of national liberation, and the concepts of “terrorist”
and “freedom fighter” are not mutually contradictory.
<BR>&nbsp;

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="innocent"></A><B>Targeting “the innocent”?</B>

<P>Not only terrorists and their allies use the definition of terrorism
to promote their own goals and needs. Politicians in countries affected
by terrorism at times make political use of the definition of terrorism
by attempting to emphasize its brutality. One of the prevalent ways of
illustrating the cruelty and inhumanity of terrorists is to present them
as harming “the innocent.” Thus, in <I>Terrorism: How the West Can Win</I>,
Binyamin Netanyahu states that terrorism is “the deliberate and systematic
murder, maiming, and menacing of the innocent to inspire fear for political
ends.”[<A HREF="#11">11</A>]

<P>This definition was changed in Netanyahu’s third book, <I>Fighting Terrorism</I>,
when the phrase “the innocent” was replaced by the term “civilians”: “Terrorism
is the deliberate and systematic assault on civilians to inspire fear for
political ends.”[<A HREF="#12">12</A>] “Innocent” (as opposed to “civilian”)
is a subjective concept, influenced by the definer’s viewpoint, and therefore
must not be the basis for a definition of terrorism. The use of the concept
“innocent” in defining terrorism makes the definition meaningless and turns
it into a tool in the political game. The dilemma entailed by the use of
the term “innocent” is amply illustrated in the following statement by
Abu Iyad:
<BLOCKQUOTE>As much as we repudiate any activity that endangers innocent
lives, that is, against civilians in countries that are not directly involved
in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we feel no remorse concerning attacks against
Israeli military and political elements who wage war against the Palestinian
people . . . Israeli acts of vengeance usually result in high casualties
among Palestinian civilians—particularly when the Israeli Air Force blindly
and savagely bombs refugee camps—and it is only natural that we should
respond in appropriate ways to deter the enemy from continuing its slaughter
of innocent victims.”[<A HREF="#13">13</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Abu Iyad here clarifies that innocent victims are civilians in countries
that are not directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict (implying that
civilians in Israel, even children and old people, are not innocent), while
he describes Palestinian civilians as innocent victims.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="proposal"></A><B>Proposing a Definition of Terrorism</B>

<P>The question is whether it is at all possible to arrive at an exhaustive
and objective definition of terrorism, which could constitute an accepted
and agreed-upon foundation for academic research, as well as facilitating
operations on an international scale against the perpetrators of terrorist
activities.

<P>The definition proposed here states that <B>terrorism is the intentional
use of, or threat to use violence against civilians or against civilian
targets, in order to attain political aims. </B>This definition is based
on three important elements:
<OL>
<LI>
The essence of the activity—the use of, or threat to use, violence. According
to this definition, an activity that does not involve violence or a threat
of violence will not be defined as terrorism (including non-violent protest—strikes,
peaceful demonstrations, tax revolts, etc.).</LI>

<LI>
The aim of the activity is always political—namely, the goal is to attain
political objectives; changing the regime, changing the people in power,
changing social or economic policies, etc. In the absence of a political
aim, the activity in questwill not be defined as terrorism. A violent activity
against civilians that has no political aim is, at most, an act of criminal
delinquency, a felony, or simply an act of insanity unrelated to terrorism.
Some scholars tend to add ideological or religious aims to the list of
political aims. The advantage of this definition, however, is that it is
as short and exhaustive as possible. The concept of “political aim” is
sufficiently broad to include these goals as well. The motivation—whether
ideological, religious, or something else—behind the political objective
is irrelevant for the purpose of defining terrorism. In this context, the
following statement by Duvall and Stohl deserves mention:</LI>


<P>Motives are entirely irrelevant to the concept of political terrorism.
Most analysts fail to recognize this and, hence, tend to discuss certain
motives as logical or necessary aspects of terrorism. But they are not.
At best, they are empirical regularities associated with terrorism. More
often they simply confuse analysis.[<A HREF="#14">14</A>]
<LI>
The targets of terrorism are civilians. Terrorism is thus distinguished
from other types of political violence (guerrilla warfare, civil insurrection,
etc.). Terrorism exploits the relative vulnerability of the civilian “underbelly”—the
tremendous anxiety, and the intense media reaction evoked by attacks against
civilian targets. The proposed definition emphasizes that terrorism is
not the result of an accidental injury inflicted on a civilian or a group
of civilians who stumbled into an area of violent political activity, but
stresses that this is an act purposely directed against civilians. Hence,
the term “terrorism” should not be ascribed to collateral damage to civilians
used as human shields or to cover military activity or installations, if
such damage is incurred in an attack originally aimed against a military
target. In this case, the responsibility for civilian casualties is incumbent
upon whoever used them as shields.</LI>
</OL>
The proposed definition of terrorism also addresses a lacuna in present
international legislation and international conventions, in order to develop
a fundamental tool for international cooperation against terrorism. In
order to achieve as wide an accord as possible, this definition must be
founded on a system of principles and laws of war, legislated and ratified
in many countries. In other words, in order to reach an accepted definition
of terrorism, we must extrapolate from the existing principles of conventional
warfare (between countries) to arrive at similar principles for non-conventional
warfare (for our purposes, a violent struggle between an organization and
a state). Many countries in the world support the view—and have enshrined
this in international conventions—that we must differentiate between two
types of military personnel who make use of force to attain their aims.
On the one hand there are “soldiers”—members of the military who intentionally
target members of rival armies, and on the other, there are “war criminals”—members
of the military who intentionally harm civilians (see Diagram 1). This
normative and accepted attitude toward military personnel operating in
a situation of conventional warfare enables us to extrapolate to situations
of non-conventional warfare (between an organization and a state), thus
allowing us to distinguish terrorism from guerrilla warfare. As noted,
terrorism is “a violent struggle intentionally using, or threatening to
use, violence against civilians, in order to attain political aims,” whereas
guerrilla warfare is “a violent struggle using (or threatening to use)
violence against military targets, security forces, and the political leadership,
in order to attain political aims.” Terrorism is thus different from guerrilla
warfare in its mode of activity and in the targets chosen by the perpetrators.
The only question to be resolved is whether perpetrators choose to attain
their aims by targeting civilian or military targets?

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="guerilla"></A><B>Guerrilla Warfare vs. Terrorism</B>

<P>Terrorism and guerrilla warfare often serve as alternative designations
of the same phenomenon. The term “terrorism,” however, has a far more negative
connotation, seemingly requiring one to take a stand, whereas the term
“guerrilla warfare” is perceived as neutral and carries a more positive
connotation.

<P>One of the problems accompanying the use of the concept “guerrilla warfare”
stems from its ambiguity. This nebulousness is cited by Yehoshafat Harkabi
in differentiating between “guerrilla warfare” and “guerrilla war.”[<A HREF="#15">15</A>]
Harkabi describes “guerrilla war” as a prolonged war of attrition, with
progressively increasing violence, blurred limits, a fluid line of contact,
emphasizing the human factor. In the course of the war, guerrilla combatants
become regular military forces until victory is attained and one party
is defeated.[<A HREF="#16">16</A>] Similarly, Huntington argues that “guerrilla
warfare is a form of warfare by which the strategically weaker side assumes
the tactical offensive in selected forms, times and places. Guerrilla warfare
is the weapon of the weak.”[<A HREF="#17">17</A>] Harkabi points out that
terrorism frequently appears in guerrilla war, and indicates that “guerrilla
activity is best placed on a sequence, ranging from sporadic terrorist
attacks not necessarily against military units, up to sustained guerrilla
warfare and confrontation with military forces.”[<A HREF="#18">18</A>]
Others view guerrilla war and terrorism as two separate points along one
sequence dealing with the use of violence.[<A HREF="#19">19</A>]

<P>Other scholars, however, choose to draw a clearer distinction between
guerrilla warfare and terrorism. Thus, for instance, Walter Laqueur writes:
“Urban terrorism is not a new stage in guerrilla war, but differs from
it in essential respects, and [that] it is also heir to a different tradition.”[<A HREF="#20">20</A>]
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essence of guerrilla warfare is to establish foci, or liberated
areas, in the countryside and to set up small military units which will
gradually grow in strength, number and equipment . . . in order to fight
battles against government troops. In the liberated areas, the guerrillas
establish their own institutions, conduct propaganda and engage in other
open political activities. None of this applies to terrorists, whose base
of operation is in the cities, and who have to operate clandestinely in
small units.[<A HREF="#21">21</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Ehud Sprinzak sums up this approach as follows: “Guerrilla war is a small
war – subject to the same rules that apply to big wars, and on this it
differs from terrorism.”[<A HREF="#22">22</A>] David Rapaport adds: “The
traditional distinguishing characteristic of the terrorist was his explicit
refusal to accept the conventional moral limits which defined military
and guerrilla action.”[<A HREF="#23">23</A>]

<P>As opposed to Laqueur, Paul Wilkinson distinguishes between terrorism
and guerrilla warfare by stressing another aspect–harm to civilians:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Guerrillas may fight with small numbers and often inadequate
weaponry, but they can and often do fight according to conventions of war,
taking and exchanging prisoners and respecting the rights of non-combatants.
Terrorists place no limits on means employed and frequently resort to widespread
assassination, the waging of ‘general terror’ upon the indigenous civilian
population.[<A HREF="#24">24</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B><I>Diagram 2</I></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../graphics/define2.gif" HEIGHT=416 WIDTH=400></CENTER>


<P>The proposed definition, as noted, distinguishes terrorism from guerrilla
activity according to the intended target of attack. The definition states
that if an attack deliberately targets civilians, then that attack will
be considered a terrorist attack, whereas, if it targets military or security
personnel then it will be considered a guerrilla attack. It all depends
on who the intended victims are. First and foremost, this definition is
meant to answer the need for analyzing and classifying specific events
as “terrorism” or “guerrilla activities.”

<P>This definition is not meant to differentiate between the types of perpetrating
organizations. Most organizations resorting to violence for the purpose
of attaining political aims have not refrained from harming civilians as
well as military personnel. These organizations, then, can be defined as
both terrorist organizations <I>and</I> guerrilla movements.

<P>Although the proposed definition relates to specific att, it is still
possible to deduce from it whether a particular organization is a terrorist
organization or a guerrilla movement. One could, for instance, rely on
a quantitative principle—comparing the numbers of terrorist attacks and
guerrilla attacks within the total number of violent activities involving
the organization. Or one could rely on a qualitative principle, stating
that every organization engaging in attacks against civilian targets is
a terrorist organization, and it is irrelevant whether at the same time
the same organization was also involved in guerrilla activities. Hence,
the claim that every guerrilla organization has also harmed civilians does
not affect the proposed definition of terrorism. A situation where organizations
are involved simultaneously in terrorism and guerrilla activity is a direct
consequence of the lack of an accepted international definition for terrorism
and guerrilla warfare. Only a definition agreed upon by most countries
in the world—and which entails operative action against terrorist groups
different from that directed against guerrilla groups—will move these organizations
to take “cost-benefit” considerations into account when choosing the mode
of activity appropriate to attaining their ends. When the damage incurred
by organizations due to their engagement in terrorism is greater than the
damage they incur due to their involvement in guerrilla activities, it
is plausible to assume that some organizations will choose to focus on
guerrilla activities rather than on terrorism. As long as there is no accepted
international convention for distinguishing terrorism from guerrilla activity—and
as long as such convention is not accompanied by different levels of punitive
sanctions—it should come as no surprise that organizations choose to engage
in terrorism or in guerrilla activities according to their own operative
limitations or circumstances.

<P>Nor does the claim that terrorism and guerrilla activities are on one
conceptual sequence—to the extent that it has empirical backing—contradict
the classification of terrorism and guerrilla activity according to the
proposed definition. A situation is certainly possible in which an organization
might decide to move from the stage of terrorism to the stage of guerrilla
warfare, and vice-versa, thereby changing its character from one involved
only in, or mainly in, terrorism, to one involved mainly in guerrilla warfare.

<P>&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="individual"></A><B>Individual Terrorism and Urban Guerrilla
Warfare</B>

<P>The proposed definition divides terrorism and guerrilla warfare into
four sub-groups: (1) individual terrorism as opposed to (2) indiscriminate
terrorism, and (3) rural guerrilla warfare as opposed to (4) urban guerrilla
warfare (see Diagram 2). Rural guerrilla warfare then, is “the use of violence
against military personnel and security forces in their area of deployment,
activity and transport, in order to attain political aims.” In contrast,
urban guerrilla warfare involves “targeting a specific urban military facility
or attacking a member of the military/security forces, or a political leader
at the decision-making level, in order to achieve political aims.” Indiscriminate
terrorism entails “using violence against a civilian target, without regard
to the specific identity of the victims—in order to spread fear in a population
larger than that actually affected—with the purpose of attaining political
aims.” In contrast, individual terrorism entails “using violence against
a specific civilian target, or attacking a civilian who embodies a symbol
to the public or to the attackers, but who does not function as a political
leader at the decision-making level.”

<P>One of the thorniest issues in defining terrorism and guerrilla activity
is the fine line separating urban guerrilla activity from individual terrorism.
Both represent the convergence of terrorism with guerrilla warfare, and
are sometimes used interchangeably. In fact, urban guerrilla warfare is
often used synonymously with terrorism. Schmidt argues that “the equation
‘terrorism = (urban) guerrilla warfare’ is one which has not only been
used for political propaganda or conversely for guilt attribution, but
has been employed also by social and political scientists.”[<A HREF="#25">25</A>]

<P>According to the above definitions, the difference between individual
terrorism and urban guerrilla warfare again hinges on the identity of the
intended target. An attack against military personnel, or against a leading
decision-maker who formulates policy (including counter-terrorist policy),
could be considered, according to the proposed definition, an “urban guerrilla”
activity. However, if the target is a civilian not acting in a decision-making
capacity, but merely someone who is at most a political or social symbol
(a well known singer, a journalist, a past leader, a judge, the head of
a community or ethnic group, etc.), this will be an act of “individual
terrorism” according to the proposed definition.

<P>&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="aims"></A><B>The Aims of Terrorism and of Guerrilla Warfare</B>

<P>For the purpose of defining terrorism, the type of goal sought is irrelevant
(so long as the goal is political). The terrorist and the guerrilla fighter
may have the exact same aims, but they choose different means to accomplish
them.

<P>Among the political aims that different organizations (both terrorist
organizations and guerrilla movements) seek to achieve we might mention:
national liberation (liberating territory from an occupying power); revolution
(changing the government); anarchism (creating chaos); changing the prevalent
socio-economic system, etc. By characterizing terrorism as a mode of operation
directed against civilian targets, as opposed to basing the definition
on the <I>goals</I> of the violence, we refute the slogan that “one man’s
‘terrorist’ is another man’s ‘freedom fighter’.” This distinction between
the target of the attack and its aims shows that the discrepancy between
“terrorism” and “freedom fighting” is not a subjective difference reflecting
the personal viewpoint of the definer. Rather it constitutes an essential
difference, involving a clear distinction between the perpetrators’ aims
and their mode of operation. As noted, an organization is defined as “terrorist”
because of its mode of operation and its target of attack, whereas calling
something a “struggle for liberation” has to do with the aim that the organization
seeks to attain.

<P>Diagram 2 illustrates that non-conventional war (between a state and
an organization), may include both terrorism and guerrilla activities on
the background of different and unrelated aims. Hiding behind the guise
of national liberation does not release terrorists from responsibility
for their actions. Not only is it untrue that “one man’s terrorist is another
man’s freedom fighter” but it is also untrue that “the end justifies the
means.” The end of national liberation may, in some cases, justify recourse
to violence, in an attempt to solve the problem that led to the emergence
of a particular organization in the first place. Nevertheless, the organization
must still act according to the rules of war, directing its activities
toward the conquest of military and security targets; in short, it must
confine itself to guerrilla activities. When the organization breaks these
rules and intentionally targets civilians, it becomes a terrorist organization,
according to objective measures, and not according to the subjective perception
of the definer.

<P>It may be difficult at times to determine whether the victim of an attack
was indeed a civilian, or whether the attack was intentional. These cases
could be placed under the rubric of a “gray area,” to be decided in line
with the evidence and through the exercise of judicial discretion. The
proposed definition may therefore be useful in the legal realm as a criterion
for defining and categorizing the perpetrators’ activities. In any event,
adopting the proposed definition of terrorism will considerably reduce
the “gray area” to a few marginal cases.

<P>&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="states"></A><B>Defining States’ Involvement in Terrorism</B>

<P>On the basis of this definition of terrorism and guerrilla warfare,
how should we define the involvement of states in the peof terrorist attacks?
Note that violent activities committed by a state against civilians are
forbidden by international conventions and are clearly defined as “war
crimes” (in the context of a war situation) and as “crimes against humanity”
(in other situations). Thus, whereas these definitions have led to the
international delegitimation of the use of violence against civilians by
military personnel and political leaders, a lacuna still exists concerning
the use of violence against civilians by organizations or individuals on
political grounds.

<P>States can be involved in terrorism in various ways: from various levels
of general support for terrorist organizations, through operational assistance,
initiating or directing attacks, and up to the perpetration of terrorist
attacks by official state agencies. All forms of state involvement in terrorism
are usually placed under the general category of “terrorist states,” or
“state sponsored terrorism.” Such a designation has taken on the character
of a political weapon; rival states ascribe it to one another, and terrorist
organizations use it against states acting against them.

<P>The question of state involvement in terrorist attacks has been extensively
discussed in <I>Countering State-Sponsored Terrorism</I> (ICT Papers, No.
1). There we suggest the following classification of states according to
their level of involvement in terrorism:
<OL>
<LI>
“<B>States supporting terrorism</B>” - states that support terrorist organizations,
providing financial aid, ideological support, military or operational assistance.</LI>

<LI>
“<B>States operating terrorism</B>” - states that initiate, direct and
perform terrorist activities through groups outside their own institutions.</LI>

<LI>
“<B>States perpetrating terrorism</B>” - states perpetrating terrorist
acts abroad through their own official bodies–members of its security forces
or its intelligence services, or their direct agents. In other words, states
intentionally attacking civilians in other countries in order to achieve
political aims without declaring war.[<A HREF="#26">26</A>] As mentioned
above, according to international conventions, intentional acts of aggression
against civilians by official agencies of a state, either at times of war
or in occupied territories, will be considered war crimes rather than terrorism.</LI>
</OL>
Various countries have engaged in attacks against leading activists of
terrorist organizations—planners and initiators of attacks, commanders
of operational units, saboteurs and even the organizations’ leaders. On
such grounds, these countries have often been accused of engaging in terrorism
themselves. According to the proposed definition of terrorism (and setting
aside questions bearing on the legitimate confines of a struggle against
terrorism and on the rights of states to fight terrorists in the territory
of another sovereign state), actions by a state against terrorist activists
cannot be defined as “terrorism,” even if only because the latter are not
actually civilians. Individuals engaging in terrorist activities, even
if not wearing a uniform, exclude themselves from the civilian community,
and rules protecting civilians no longer apply to them. Thus, just as the
definition views decision-makers as “legitimate” targets in guerrilla warfare,
so targeting terrorists who head operational, administrative or political
branches in a terrorist organization should not itself be considered a
terrorist activity, since these are the people responsible for policy formulation
and decision making in the organization.

<P>&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="importance"></A><B>The Importance of Defining Terrorism</B>

<P>As noted, defining terrorism is not merely a theoretical issue but an
operative concern of the first order. Terrorism is no longer a local problem
of specific countries but an issue involving a number of international
aspects. Terrorist organizations may perpetrate attacks in a variety of
countries; the victims of attacks can be of different nationalities; the
offices, headquarters, and training camps of terrorist organizations function
in various countries; terrorist organizations receive direct and indirect
assistance from different states, enlist support from different ethnic
communities, and secure financial help throughout the world. Since terrorism
is an international phenomenon, responses to terrorism must also be on
an international scale. Developing an effective international strategy
requires agreement on what it is we are dealing with, in other words, we
need a definition of terrorism. International mobilization against terrorism,
such as that which began in the mid-nineties and culminated in the international
conventions in the G-7 countries, the Sharem el-Sheik Conference, etc.,
cannot lead to operational results as long as the participants cannot agree
on a definition. Without answering the question of “what is terrorism,”
no responsibility can be imposed on countries supporting terrorism, nor
can steps be taken to combat terrorist organizations and their allies.

<P>Without a definition of terrorism, it is impossible to formulate or
enforce international agreements against terrorism. A conspicuous example
of the need to define terrorism concerns the extradition of terrorists.
Although many countries have signed bilateral and multilateral agreements
concerning a variety of crimes, extradition for political offenses is often
explicitly excluded, and the background of terrorism is always political.
This loophole allows many countries to shirk their obligation to extradite
individuals wanted for terrorist activities. It isn’t only countries like
Italy and France that have refrained from extraditing terrorists, adducing
political motives. In the U.S. too, in June 1988, a Brooklyn judge rejected
the plea of a federal prosecutor requesting the extradition of Abed El
Atta (an American citizen suspected of participating in an attack against
a bus in the West Bank in April 1986, in which four people were killed).
The judge stated that this attack was a “political act,” part of the uprising
in the occupied territories, and instrumental in the attainment of the
PLO’s “political aims.” “In the West Bank, today’s rebels could be tomorrow’s
rulers.” According to the judge, this is a “political charge,” excluded
from the category of crimes included in the extradition treaty between
Israel and the United States.
<CENTER><B><I>Diagram 3</I></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../graphics/define3.gif" HEIGHT=280 WIDTH=400></CENTER>
In fact, the need for a definition of terrorism can be seen at almost every
phase of contending with terrorism (see Diagram 3). Such phases include:
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Legislation and punishment</B> – the laws and regulations enacted to
provide security forces with an instrument for combating terrorism. A definition
of terrorism is necessary when legislating laws designed to ban terrorism
and assistance to terrorism, as well as when setting minimum sentences
for terrorists or confiscating their financial resources and supplies.
Barring an accepted definition, this legislation has no value. Legislation
and punishment must distinguish terrorism from ordinary crime, even when
they might actually be identical in practice. The need for a separate legislation
and punishment for terrorism stems from the enormous danger that terrorism,
due to its political dimension, as opposed to crime, poses to society and
its values, to the government in power, and to the public at large.</LI>

<LI>
<B>International cooperation</B> – An internationally accepted definition
of terrorism is required to strengthen cooperation between countries in
the struggle against terrorism, and to ensure its effectiveness. This need
is particularly obvious in all that concerns the formulation and ratification
of international conventions against terrorism—conventions forbidding the
perpetration of terrorist acts, assistance to terrorism, transfer of funds
to terrorist organizations, state support for terrorist organizations,
commercial ties with states sponsoring terrorism–and conventions compelling
the extradition of terrorists.</LI>

<LI>
<B>States sponsoring terrorism</B> – modern terrorism is increasingly dependent
on the support of nations. States sponsoring terrorism use terrorist organizations
as a means to their own ends, while these organizations depend on the assistance
they receive from such countries at the eco, military, and operational
levels. Some organizations are so closely dependent on the assistance of
states that they become “puppets” functioning at the initiative, direction,
and with the complete support of these states. It is impossible to contend
effectively with terrorism without severing the close tie between the terrorist
organizations and the sponsoring states. This tie, however, cannot be severed
without agreeing on a broad definition of terrorism, and thus of the states
that sponsor it and of the steps to be taken against them.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Offensive action</B> – the state struggling against terrorism must retain
the initiative. At the same time, attempts must be made to limit, as far
as possible, the operative capacity of the terrorist organization. To attain
these aims, a continued offensive must be conducted against terrorist organizations.
While countries on the defensive naturally enjoy the sympathy of others,
countries on the offensive are usually censored and criticized by others.
To ensure international support for states struggling against terrorism,
and perhaps even for a joint offensive, an internationally accepted definition
of terrorism is required that will distinguish freedom fighting (which
enjoys a measure of legitimacy among nations) from terrorist activity.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Attitudes toward the population supporting terrorism </B>– terrorist
organizations often rely on the assistance of a sympathetic civilian population.
An effective instrument in the limitation of terrorist activity is to undermine
the ability of the organization to obtain support, assistance, and aid
from this population. A definition of terrorism could be helpful here too
by determining new rules of the game in both the local and the international
sphere. Any organization contemplating the use of terrorism to attain its
political aims will have to risk losing its legitimacy, even with the population
that supports its aims.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Public relations</B> – a definition that separates terrorism out from
other violent actions will enable the initiation of an international campaign
designed to undermine the legitimacy of terrorist organizations, curtail
support for them, and galvanize a united international front against them.
In order to undermine the <I>legitimacy</I> of terrorist activity (usually
stemming from the tendency of various countries to identify with some of
the aims of terrorist organizations), terrorist activity must be distinguished
from guerrilla activity, as two forms of violent struggle reflecting different
levels of illegitimacy.</LI>
</OL>
&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">

<P><A NAME="attitude"></A><B>The Attitude of Terrorist Organizations Toward
the Definition</B>

<P>The definition of terrorism does not require that the terrorist organizations
themselves accept it as such. Nevertheless, reaching international agreement
will be easier the more objective the definition, and the more the definition
takes into account the demands and viewpoints of terrorist organizations
and their supporters. The proposed definition, as noted, draws a distinction
between terrorism and guerrilla warfare at both the conceptual and moral
levels. If properly applied, it could challenge organizations that are
presently involved in terrorism to abandon it so as to engage exclusively
in guerrilla warfare. As noted, most organizations active today in the
national and international arena engage in both terrorist activities and
guerrilla warfare; after all, international convention makes no distinction
between the two. Hence, there are no rules defining what is forbidden and
what is allowed in non-conventional war, and equal punishments are imposed
on both terrorists and guerrilla fighters. People perpetrating terrorist
attacks or engaging in guerrilla warfare know they can expect the same
punishment, whether they attack a military installation or take over a
kindergarten. The terrorist attack may be more heavily censored because
it involves children, but the legitimacy of these actions will be inferred
from their political aims. In these circumstances, why not prefer a terrorist
attack that will have far more impact, and will be easier to accomplish,
with much less risk?

<P>The international adoption of the proposed definition, with its distinction
between terrorism and guerrilla warfare—and its concomitant separation
from political aims—could motivate the perpetrators to reconsider their
intentions, choosing military targets over civilian targets—guerrilla warfare
over terrorism–both because of moral considerations and because of “cost-benefit”
considerations.

<P><B>The moral consideration</B> – many terrorist organizations are troubled
by the moral question bearing on their right to harm civilians, and this
concern is reflected in their literature and in interviews with terrorists.
Thus, for instance, an activist of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, Walid Salam, argued in December 1996 that “among activists
of the Popular Front, more and more are opposed to military activities
against civilians, as the one near Ramallah on Wednesday. They do not say
so publicly because of internal discipline and to preserve unity.”[<A HREF="#27">27</A>]
We can also see something of this moral dilemma in Sheik Ahmad Yassin,
the leader of Hamas: “According to our religion it is forbidden to kill
a woman, a baby, or an old man, but when you kill my sister, and my daughter,
and my son, it is my right to defend them.”[<A HREF="#28">28</A>] This
concern might explain why, after attacks on civilian targets, organizations
such as Hamas often make public statements proclaiming that they have attacked
military targets. The moral dilemma does exist, and the opponents of terrorism
must intensify it. When countries acknowledge the principle of relying
on guerrilla warfare to attain legitimate political aims, and unite in
their moral condemnation of terrorism, they increase the moral dilemma
that is already prevalent in terrorist organizations.

<P><B>The utilitarian consideration</B> – If the perpetrators know that
attacking a kindergarten or other civilian target will never be acceptable;
that these attacks will turn them into wanted and extraditable terrorists
and will undermine the legitimacy of their political goals—and that, when
apprehended, they will be punished much more harshly than would guerrilla
fighters—they may think twice before choosing terrorism as their modus
operandi. Adopting the proposed definition of terrorism, formulating rules
of behavior, and setting appropriate punishments in line with the proposed
definition will sharpen the “cost-benefit” considerations of terrorist
organizations. One way of encouraging this trend among terrorist organizations
is, as noted, to agree on different punishments for those convicted of
terrorism and those convicted of guerrilla warfare. Thus, for instance,
the possibility should be considered of bringing to criminal trial, under
specific charges of terrorism, individuals involved in terrorist activities,
while allotting prisoner of war status to those accused of involvement
in guerrilla activities.

<P>The proposed definition of terrorism may indeed help in the struggle
against terrorism at many and varied operative levels. An accepted definition,
capable of serving as a basis for international counter-terrorist activity,
could above all, bring terrorist organizations to reconsider their actions.
They must face the question of whether they will persist in terrorist attacks
and risk all that such persistence entails—loosing legitimacy, incurring
harsh and specific punishments, facing a coordinated international opposition
(including military activity), and suffering harm to sources of support
and revenue. The international community must encourage the moral and utilitarian
dilemmas of terrorist organizations, and establish a clear policy accompanied
by adequate means of punishment on the basis of an accepted definition.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<BR><A NAME="summary"></A><B>Summary</B>

<P>We face an essential need to reach a definition of terrorism that will
enjoy wide international agreement, thus enabling international operations
against terrorist organizations. A definition of this type must rely on
the same principles already agreed upon regarding conventional wars (between
states), and extrapolate from them regarding non-conventional wars (betweean
organization and a state).

<P>The definition of terrorism will be the basis and the operational tool
for expanding the international community’s ability to combat terrorism.
It will enable legislation and specific punishments against those perpetrating,
involved in, or supporting terrorism, and will allow the formulation of
a codex of laws and international conventions against terrorism, terrorist
organizations, states sponsoring terrorism, and economic firms trading
with them. At the same time, the definition of terrorism will hamper the
attempts of terrorist organizations to obtain public legitimacy, and will
erode support among those segments of the population willing to assist
them (as opposed to guerrilla activities). Finally, the operative use of
the definition of terrorism could motivate terrorist organizations, due
to moral or utilitarian considerations, to shift from terrorist activities
to alternative courses (such as guerrilla warfare) in order to attain their
aims, thus reducing the scope of international terrorism.

<P>The struggle to define terrorism is sometimes as hard as the struggle
against terrorism itself. The present view, claiming it is unnecessary
and well-nigh impossible to agree on an objective definition of terrorism,
has long established itself as the “politically correct” one. It is the
aim of this paper, however, to demonstrate that an objective, internationally
accepted definition of terrorism is a feasible goal, and that an effective
struggle against terrorism requires such a definition. The sooner the nations
of the world come to this realization, the better.
