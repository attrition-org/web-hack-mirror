<center><b><font size=+2>A solution to Syrian Terrorism</font></b></center>

<p><b>By Dr. Ely Karmon</b>
<p><i>This article was published in the <b>Middle East Quarterly</b>, Vol.
VI, No. 2, June 1999 and is published here with permission.</i>
<p>On October 20, 1998, the governments of Turkey and Syria signed the
Adana agreement, a remarkable document. In it, Damascus not only agreed
to recognize the Worker’s Party of Kurdistan (Partiya Karkerana Kurdistan,
or PKK) as a terrorist organization but pledged to cease all aid to the
PKK and to deport its leader Abdullah <font face="Miriam">&Ouml;</font>calan
from Syria<font face="Miriam">. (</font><font size=-1>For the agreement’s
full text, first published by the The International Policy Institute for
Counter-Terrorism see <u>Appendix 1</u></font>) Even more striking was
the fact that the government of Hafiz al-Asad carried out this completely
one-sided agreement and implemented the clause about <font face="Miriam">&Ouml;</font>calan’s
expulsion before the agreement had been signed. (<font face="Miriam">&Ouml;</font>calan
then sought refuge from many countries, including Italy and Kenya, and
in February 1999 ended up being captured by Turkish forces.) In other words,
the Adana Agreement represents a total Syrian surrender to Turkish demands<font face="Miriam">.</font>
<p>The stunning success of this muscle-flexing raises an obvious question:
Can Israel, which has many of the same problems with Asad that the Turks
do, also impose its will on the Syrian dictator by threatening him? Could
Damascus thereby be compelled to cease its support for Hizbullah terrorist
and guerrilla activities against Israel, or give up its sponsorship of
extremist Palestinian groups? Have the interminable and now defunct Israeli-Syrian
negotiations in fact been premised on wrong assumptions? These questions
have special import at a moment when, in the aftermath of new casualties
in Lebanon, the Israel public opinion is becoming impatient with the cost
of keeping troops in southern Lebanon and leading politicians are calling
for Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from there.
<p><b><font size=+1>Turkish and Israeli Policy</font></b>
<p>Turkey and Israel have much in common: both are non-Arab, democratic,
Western-oriented states that face violent, often terroristic enemies who
attack within their borders. They oppose Islamic radicalism and regional
instability.[1] Further, they have similar problems with Syria. Turkey’s
relations with Syria have three focal points: a dispute over the Euphrates
River’s water, which Turkey has been increasingly damning; Syrian support
for the PKK; and Syrian irredentist claims over Hatay province, which the
Turks gained from Syria in 1939.[2] Israel has parallel disputes with Syria
over the control of Jordan River’s waters; Syrian support for Hizbullah
and practically all of the Palestinian terrorist organizations; and the
Syrian claim the Golan Heights, under Israel control since 1967.
<p>Until 1995-96, Turkey and Israel had similarly cautious policies toward
what both saw as an extremely tough regime, even with the major difference
that Damascus maintained full diplomatic relations with the former and
a state of war with the latter. “It is almost a truism among Turkish and
non-Turkish analysts,” Malik Mufti affirms, “that Ankara’s foreign policy
has been dominated until now by caution, passivity, and adherence to the
status quo.”[3] Similarly, since 1973, Israeli governments have seen in
Asad the guarantor of a quiet Golan frontier, so they did little to prevent
his aggressive policy in Lebanon or his sabotage of negotiations with the
Palestinians.
<p>For years, Ankara tried, to no avail, to coerce Syria through political
and economic pressure to cease supporting the PKK. It signed agreement
after agreement but found that the Syrian regime violated every one of
them. For its part, Jerusalem has relied on a policy of reaching understandings
with Damascus about “red lines” for the Syrian presence in Lebanon and
its support for the Hizbullah activity in southern Lebanon—only to find
that these too were constantly broken. Turks and Israelis acted mildly
in response to these violations. For example, after officially requesting
the extradition of <font face="Miriam">&Ouml;</font>calan at the beginning
of 1996,, Ankara did nothing more than suspended official contacts with
Damascus to express its displeasure at not being heeded. Likewise, Jerusalem
responded to the Syrian support for Hizbullah and Hamas terrorism campaigns
during the delicate negotiations at Wye Plantation in early 1996 with nothing
more than canceling the talks.
<p>According to Alain Gresh, changes on the Turkish side first took place
in 1996, when several attacks took place in Syria against offices suspected
of sheltering PKK officials; in December a bomb exploded in a bus on the
Damascus-Aleppo route causing eight deaths. Reportedly, the Syrians suspected
a Turkish hand behind the bombing.[4] Beginning in January 1996, the Turkish
government persistently conveyed a series of very tough demands to Damascus
that the Syrians seemingly did not comply with. (<font size=-1>For the
text of the official Turkish demands, see <u>Appendix 2</u>, published
by The International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism</font>). Then,
in September 1998 came the Turkish power play. It came at the end of a
severe crisis that had begun in mid-September 1998, when Ankara began a
series of political and military maneuvers, including an ultimatum from
Turkey’s President Suleyman Demirel that if Damascus did not cease supporting
the PKK, the military option would be used.
<p>Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz requested parliamentary consent for a war
with Syria, although, he said, war was not the desired outcome. In a rare
display of unity, all political parties in Parliament, including the opposition
Islamist party, Fazilet Partisi, approved a declaration calling on Syria
to cut its support for the PKK or be ready to “bear the consequences.”
More remarkable, this tough stance also won support from the virtually
every other quarter, including the military, the media, and the public
at large, all of whom had grown increasingly disillusioned with Ankara’s
inconclusive peace overtures to Syria since 1985.[5] The Turks backed up
their demands with high-profile military moves of an unprecedented nature:
pilots flying reconnaissance sorties along the Syrian border received advance
permission to open fire in the event of any Syrian harassment; mechanized
units took over border patrols; the army canceled leaves and recalled personnel
to bases of the Second Army; and plans were made to evacuate the families
of Turkish diplomats from Damascus. Then Asad capitulated.
<p>This event calls for two explanations: why did the Turkish authorities
decide to take such resolute action when they did? And why did the Syrians
buckle? On the first point, many factors apparently contributed to the
change in approach, including: the recent successes of the Turkish army
and security forces in countering PKK’s activity, significantly weakening
its operational capabilities; at the same time, the PKK seemed to be making
major political advances in Europe. The Turkish military decided to remove
the Islamic Welfare Party from power and reduce Iranian involvement in
their internal affairs as part of the government’s fight against fundamentalist
Islam, and this had implications for Iranian support for the PKK too. The
American missile strikes on Usama bin Ladin’s bases in Afghanistan and
chemical plant in Sudan just a month earlier gave implicit sanction for
a tough Turkish stance; at the same time, the American need for Turkish
support in the Iraqi crisis created favorable conditions. And the dramatic
growth in strategic and other ties to Israel, conveniently to the south
of Syria, gave heart to the Turks to take a stand.
<p>To the surprise of most observers, Asad meekly accepted the Turkish
ultimatum. Reasons for this might include these factors: the evident resolve
of a country of 65 million inhabitants, with the second-largest army in
the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO), to use military force; the fear
of a Turkish-Israeli alliance that would find Syria in a two-front war;
and the perception that the PKK had become a liability.
<p><b><font size=+1>Current Israeli Policy Options</font></b>
<p>Could the Israelis replicate this Turkish success? Their main problem
Syria csouthern Lebanon, where Hizbullah is waga guerrilla and terrorist
war against the Israeli army and fires rockets at the civilian population
in northern Israel. Israeli politicians and top military brass agree that
Damascus is responsible for the provisioning and sponsorship of Hizbullah;
but when they propose ways to end the deadly attacks and Israel’s strategic
weakness, few of them are ready to take on the Syrians. Although the Netanyahu
government has insisted since coming to office in June 1996 that Syria
is behind the violence in southern Lebanon and that the Lebanese government
is merely its puppet regime, its initiatives have focused on finding a
solution in Beirut. Thus, its first major diplomatic initiative was to
offer an Israeli exit from Lebanon in return for a peace treaty with Beirut.
Known as “Lebanon First,” this idea got precisely nowhere. In January 1998,
the Israeli government then pursued the idea of withdrawing according to
its interpretation of U.N. Security Resolution 425, with equally futile
results. The Syrians torpedoed all of Netanyahu’s initiatives for a host
of reasons: they saw these as a ruse to disengage Lebanon from its control,
as a way to release Israel from its Lebanon agony for nothing in return,
and as the loss of card to play in return for Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights. [6]
<p>As the casualties in Lebanon continue year after year, Israelis are
increasingly impatient with the situation there and seek a new approach.
Interestingly, views on this subject divide across the usual political
and ideological lines. Three main schools of thought exist: continue the
status quo (in the hopes of a comprehensive agreement with Damascus); unilateral
withdrawal, either at one time or in stages; or a punitive policy directed
mainly against the Lebanese economic infrastructure and possibly Syrian
targets in Lebanon. Note that none of these resemble the Turkish approach
of dealing directly with Damascus.
<p><i>Status quo</i>. The key political leaders (Prime Minister Netanyahu
and opposition leaders Ehud Barak of Labor and Mordechai of the new Center
Party) maintain that the status quo must be continued until the moment
arrives for real negotiations with the Syrians. This means, in effect,
accepting that Israel must pay the price of constantly losing soldiers
in southern Lebanon. Barak has gone further and publicly promised “to bring
back the boys” from Lebanon within a year of his election as prime minister
and achieve a peace agreement with Syria with all that it implies.[7] Mordechai
has said he would strive to reach a “reasonable compromise” with Israel’s
neighbors, adding that he and his colleagues support the idea of a “territorial
compromise” on the Golan Heights and an agreement on Lebanon to be reached
in talks with Syria.[8] Netanyahu has also promised to bring peace with
Syria and solve quickly the South Lebanon problem if he is elected, without
explaining exactly how he would do this.[9]
<p>Netanyahu has declared indeed that his government, as opposed to the
Labor government, was “working on a logical solution to bring about a responsible
pullout from Lebanon, not at any price, of course, including not at the
price of handing over all of the Golan Heights, which the Labor Party was
willing to give the Syrians.” Barak, who negotiated last year with Netanyahu
on forming a unity government, said that Netanyahu’s positions on the issue
of the Golan Heights are soft; he even warned the residents of the Golan
Heights that they should not trust him, hinting for the first time publicly
at what had already leaked in the press from their secret negotiations:
that he and Netanyahu have similar views about the need to withdraw from
the Golan.[10] Lately, during the first television debate with Netanyahu,
Mordechai also hinted at the PM’s real policy. According to sources close
to Mordechai, Netanyahu sent a message to Asad proposing the retreat from
the Golan if alert stations will be left on the Heights.[11]
<p>The military establishment generally endorse the status-quo approach.
As a senior security source says, “the Israeli public must understand that
the price of keeping Katzrin [a town on the Golan Heights] is thirty dead
soldiers every year in Lebanon.”[12] It sees unilateral withdrawal from
Lebanon as too risky, even if it is in stages as suggested by Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon and other ministers. Nor does it support waging war against
the Lebanese economy, on the grounds that this would not change the strategic
situation.
<p><i>Unilateral withdrawal</i>. This approach has made major gains in
the past year, thanks in good part to the activism of the Four Mothers
movement which developed spontaneously in the aftermath of a helicopter
accident en route to southern Lebanon in February 1997, killing seventy-three
soldiers. Politicians favoring unilateral withdrawal, like the Labor leader
Yossi Beilin and Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani of the Third
Way, argue that Israel can deter attacks from Lebanon just as well from
its own side of the international border as it can from the “security zone”
it maintains in southern Lebanon. Growing number of voices in the military
oppose the present stalemate and support an unilateral withdrawal. According
to some reports, after the latest declarations of Netanyahu, Barak and
Mordechai, the army has begun preparing for withdrawal.[13]
<p>Proponents of this approach claim that Hizbullah has no real interest
in continuing its guerrilla war once it gets Israeli troops out of southern
Lebanon. Despite occasional pronouncements in the contrary, they say, Hizbullah
has never intended to liberate Palestine but only to advance the domestic
social and political goals of its Shi`a constituency. They note that in
fifteen years of fighting, Hizbullah commandos have never once attempted
to cross the Lebanese border into Israel. Advocates of this approach point
out that -— should Hizbullah misbehave -- the withdrawal of troops does
not preclude forceful Israeli action against Lebanon’s infrastructure,
the Syrian-Iranian supply network, or other steps. They also point out
that Israel’s departure from Lebanon changes the rules of the game: Asad
and his allies can no longer justify the Syrian occupation of Lebanon on
the grounds that the Israeli occupiers are there and must be confronted.[15]
<p>Opponents of a unilateral withdrawal argue that Syria would continue
to encourage guerrilla attacks, now on Israel proper, as a way to bring
its government to resume the negotiations over the Golan Heights. And,
they say, Hizbullah would happily play this role, given its own interest
in eliminating Israel and liberating Jerusalem. They also note that Israeli
forces in fact could not reenter Lebanon at will on being attacked. Further,
the South Lebanese Army (SLA) would collapse once the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) leave southern Lebanon, meaning Israel would lose whatever support
it has among the civilian population. Finally, unilateral withdrawal signals
that Hizbullah had successfully broken Israeli public opinion -- encouraging
Hamas and other Palestinian extremists to step up terrorist attacks on
Israeli targets.
<p>Ariel Sharon, supported in the cabinet by Kahalani, proposed a variant
of this unilateral pullback — that it been done in stages. He did so to
enable Israel to observe the Lebanese army’s ability and willingness to
take control of outposts vacated by the IDF, making it possible to gauge
the intentions of Hizbullah and the Lebanese government before the withdrawal
becomes a <i>fait accompli</i>.[16] Critics say that Damascus would not
be satisfied and would find other ways to press Israel to yield the Golan.
Also, in addition to the other shortcomings of full unilateral withdrawal,
gradual withdrawal “completely ignores the SLA, which cast its lot with
Israel years ago, as well as the thousands of Lebanese families associated
with the SLA. Whereas unilateral withdrawal entails an orderly departure
from Lebanon, withdrawal in stages would be a disorderly departure akin
to running away.”[17]
<p><i>Military action against Lebanese targets</i>. politicians or anasupport
this option, which resembles the lines of the Grapes of Wrath operation
in 1. It is very difficult to hit Hizbullah targets, for these are often
schools, clinics, and mosques. And what good would this do? To Kahalani’s
proposal that Israeli planes knock out the Beirut electricity grid, the
military establishment replies that this would unleash a barrage of Katyusha
rockets on northern Israel, resolving nothing, as in years past.
<p><b><font size=+1>The Turkish Option?</font></b>
<p>The one approach the government has not tried is the one that conforms
with its own argument that Syria and Lebanon are inextricably linked —-
tell the Syrians to stop the violence coming out of Lebanon, or else. If
Israel’s leaders agree that Syria lies behind the attacks on their country
from Lebanon, they also agree -- tacitly -- not to advocate taking operational
steps to force Damascus to stop what it is doing.
<p>There are hints of this approach. Uzi Landau, the Likud chairman of
the parliament’s Security and Foreign Affairs Committee, has called for
Israel to adopt the “Turkish model.” Earlier, he proposed the bombing of
Lebanese strategic and infrastructure targets, and only more recently has
he also included Syrian interests in Lebanon. Moshe Arens, the new minister
of defense, before coming to office found it amazing that the Syrians could
sponsor Hizbullah attacks against Israel with impunity and despaired of
his country’s fortitude.
<p>Israel doesn’t seem to have the stamina for this kind of war, and doesn’t
seem to have the sense to change the rules of engagement. This perception
is a clear invitation for an escalation in Hizbullah’s violent activities
against Israel. As long as we insist on fighting shadows, the Syrians will
continue to seem invulnerable.[18]
<p>Since becoming defense minister, however, Arens has dismissed the idea
of embarking on a major military operation in Lebanon but says he has not
made his mind yet what to do.[19] Reports indicate that more military voices
are asking for military pressure on Syria.[20]
<p>Efraim Inbar, director of Bar-Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for
Strategic Studies, is a rare voice calling for a tough approach, saying
that Ankara has a good understanding of the Middle Eastern rules of the
game. He argues that the IDF should end the cost-free Syrian support of
Hizbullah by hitting Syrian targets in Lebanon.[21]
<p>Opponents to “muscled diplomacy” mainly fear that the military option
in Lebanon will lead to a full-scale war with Syria, which would not be
accepted by the majority of the public opinion in Israel, which, to the
contrary, is eager to achieve a peace agreement with Syria. For its part,
the army sees operations against Syrian targets as too dangerous.[22] During
the Turkish-Syrian crisis, it bears noting, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
emphatically declared that Israel had nothing to do with Turkey’s military
move; to calm Syrian fears, he even canceled some military exercise on
the Golan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Arab Reactions</font></b>
<p>Should Israel take the fateful step of threatening and showing force
against Syrian targets unless the violence on its northern border ceases?
Here are some considerations toward a reply:
<p>First, it is risky to think Hizbullah will stop the attacks if Israeli
troops withdraw. Hizbullah’s main goal is to transform Lebanon in an Islamic
state ruled by the <i>Shari’a</i> (Islamic sacred law); the difficulty
of achieving this goal makes the fight against Israel, another important
objective as defined by its February 1985 <u>covenant</u>,[23] a means
both to advance its Islamic credentials and to help its Syrian and Iranian
sponsors. According to Martin Kramer, a leading specialist of Hizbullah
and director of the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel-Aviv University, the organization
would likely take advantage of a power vacuum in the south to attack Israel
and test Israel’s resolution.[24] Indeed, Hasan Nasrallah, Hizbullah’s
secretary-general, has maintained a carefully ambiguous position about
his intentions. He says that Syria, Lebanon, and Hizbullah cannot grant
Israeli security guarantees after it withdraws and hints that Palestinian
cells would infiltrate the border to strike at Israeli targets, perhaps
signaling the methods to be used to fight Israel post-withdrawal.[25] Recently
he has declared, “Hizbullah will continue its fight, until the conquest
of Palestine, from the Jordan River to the sea.”[26] It also bears note
that even if Hizbullah has not sent commandos across the border, it has
twice tried to infiltrate terrorists from abroad to perpetrate terrorist
attacks in Israel: Muhammad Husayn Mikdad, a Lebanese Shi’i, went to Israel
in April 1996 (disguised as a Briton named Andrew Newman) to explode a
bomb in Jerusalem and a German convert to Islam, Steven Smirek, tried to
carry out acts of terror in Tel Aviv in December 1997.
<p>Second, by analyzing Israel’s actions, Asad probably concludes that
Syria has little to fear from the Jewish state in the near future. Should
he accept restarting the negotiations without pre-conditions, Hizbullah
and the rejectionist Palestinian groups give him a powerful tool which
he will assuredly use. As Moshe Zak, the well-known Israeli commentator,
puts it, “Asad knows no mercy; he only recognizes interests.”[27] Further,
according to Abbas Kelidar, then an adviser to Crown Prince Hasan of Jordan,
“Asad was never truly on the ‘brink’ of peace.” Rather, he “wants to appear
engaged in the peace process to improve its position in the region -- that
is, to maintain the Cairo-Riyadh-Damascus axis. Syria also believes that
its engagement in the peace process will be rewarded with international
goodwill.”[28]
<p>Third, according to Ze’ev Schiff, even if the Syrians’ position appears
to have weakened, they can still cause a considerable amount of strategic
damage. Therefore, Israel should exercise care when assessing a possible
Syrian reaction to its military operations.[29] Keeping this admonition
in mind, what are the likely responses to Israeli muscle-flexing? For one,
it can ramp up the terrorist activities of Hizbullah and Hamas, neither
of which needs much incentive to go after Israelis; but how effective Hamas
would be depends in large part on the willingness of the Palestinian Authority
to clamp down on it. It could in addition drive Hizbullah to a new spate
of international terrorism. Alternatively, the Syrians could make trouble
for Israel indirectly, for example, by destabilizing Jordan, a specially
tempting target no doubt at this moment of transition with the young King
Abdallah II still feeling his way forward. The Iranian option seems problematic.
Tehran can do little more for Hizbullah than it already does; and significant
military support for Syria does not seem credible. The Iraqi card could
be more potent, for improvement in relations between the two countries
has been considerable -- and directly at the expense of Syrian relations
with the United States, as highlighted by the anti-American demonstrations
in Damascus after Operation Desert Fox, which led to an assault on the
U.S. embassy.[30] That said, it is not clear what impoverished and weakened
Iraq can to do help Syria that is worth the active hostility of Washington.
<p>More broadly, heightened tensions between Israel and Syria would quickly
translate into tensions between Israel and other Arab states, and with
Egypt and Jordan in particular. The Egyptians have already reacted strongly
to the signing of Turkish-Israeli agreements and could well see the two
states being engaged in an anti-Arab conspiracy.
<p><b><font size=+1>Israeli Constraints and Leverage</font></b>
<p>Israel would need to deploy an intensive diplomatic and information
effort to explain its position in the West, explaining that the American
policy favoring decisive action against states sponsoring terrorism means
not letting Syria continue to get away with its criminal actions. Syria
should not receive a prize for her occupying illegally Lebanon and using
its territory to wage a proxy terror war against Israel. As the State Department
itself has declared: “Terrorism of any sort is unacceptable and the international
communmust be committed to seeing that justice is done.”[31] Jerusal might
also note that Syria (and Hizbullah) has not yet paid for the killing of
American Marines anFrench troops in 1983 in Beirut, for assistance to Palestinian
groups sabotaging the peace process in 1995 and 1996, much less for the
1998 mob attacks against the American embassy in Damascus. Also, Israel
cannot accuse the Palestinian Authority of not stopping terrorism while
ignoring the Syrian abuses.
<p>The Israeli government will have also to take in consideration the mood
of its own public opinion, wary of the events in Lebanon and the difficult
and painful peace process with the Palestinians. It will have to convince
the Israeli people that the present situation is no more acceptable and
the achievement of the withdrawal from Lebanon and a fair and lasting peace
with Syria passes through a test of force with the Syrian regime, responsible
for the bloodshed and the impasse in the process.
<p>Most of the political and strategic factors that permitted the Turks
to prevail over Asad will probably also work for Israel:
<dir><font face="Symbol">&middot; A </font>beleaguered Syria, surrounded
by hostile countries, all the weaker after its crisis with Turkey.[32]
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>The decay of the Syrian military
in the years since the end of the U.S.S.R.: the Syrian military is nothing
like the kind of force it was in the 1980s.
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot;</font> Apprehensions in Damascus about
Turkish-Israeli coordination.
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>The weakening of Iran, Syria’s sole
strategic partner and the main sponsor of Hizbullah.
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>The acute and growing succession
issue in Syria that leaves Asad in need of stability to “enthrone” his
son Bashar.
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Asad may have nerves of steel but
his capitulation to Ankara shows that he knows when to retreat.</dir>
<b><font size=+1>In Favor of a New Policy</font></b>
<p>In all, a Turkish-style military option appears to be the last resort
to break the stalemate and bring about a change in Syrian policy if after
the elections Asad will stay fixed on his die-hard position. The time has
come for Israel not just to draw “red lines” in Lebanon but to stand by
them and conduct the negotiations from the position of strength it actually
enjoys. As Efraim Inbar has remarked, successive Israeli governments have
failed to realize what the Turkish government has proven: Syria is susceptible
to military pressure and this will not necessarily lead to a full-scale
war.[33]
<p>The new Israeli government elected in the May elections should clearly
and publicly express its desire to arrive rapidly to a full peace agreement
with Syria, which could include the total withdrawal from the Golan and
from South Lebanon, under conditions to be decided at the negotiation table.
Israel must not repeat the mistake of giving Syria a free hand to use terrorism
from Lebanon to reinforce its diplomatic position. The government should
declare (1) that Syria will be held responsible for any guerrilla or terrorist
activity against Israel in southern Lebanon and (2) that Damascus must
close all facilities on territory under its control used by groups that
use terror against Israel.[34] To prevent Syrian misunderstanding of Israeli
resolve, military activity in Lebanon should be accompanied by an alert
and the deployment of IDF troops to be ready for any escalation in Lebanon
or along the Golan front.
<p>If it does not suffice, and terrorist attacks continue, Israel must
be ready to use military force. Air attacks against Hizbullah and Palestinian
targets in Lebanon must follow, as well as their headquarters in the Beirut
area. Syrian intervention, or even an anti-aerial threat, should be accompanied
by the immediate destruction of its batteries (along the lines of the U.S.
and allied bombings in Iraq and Serbia). If this does not suffice, larger
scale air attacks against the Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon will have
to follow. Syria has vast strategic, political and economic stakes in Lebanon
and some 35,000 soldiers stationed there. Were Israel to attack and destroy
this presence, it would deal a critical blow to its power and regional
status. Clearly, Israel must also be ready for the possibility that Syria
will enlarge the conflict to the Golan and will threaten a full scale war,
in which case Israel should stand by its policy to the end.
<p>In all likelihood, the Turkish experience implies the threat of force
will be sufficient to win a favorable change in Damascus, without having
to resort to violence. Even a dovish Israeli political analyst who supports
the unilateral withdrawal, like Yoel Marcus, recognizes that Asad is less
composed than he appears. With a weak army whose equipment is antiquated,
Asad is in no hurry to plunge into a direct military confrontation with
Israel.[35] Therefore the probability of Syria going to war with Israel
over the clash on its continuous terrorist policy seems low.
<p>The Israeli government’s policy toward Syria has been extremely cautious
and conservative for almost three decades. It has not coped well with President
Asad’s skillful and immoral use of terrorism in Lebanon, a clever policy
that has caused Israel no end of heartache. It now has the right and the
duty to make use of every option, even the military one, to insure its
legitimate interests and its people’s security and welfare.

<p><b>MINUTES (Unofficial Translation)</b></center>

<p>In light of the messages conveyed on behalf of Syria by the President
of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E. Mr. Husni Mubarak and by the Iranian
Foreign Minister H.E. Mr. Kemal Harrazi on behalf of the Iranian President
H. E. Mr. Seyid Mohammed Khatemi and by the Foreign Minister of the Arab
Republic of Egypt, H.E. Mr. Amr Moussa, the Turkish. and Syrian delegations
whose names of which are listed in the attached list (Annex 1) have met
in Adana on 19 and 20 October 1998 to discuss the issue of cooperation
in fighting terrorism.
<p>In the meeting, the Turkish side repeated the Turkish demands presented
to the Egyptian President to eliminate the current tension in their relations.
Furthermore, the Turkish side brought to the attention of the Syrian the
reply that was received from Syria through the Arab Republic of Egypt,
which entails the following commitments:
<dir>
<dir>1. As of now, Ocalan is not in Syria and he will definitely not be
permitted to enter Syria.
<p>2. PKK elements abroad will not be permitted to enter Syria.
<p>3. As of now PKK camps are not operational and definitely will not be
permitted to become active.
<p>4. Many PKK members have been arrested and have been taken to court.
The lists are available, and Syria has delivered these lists to the Turkish
side.</dir>
</dir>
The Syrian side has confirmed the above mentioned points. Furthermore,
the parties have also agreed on the following points:
<dir>
<dir>1. Syria, on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, will not permit
any activity which emanates from its territory aimed at jeopardizing the
security and stability of Turkey. Syria will not allow the supply of weapons,
logistic material, financial support to, and propaganda activities of,
the PKK on its territory.
<p>2. Syria has recognized that the PKK is a terrorist organization. Syria
has, alongside other terrorist organizations, banned all activities of
the PKK and its affiliated organizations on its territories.

<p><b>Turkey’s Specific Demands from Syria</b></center>

<p>In order to normalize our relations, we expect Syria to comply with
the basic norms and principles of international relations. In this regard,
the following specific demands should be met:
<p>Given the fact that Turkish-Syrian relations were seriously damaged
by Syrian support for terrorism, we want Syria to accept formally its obligations
and renounce its previous stand on this matter. These obligations should
include a formal commitment not to give terrorists support, sanctuary,
and financial assistance. Syria should also prosecute PKK perpetrators
and extradite to Turkey the chief of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan and his collaborators.
<p>Within this framework, Syria should not:
<dir>
<dir><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Permit camps for terrorist training
to operate in territories under its control,
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Provide weapons, logistic materials
to the PKK,
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Provide fraud identification documents
to PKK members,
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Help terrorists in obtaining legal
passage and infiltration into Turkey,
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Permit the propaganda activities
of the terrorist organization,
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Allow the PKK to operate in accommodations
in its territory,
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Facilitate the passages of terrorists
from third countries (Europe, Greece, Southern Cyprus, Iran, Libya, Armenia)
to northern Iraq and Turkey.</dir>
</dir>
Syria should provide:
<dir>
<dir><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Cooperation in all activities
aimed at fighting terrorism.
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot; </font>Abstention from inciting other countries
which are members of the Arab League against Turkey.</dir>
</dir>
In light of the above, unless Syria refrains from these acts immediately,
with all the consequences, Turkey reserves the right to exercise her inherent
right of self-defense, and under all circumstances to demand just compensation
for the loss of life and property. Indeed, these views were transmitted
to Syria through diplomatic channels on 23 January 1996. However, our warnings
have fallen on deaf ears.
