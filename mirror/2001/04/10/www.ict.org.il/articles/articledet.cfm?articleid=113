<p><p><img SRC="../graphics/dagestan_w.gif" height=175 width=193 align=RIGHT>The
past weeks have witnessed an escalation of the situation in Chechnya, with
the start of a new phase of Islamist terrorism and guerrilla warfare through
two suicide operations. This marked the first time this <i>Modus Operandi</i>
was used in Chechnya by Islamist rebels.
<p><b>Suicide operations in Chechnya</b>
<br>On June 7<sup>th</sup> two suicide bombers—an unknown man and a young
Chechen Muslim woman by the name Hawaa’ Barayev—blew up a truck loaded
with explosives at a checkpoint on the grounds of the Omsk elite OMON (Russian
Special Forces) unit at Alkhan-Yurt in Chechnya.
<p>According to official Russian information agencies the operation caused
the death of two policemen, while five others were wounded. The truck crashed
through a perimeter fence and stopped outside a building where the elite
unit was housed. After the explosion, the building was fired at from a
nearby forest. This means that other rebels watched the suicide bombers,
and may hint at the possibility that the explosives were blown up by remote
control rather than by the suicide bombers themselves.
<p><b>“A message to the Muslims”</b>
<br>It should be noted that the official website of the rebels (<a href="http://www.qoqaz.net/">www.qoqaz.net</a>),
affiliated with the website of Osama bin Laden and his supporters (<a href="http://www.azzam.org/">www.azzam.org</a>)
claimed that the operation was carried out only by Barayev, and caused
the death of 27 Russian elite soldiers. Barayev was a cousin of Arbi Barayev,
one of the prominent rebel field commanders.
<p>The rebels noted that the operation was a message meant not only for
the Russians but “a message to the Muslims” as well. “It was a cry that
said no to the crimes against the Muslim Ummah, but will the people of
the Ummah heed to this call and rush to support their brothers and sisters
who are in need? Will the hearts of the believers come alive with this
example of pure faith and courageous sacrifice?”
<p>On June 11th a former Russian soldier, who converted to Islam and joined
the Islamist Chechen rebels, carried out another suicide operation at a
checkpoint in Khankala. The soldier, named by the Islamist rebels as Abdul
Rahman detonated a vehicle filled with explosives only a few minutes after
a federal convoy had passed through the checkpoint. The checkpoint itself
was destroyed and two OMON senior sergeants were killed in the operation.
<p>According to ITAR-TASS, the main Russian information agency, the driver
was named Sergey Dimitriyev, and upon his conversion to Islam he adopted
the name Jabrail. He was a fighter in the detachment of field commander
Mazman Akhmadov and came to Chechnya in early 1999, where he received military
training at “Khattab’s school of sabotage.” He set off the device when
asked to allow inspection of the car.
<p>On June 12<sup>th</sup> rebel forces in Grozny, the Chechen capital,
under the command of Ramadan Akhmadov, succeeded in planting explosives
in an army vehicle without the knowledge of the Russian soldier who drove
it. The vehicle blew up at an army position. An additional explosion occurred
on the first of June at an army base in Volgograd on June 1<sup>st</sup>.
<p>To date, as was the case with the explosions of civilian houses in Moscow
in September 1999, no one has taken responsibility for the attack. It seems
that the rebels are cautious not to admit any terrorist activity outside
of Chechnya, in order to preserve their image as guerrilla warriors and
freedom fighters rather than terrorists.
<p><b>Increasing emphasis on Islamist activity</b>
<br>According to the Russian government, on June 1<sup>st</sup> Aslan Maskhadov,
head of the Chechen rebels, held a meeting with his commanders in southern
Chechnya, and demanded that they intensify operations against the federal
troops all over Chechnya. Military sources reported that the number of
Islamist militants in Grozny has been growing lately. They claimed that
“people loyal to Khattab, the commander of the Arab Afghans in Chechnya,
who were taught the techniques of explosive operations and who were instructed
to stage terrorist and subversive acts in city arena, were sent to Grozny.”
<p>On 10 June ITAR-TASS reported that the Russian forces in Chechnya disposed
of 130 explosive devices in one day on June 8<sup>th</sup>. This is in
addition to about 10,300 previous devices found in Chechnya since the start
of the present anti-terrorist campaign on last August. In general, since
the beginning of June 2000, the Russian officials and information agencies
have placed more significance on the intense activity of the Islamist rebels.
It seems that this month the war in Chechnya entered a new phase, emphasized
by both the Russian authorities and the rebels.
<p>From the Russian point of view this escalation is a result of the much
more militant stand of the new president Vladimir Putin. Putin is currently
attempting to gain the approval of the US and Western-European countries
to launch wide-scale air attacks in Chechnya and Afghanistan. The Russians
are flooding the news agencies with information about the logistic support
given by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to the Chechen rebels. The Taliban
has thus created an “Islamist Internacional” on their soil, which is actively
backed by them and not only by their “honored guest,” Osama Bin Laden.
On June 15<sup>th</sup> in Berlin, President Putin declared that “an internacional
of terrorists, which is financed from abroad, is using Chechnya as a bridgehead
to attack Russia.” He asked for the “moral support” of Europe in combating
terrorists in the Caucasus.
<p>The Russian government daily <i>Rossiyskaya Gazeta</i> claimed on June
6<sup>th</sup> that several Russian banks had accused the French bank Credit
Agricole Indosuez of having “close links with Islamic fundamentalists in
Chechnya, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.” According to information from unofficial
Russian sources, the French bank was an “active participant in transferring
cash money to accounts of Al-Haramayn, an Islamic charitable organization
that gives financial assistance to Islamic extremists all over the world,
including Chechnya.” The French bank was claimed to be in contact also
with Chechen organized crime groups that attempted to damage Russian banks
and other economic interests.
<p>However the current escalation is probably also a result of the Islamists’
successes in the past year and the increasing Russian losses. According
to a report by the Russian non-government information agency Interfax from
8 June, since the start of the anti-terrorist operation in the Northern
Caucasus on August 2<sup>nd</sup> 1999, 2,357 Russian soldiers and policemen
were killed and 6,888 wounded. 278 of these were killed between August
2<sup>nd</sup> and September 30<sup>th</sup>, before the main offensive
in Chechnya itself. From October 1<sup>st</sup> 1999, to June 8<sup>th</sup>
2000, 2,079 were killed and 5,904 wounded. It should be noted therefore
that the proportion between killed and wounded security servicemen is 1:3,
a very high price in human losses when compared to other areas of violent
conflict in the world. The transfer of more elite and Special Forces to
Chechnya since October 1<sup>st </sup>seems to have had only a small affect
on the fight with the Islamist groups. During the above mentioned period,
638 of the killed and 1,858 of the wounded belonged to the Interior Ministry,
according to a statement of General Staff Col. General Valery Manilov quoted
by Interfax.
<p>In an article in the official daily <i>Rossiyskaya Gazeta</i> on June
1<sup>st</sup> 2000 Alexander Babakin analyzed the increasing terrorism
in Chechnya, and indirectly admitted the Russian’s difficulties in coping
with the Chechen Islamists. But the article quoted “specialists in this
field” that “the solution can only be to mount a comprehensive operation
with troops and special sub-units wiping out bandit groups in the mountains
and Special-Purpose police detachments, and the police catching them on
the plain and in cities and villages.”
<p>It would appear that the Russian government is trying to prepare their
own public opinion for the increase of its operations in Chechnya, and
to higher price in human losses. Thus far Russian public opinion plays no significant
role in affecting Russian activities, as it did in 1987-1989 with regard
to the Afghan conflict. However internal criticism in the Russian society
does exist. Between the lines of the claims of both sides, it seems that
the Russian forces really confront one important problem, which is heavy
difficulties in free movements and transportation in Chechnya.
<p><b>A new Russian policy in Chechnya</b>
<br>In addition to the preparation
of the Russian and international public opinion for the escalation of the
anti-terrorist campaign in Chechnya and may be Afghanistan, the Russian
President has also taken new administrative steps in Chechnya. On June
8<sup>th</sup> He issued a decree organizing a temporary system of bodies
of executive power in the Chechen Republic. The main steps were the administrating
of Chechnya directly from Moscow, and the appointment of the Chechen Mufti
Akhmed Kadyrov as head of the republic.
<p>Kadyrov served in 1994-1996 in the anti-Russian forces in Chechnya and
took part in military operations. But since the cease-fire in 1996 he supported
the peace with Russia, and expressed severe opposition to Maskhadov and
the Islamist extremists. Maskhadov declared Kadyrov as “the number one
enemy” and sentenced him to death. Upon his appointment he resigned from
his religious post, but gained the wide support of the local Islamic establishment.
The chairman of the Mufti Council of Russia Sheikh Ravil Gainutdin, stated
that “should the state permit, Kadyrov might head both the religious and
secular power in Chechnya.”
<p>The appointment of a distinguished religious figure who seems to enjoy
the wide support of the Chechen public seems to be an answer to the Islamic
claims of the rebels and their Islamist influence. Kadyrov was welcomed
by Daghestan too, since “he was the first to denounce the invasion of Basayev
and Khattab into Daghestan and called them enemies of Islam.” According
to a report by Interfax of June 15<sup>th</sup>, three of the rebels’ field
commanders have visited Kadyrov in recent days, in an attempt to open a
process of mediation. Kadyrov has also declared his intention to employ
former officials of the Maskhadov regime in his administration.
<p><b>Conclusions</b>
<br>The Russian Chechen policy under Putin seems to
be directed along two lines. On one hand, there is an attempt to reach
a peaceful solution in Chechnya by the establishment of a new administration
that will bring about a decline in the support of the Chechen public for
the Islamists. This is meant to lead to reconciliation with the Russians,
even though this new administration is directed by Putin from Moscow. On
the other hand, Putin seeks to redirect the fire toward Afghanistan and
the Taliban and gain international support for large-scale military operations
and air attacks against Afghanistan. By doing so, Putin actually admits
that there is no military solution to the Chechen issue or against the
Islamist rebels.
<p>On June 5-6<sup>th</sup>, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo
visited Israel and held talks on “the prospects for the cooperation in
struggle against international terrorism in general, and Islamist terrorism
in particular. He tried to persuade his Israeli counterparts that “the
problem of Chechen terrorism cannot be viewed as purely Russian,” but has
international aspects. The Israeli government is not keen to deal with
this problem in order not to open new Islamist fronts of terrorism against
Israeli or Jewish targets. Israel can also illustrate the drawbacks of
the military effort by pointing to its experience in Lebanon. There too,
military operations offered no true solution to the problem of terrorism.
