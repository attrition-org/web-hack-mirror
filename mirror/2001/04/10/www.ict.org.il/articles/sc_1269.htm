<br><i>What it Leaves Out</i></font></b></center>

<p><img SRC="../graphics/un_ct_w.gif" height=160 width=250 align=RIGHT>On
19 October, 1999 the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted
resolution No. 1269 (1999), condemning <i>“all acts, methods and practices
of terrorism as criminal and unjustified, regardless of their motivation.”</i><b>
</b>This resolution is an important step towards achieving real and effective
international cooperation against terrorism. It is a step in the right
direction, yet only a first step. It must be followed by a bid for an acceptable
international definition of terrorism.
<p><b>Terrorism is wrong, agreed. But what is terrorism?</b>
<p>There are a great number of resolutions calling upon the international
community to deepen and unify their efforts against international terrorism.
However, all of this is unfortunately no more than lip service. Without
reaching an acceptable international definition of the term “terrorism”
one can sign any declaration or agreement against terrorism without having
to fulfil ones obligations as per the agreement. For every country participatory
to the agreement will define the phenomenon of terrorism differently from
every other country. This lack of an internationally accepted definition
of terrorism reflects the hypocrisy in international politics as a whole
and in the case of counter terrorism as a case in point.
<p>When a violent act is aimed against a particular country, that country
will define the act as terrorism and the perpetrators terrorists. But when
the same act is aimed against another country, then the countries not affected
may refer to the perpetrators as guerillas, freedom fighters, an underground
movement or some other terms—terms with a more positive connotation than
the word “terrorist.”
<p>This situation is reflected in the well-known saying,<b> </b><i>“one
men’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”</i> This saying reflects
a misunderstanding and a misuse of the term “terrorism.” It implies that
the definition of terrorism is a matter of point of view and does not lend
itself to objective judgment. This cliche is founded on the will of the
perpetrators of violence to make a case that the same act will have a different
interpretation depending on ones attitudes to the end goal of the perpetrators.
It is just another way of saying, “The end justifies the means.”
<p><b>The quest for consensus</b>
<p>So the question still stands – What is terrorism? As mentioned above,
the Security Council resolution is one step in the right direction. Unfortunately
this is not enough. Now the council must reach an understanding on what
constitutes a terrorist act.
<p>It is clear that sometimes a non-state organization—a community, an
ethnic group or a religious sect—may have just grievances against a regime.
When a nation suffers from foreign occupation, or a society is controlled
by a ruthless dictatorship, or a regime commits crimes against humanity,
one can argue that the afflicted community has every right to use violence
against the state or regime.
<p>Almost every nation has at some time in its past used violence against
what it saw as an evil regime. But the question is—even in case of a just
cause is every use of violence justified? Or are there certain types of
violence that should always be forbidden?
<p>The next step that the Security Council must take is to declare unequivocally
that even in case of a just cause—a cause in which the use of violence
may be considered justified, one type of violence in never justified. This
is <i>the intentional use of violence against civilians</i>. Or in other
words, “terrorism,” defined as <i>“the deliberate use of violence against
civilians in order to achieve political aims.”</i><b> </b>This type of
violence is always unacceptable even when used in the most righteous of
causes (see <a href="define.htm">“Defining Terrorism”</a>).
<p>Only when all states agree on what type of acts constitute terrorism,
can resolutions such as this latest one have any real effect on the international
arena. Such a consensus is not impossible. A precedent already exists in
the parallel definition of the term “war crime,” defined as the intentional
targeting of civilians by military personnel. It is this international
agreement on the definition of the act that alone makes possible international
extradition, prosecution and punishment of individuals who perpetrate such
acts.
<p><b>The end does not justify the means, period</b>
<p>The significance of the Security Council resolution is its insistence
that when dealing with terrorism there is no taking into account the motivations
of the perpetrators.<i> In the case of terrorism the end does not justify
the means.</i>
<p>One can not justify atrocities by saying I am not a terrorist because
I am a freedom fighter. The answer in that case would be: maybe you are
a freedom fighter but if you are using violence against civilians then
you are most certainly a terrorist as well.
<p>One of the great ironies in this latest Security Council action is that the draft 
of resolution 1269
was proposed by none other than Russia--the very country that once
(in its communist phase) defended nearly every major terrorist organization
in the world. In fact, Russian support for a number of such organizations was
based on the justification that their just cause excused any and all acts.
But when these experts in the use of the phrase “freedom fighters; not terrorists” 
came under attack by such groups
themselves, they quickly saw the need to draw a clear line between 
terrorism and other types of violence. 

<P>Those states that have seen their
daily life disrupted by brutal attacks on civilians can see most clearly
that the use of terrorism cannot be legitimized by any cause—no matter
how just.
