<p><br><i>This article focuses on Islamic terrorism in the framework of overall
Islamic activity in Turkey. It argues that Islamic terrorist organizations
active in Turkey during the 1990s strove to establish an Islamic Sharia’-based
state on the&nbsp;<img SRC="../graphics/mosque_w.gif" height=201 width=125 align=RIGHT>Iranian
example. They profited from deeper social and political trends in Turkish
society, while at the same time strengthening these trends by their violence.
These groups enjoyed wide Iranian support and often acted on behalf of
Iranian local and regional, political and strategic interests. The reaction
of Turkish authorities in the past to Islamic terrorist activity was limited
and thus encouraged leaders of these groups and their sponsors to continue
escalating violence hoping to bring down the secular democratic regime
in Turkey. Since 1996 the military and civilian secular establishment have
acted vigorously not only against the violent of-shoots of the Islamist
movement, but also against its political representatives, thus abating
seriously the power and influence acquired by it in the 80s and 90s.</i>
<br>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="90%">
<br>It has been argued that the marginality of violent Islamist groups
in Turkey in contrast to the vigorous armed opposition in Egypt or Algeria
is due to the Turkish political system’s pluralism and the RP’s full integration
into this system.[1] But the leaders and sponsors of these extremist organizations
think that by violence against the secular symbols of the Turkish state,
leading secular intellectuals and journalists, and representatives of “Imperialism
and Zionism,” they will indeed help install an Islamic state. The limited
reaction by the authorities up to 1996 and the RP’s electoral victories
seemed to provide reasons for this hope.
<p><b>Political and Strategic Background</b>
<br>The military coup of 1980 was intended to end a long period of widespread
terrorism and violence throughout the country perpetrated by extremist
left-wing and right-wing organizations, and also to hold back the threat
of radical Islam embodied in the National Salvation Party led by Necmettin
Erbakan.[2] But while military rule between 1980-1983 did break up the
extreme left and right, the Islamic movement survived and even grew in
importance during the 1980s.[3] In a marked contrast to the first two military
coups, in 1980 military authorities proclaimed the importance of religion
in the political life of the nation.[4]
<p>A new ideological concept was developed by a group of right-wing intellectuals
(Intellectuals’ Hearth - <i>Aidinlar Ocagi</i>) and adopted by the military,
“The Turkish-Islamic Synthesis” which, on its pragmatic side, represented
an attempt to integrate Islamists and the nationalists.[5] The main idea
was that the Islamist influence in the system would contribute to the territorial
integrity of the Turkish nation-state and counter revolutionary sentiments,
especially among Kurdish youth. The Islamists offered an attractive alternative
even for ex-communists after the collapse of communism in the Soviet bloc.[6]
<p>On the foreign front, the Turkish-Islamic synthesis was supposed to
help contain Soviet expansion southward and to combat the radical Iranian
brand of Islam by constructing a coalition of U.S.-backed moderate Islamic
states. This policy favored closer relations with Saudi Arabia to gain
big loans for the needy Turkish economy.[7] The Cold War’s end, USSR’s
disintegration, the birth of new republics mostly inhabited by peoples
of Turk origin, the Gulf war’s result and the Bosnian crisis created at
the beginning of the 1990s a new international environment which put Turkey
in a key position, sometimes in direct competition with Iran for regional
strategic influence and economic assets.[8] Nevertheless, that strategy
let the Islamic genie out of Ataturk’s bottle, as one researcher put it.[9]
<p><b>The History of the “Islamic Movement” in Turkey.[10]</b>
<br>Islamic subversive and terrorist activity in Turkey began in the 1960s.
As early as 1967 and 1973 the leaders of <i>Hizb</i> <i>ut-Tahrir</i> (Islamic
Liberation Party) were imprisoned for attempting “to bring the Islamic
State Constitution to Turkey”.[11] Islamic Jihad appeared as a real terrorist
threat in the 1980s, after a series of assassinations of Jordanian, Saudi
and Iraqi diplomats. In October 1991 Islamic Jihad took responsibility
for killing an American sergeant and wounding an Egyptian diplomat to protest
the Middle East peace conference in Madrid.[12] For many years it was assumed
that this group was a Lebanese Shiite terrorist organization, until it
was discovered that a Turkish branch existed, engaging in assassinations
of secular intellectuals.
<p>As Anat Lapidot correctly notes, defining the Islamic movement is a
complex task, since the term is applied to different organizations, with
their own ideas and strategies, seeking to establish an Islamic state and
society. Citing Sabri Sayari, she distinguishes between traditionalists
and radicals, the latter being a minority inspired by the Iranian revolution.[13]
<p>Ismet Imset points to the confusion about these different groups among
the general public, researchers, and government circles in Turkey. A report
by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and the Security
General Directorate of the Police in October 1991 mentioned no less than
ten Islamic organizations active in Turkey: Turkish Islamic Liberation
Army (IKO), Turkish Islamic Liberation Front (TIK-C), Fighters of the Islamic
Revolution (IDAM), Turkish Islamic Liberation Union (TIKB), World Sharia
Liberation Army (DSKO), Universal Brotherhood Front-Sharia Revenge Squad
(EKC-SIM), Islamic Liberation party Front (IKP-C), Turkish Fighters of
the Universal Islamic War of Liberation (EIK-TM), Turkish Islamic Fighters
Army (IMO) and Turkish Sharia Revenge Commandos (TSIK).[14]
<p>In this article, Islamic movement is the term used to describe all the
currents in Turkish Islam while Islamic Movement refers to one of the main
radical groups.
<p>Imset makes a distinction between western and southeast Turkey. In the
West the Islamic Movement (<i>Islami Hareket</i>), called also Islamic
Resistance (<i>Islami Direnis</i>), is considered to represent the ideological
influence of the original (Iranian) Hezbollah.[15] Both Movement and Resistance
were only temporary code names, at least until 1990. In southeast Turkey
the movement spread first under the name of Hezbollah, then was referred
as the Hezbol-contra, to address its anti-PKK activity. According to Imset,
Hezbollah and Islamic Movement are in fact one, representing an umbrella
organization of groups acting on behalf of what he calls “The International
Islamic Movement.”[16]
<p>At the end of the 1970s, under the influence of the coalition between
left-wing organizations and Khomeini`s followers in Iran, an alliance of
the left, especially Maoists, with radical Islamic elements was established
in Turkey and together they attacked the nationalist right. The conflict
peaked in February 1979 when a young Muslim leader was killed by nationalists
(known as “Idealists”) in the yard of the Fatih mosque in Istanbul.
<p>The Turkish Islamic Movement, like all other radical organizations,
received a serious blow during the September 1980 military coup. But, as
the regime encouraged the general Islamic trend as a solution to political
polarization, and as both Marxists and nationalists lost their influence,
Islamic activists were afforded ample space to strengthen their position.
The “Hezbollah Muslims” appeared for the first time publicly in 1984 and,
as the original Hezbollah, proclaimed support for the Iranian revolution
and the defense not of nations or sects, but of “Allah’s way.”
<p>According to Imset, Kalim Siddiqui, a Pakistani active at the Muslim
Institute in London, had a key role in unifying Turkey`s radical Islamic
Movemen. Thus, the first Hezbollahi appeared in Turkey as the “followers
of Siddiki” (sic).[17] A pro-Hezbollah magazine published in November 1987
“The guidelines of the Islamic Movement,” which included the acceptance
of the Islamic State as the center of religious belief, the leadership
of Muslim scholars, the spread of the mentality of martyrdom and the leadership
of the Islamic revolution [in Iran].[18]
<p>A significant development occurred in the middle of the 1980s, with
the conversion of some members of the right-wing Nationalist Movement (MHP)
to Islam. The death of one of their leaders in prison in 1984 and the tortures
suffered by many others convinced a group of extreme nationalist activists
“to turn to Allah” and condemn the “darkness of nationalism.”[19] They
were heavily influenced by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, but later concluded
that Sayyd Kutub’s death forced the Egyptian Islamists into a nationalist
position and that true Islam could not tolerate nationalism. These militants
were already professionals in the field of terrorism and street fighting
and represented a significant operational support for the Islamic Movement.
<p>In southeast Turkey, Islamic radicalism emerged in poor towns and villages
with a large Kurdish population (Dyarbakir, Silvan, Cizre, Kiziltepe and
others), especially among the young and unemployed. They followed the teachings
of local Muslim scholars or sheiks and often organized themselves around
extremist Islamic publications such as <i>Tevhid</i>, <i>Yeryuzu</i> and
<i>Objektif</i>.
Their activity became more visible at the beginning of the 1990s, influenced
more and more by Khomeini`s teachings, and they were identified by the
local public as Hezbollah, although they considered themselves as belonging
to the Islamic Movement.
<p><b>The ideology of the Turkish Islamic Movement</b>
<br>There are few sources for research on the Turkish Islamic organizations,
although they have their own publications and manifestoes distributed quite
freely even when they threaten future victims of terrorist attacks. All
the material is in Turkish and has neither been collected nor translated.
The only other source consists of interviews given by anonymous leaders
and activists to Turkish journalists.
<p>In one such interviews, published in February 1993, a militant declared:
“We are fighters of the Islamic Liberation Movement, the sword against
Satan, blasphemy, Zionism and Imperialism. We have begun taking action
only recently in Turkey and our move is based on pain, suffering and patience.
We do not pursue a tribal case; our objective is to establish a state for
the Muslims.” Asked whether he belonged to Hezbollah, the militant replied
that the press gave that name to the organization and that they will adopt
it only when the movement will be worthy of it. Meanwhile it has not reached
“that level of perfection”[20]
<p>In speaking about the special relationship of the Movement with Iran,
the same militant seemed careful not to confirm “the lies of the Turkish
state” about such links. Iran is seen as an example and a guide but the
instructions are “from the Koran” and not from Iran, “the land of Dar-ul
Islam where blasphemy has been crushed.” The Movement needs no instructions
from any country because the Koran is the program and shows the strategies
and the tactics to be adopted.[21]
<p>It seems that the Sunni origin of the radical Turkish Islamic groups
did not prevent their close cooperation with the Iranian Shi’a regime.
The material published so far in the Turkish sources does not permit to
evaluate the exact nature of these groups’ ideology: declarations as those
cited above are general and not binding. Yet, it is known that various
Sunni extremist organizations have viewed the Iranian revolution and its
leader Khomeini as a catalyst and a model for their own revolutionary endeavor.
This is the case of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and its leader
Fathi al-Shqaqi[22] or the Algerian Groupe Islamique Arme (GIA),[23] who
too received direct Iranian logistic and financial support. The Algerian
government even broke diplomatic relations with Iran on this ground.
<p>For its part, the Iranian regime, in spite of its increasing nationalism
since the war with Irak, has been keen to convince the Sunni movements
that it continued to stick to Khomeini’s Islamic universalistic ideology.
Khameneh’i, Iran’s spiritual leader, declared that his country wanted the
unity of all Muslim brothers [Sunni and Shi’i], unity focusing on what
all Muslims have in common - the Prophet, the Qur’an and the struggle against
common enemies.[24]
<p>A report prepared by the Turkish security authorities for the National
Security Council at the beginning of 1997 outlined the objectives of the
radical religious movements and stressed that their strategy consists of
three stages.[25]
<p>The first stage is the message (<i>teblig</i>), and calls for an effort
by the radicals to persuade the people to adopt the Islamic religion, establish
an Islamic state and administration, live in accordance with Islamic rules
and struggle to safeguard the Islamic way of life.
<p>The second stage is the community (<i>cemaat</i>) and calls for the
restructuring of communities in accordance with the requirements of the
first stage.
<p>The third stage is the struggle (<i>jihad</i>) and calls for the armed
struggle to safeguard the Islamic way of life.
<p>Special mention should be made of a strange organization called The
Great Eastern Islamic Fighters Front (IBDA-C), active since the middle
of the 1970s but more extremist and aggressive since the beginning of the
1990s. Although an Islamic movement struggling for the constitution of
an Islamic state, it uses leftist slogans in its publications and accepts
ex-Marxists in its ranks. It is also extremely antisemitic and anti-Christian
in its propaganda and terrorist activity as well. It is interesting to
note that IBDA-C’s publications do not show any particular pro-Iranian
tendency.
<p><b>Enemies and Strategic Objectives</b>
<br>A chronological analysis of terrorist activity of Islamic groups shows
that 1990 was probably the starting point for their offensive against the
Turkish secular establishment: a professor, journalist, political scientist
and writer were assassinated by Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Operation
(or Action), the first time this name was used. Muammar Aksoy, a liberal
political scientist, was also killed in 1990 and then for the first time
the name Islamic Movement appeared.[27]
<p>During 1991, the year of the Gulf War, Islamic radicals seemed to enter
a period of reassessment, which ended after the opening of the Madrid peace
talks between Arab countries and Israel. In October an American soldier
was killed and an Egyptian diplomat wounded by Islamic Jihad.[28] The year
1992 represented the turning point in radical Islamic terrorist activity,
as the objectives attacked during this year being from exiled Iranian opposition
as well as Jews and Israelis.[29]
<p>But the government, security authorities, public and even the press
became really aware of and shocked by the Islamic terrorist threat when
Ugur Mumcu, one of Turkey’s top investigative reporters—who had covered
the PKK, the rise of Islamic radicalism, and drug smuggling networks—was
killed on 24 January 1993 by a car-bomb similar to that used in the assassination
of an American computer specialist in October 1991 and an Israeli diplomat
in March 1992. Both the Islamic Liberation Organization and IBDA-C took
responsibility for the murder.[30]
<p>Several days later an attempt was made on the life of a well-known Turkish
businessman and community leader of Jewish origin, Jak Kamhi, by a group
of four terrorists who used automatic weapons and even a rocket-launcher.
He escaped uninjured. The same month the tortured body of an exiled Iranian
dissident—Abbas Gholizadeh, a former officer and the Shah’s bodyguard -
kidnapped several weeks before, was discovered by the police.
<p>This series of terrorist events provoked a sharp reaction from Turkish
public opinion: huge street demonstrations in favor of the secular regime,
a strong press campaign, and swift action by security authorities against
the perpetrators and their sponsors. the first time the Islamic Action
or Movement and Iran were directly accused of and implicated in acts of
terror against the state. The arrests and interrogations of many Turkish
members of these organizations unveiled the story behind the killings of
Turkish secular intellectuals and anti-Khomeini Iranian exiles in the years
1990 - 1992.[31]
<p>But the arrest and trial of dozens of Islamic terrorists did not dissuade
more extremists from continuing to attack Turkish intellectuals fighting
for the secular state and values. In July 1993 they set on fire a hotel
where a cultural festival was taking place and 37 intellectuals were burned
to death.[32] Aziz Nesin, one of Turkey’s leading literary figures, was
the main individual target of the fundamentalists. He was accused of intending
to publish Salman Rushdie’s “Satanic Verses.” The trial against the suspects
of the massacre involved only 20 participants of a much bigger group of
those responsible.[33]
<p>The fight of the security authorities against the radicals continued
during 1994, when 659 members of Hizbullah were caught, some of them responsible
for murders of activists in exiled Iranian opposition groups. In January,
four members of the Islamic Movement in Istanbul were arrested for their
part in the killing of a Mojahedin-e Khalq activist, the Shah’s ex-bodyguard
and a member of the Kurdish opposition, KDPI. In October, a six-man Hezbollah
team was arrested while preparing to assassinate, on orders from Iranian
intelligence, a woman of Armenian descent guilty of employing “only” Muslim
women in her brothel! They were also involved in the assassination of Iranian
dissidents.[34]
<p>This same year IBDA-C was responsible for 90 terrorist incidents, including
five bombings in various cities.[35] A prominent cinema critic and writer,
Onat Kutlar, was killed in December by a bomb attack carried by IBDA-C
aimed “at spoiling the colonialist Noel [Christmas] celebrations.”[36]
<p>In 1995, attacks continued. IBDA-C may have been responsible for a bomb
attack in January on the building of the Ataturk Association and the attempted
assassination in June of a prominent Jewish community leader in Ankara.[37]
<p>One of the most controversial terrorist activities of Hezbollah in southeast
Turkey has been the liquidation of dozens of pro-PKK activists, journalists,
intellectuals and politicians beginning in the fall of 1991 and throughout
1992 and 1993. It has been widely assumed that this was the work of some
splinter group. The amount of immunity it enjoyed from the security authorities
due to its anti-PKK nature, earned it the name “Hezbol-contra.”[38]
<p>It must be stressed that its members were mostly of Kurdish origin.
The Hizbullah regarded the PKK as Islam’s enemy and has accused it of “trying
to create an atheist community, supporting the communist system, trying
to divide the people through chauvinist activities and directing pressure
on the Muslim people.”[39] An interviewed Hizbullah militant in the southeast
described the goal of his organization as the establishment of an “ Islamic
Kurdish state in Turkey.”[40]
<p>In March 1993 the PKK signed a “cooperation protocol” with the “Hezbollah
Kurdish Revolutionary Party” aimed at ending the conflict and finding “methods
for a joint struggle against the Turkish state.” The agreement was achieved
after Hezbollah has recognized that “the colonialists” have exploited it
and that the clashes in no way benefited the cause of Islam.[41]
<p>A turning point in the Turkish authorities’ attitude toward the Islamic
terrorist threat occurred in March 1996, with the arrest of one of the
leaders of Islamic Action, Irfan Cagarici, and his confessions about the
role his organization has played since the early 1990s in the assassination
of secular politicians and intellectuals, with direct support and supervision
of Iranian intelligence.[42]
<p>The relations between Turkey and Iran reached a new low as a result.
But then, in June 1996, the RP achieved power in an alliance with the center-right
True Path Party (DYP) in the first Islamic government in 73 years of secular
Kemalist regimes, with Erbakan as prime minister.[43]
<p><b>Islam’s Growing Political Power and the Problem of Terrorism</b>
<br>The “Turkish-Islamist Synthesis” was a strategy adopted by the political
and military establishment at the beginning of the 1980s to counter revolutionary
sentiments - especially among Kurdish youth - with the traditional conservatism
of tribal leaders and Islamic scholars. The increase in the influence of
Islam seemed a modest price to pay for the territorial integrity of the
Turkish state.[44]
<p>Turgut Ozal, the first Prime Minister of a civilian government after
1983, himself had strong connections to the Nakshibandi religious order.
He pushed for a relaxation of Kemalist and secularist policies and a public
admission of Islam as an essential component of Turkish identity. During
the long period of his rule as Prime Minister and then president of Turkey,
Muslim associations, foundations, publications, television and radio stations,
flourished and spread the message of Islam. Islamists built strongholds
in the Ministry of Education.[45]
<p>The important role played by Islamic radical publications in the recruitment
and indoctrination of militants and the designation of objectives to be
attacked, cannot be underestimated: Two printing houses, the Istanbul-based
<i>Akademi</i>
and <i>Objektif</i>, and the monthlies <i>Yeryuzu</i> and
<i>Tehvid</i>
have been accused of being behind Hezbollah.[46]
<p>IBDA-C sent death threats to the head of the Jewish community in Ankara
before a bomb was placed in his car, and published a list of Jewish targets
in the extreme religious periodical <i>Akinci</i> <i>Yolu</i>.[47] IBDA-C’s
weekly, <i>Taraf</i>, took responsibility for the bomb attack on the film
critic Onat Kutlar in December 1994 and sent “a warning not to play with
fire” to TV journalist Ali Kirca, whom it accused of being “anti-Islam.”[48]
<p>In this atmosphere, pro-Islamic politicians received important appointments
in the sensitive field of security, such as the Ministry of Interior. This
happened even before the 1980 coup, while it was under the control of Erbakan’s
National Salvation party. Under the interior minister at the end of the
1980s, Abdulkadir Aksu, the security apparatus - especially the intelligence
and personnel departments - was penetrated by pro-Islamic elements and
the slightest resistance to fundamentalism was broken. According to Ismet
Imset, during this period there was a general inclination in the Ministry
towards the “Saudi and even Iranian Islamism.” At the end of 1991, Aksu
was replaced as minister and an extensive purge was launched in the ranks
of the Police to rid it of fundamentalist officers.[49] According to Zubaida,
700 of the 1,600 key ministry executives, provincial governors and other
functionaries were believed to be RP supporters. Even in April 1994 they
permitted the waging of unauthorized mass Islamist demonstrations in Ankara
and Istanbul.[50] Ironically, they were reassigned to posts in the southeast
where they supported or ignored the attacks of Hezbollah against the PKK.
<p>The attitude of the Refah party’s leadership regarding the violence
and terror on the radical fringes of the Islamic movement is at least ambiguous,
if not clearly supportive. Erbakan condemned the violence used in the assassination
of journalist Mumcu in March 1993 and declared that it is incompatible
with the values of true Islam. But at the same time important members of
his party accused Israel for killing him.[51] In November 1993, Erbakan
said at his party’s parliamentary meeting that only “Islamic fraternity”
could combat the PKK, but he did not mention the terrorism of the Islamic
groups at all.[52] Some researchers have even considered Hizbullah as the
RP’s armed protector.[53]
<p>Despite all the evidence, as late as the end of 1995 the leading Islamic
circles denied even the existence of fundamentalist terrorist organizations.
The deputy RP leader, Abdullah Gul, declared that no terror movement is
compatible with Islam and that the accusation is “being circulated intentionally
before the elections” in order to ithem. According to another leader, most
of the crimes in Turkey blamed on the Islamic movement are in fact “international
operations” and “plots of the West” against Turkey.[54]
<p>Erbakan’s real policy toward the Islamic terrorist groups can be judged
by the hosting of representatives of Palestinian Hamas, Egypt’s Muslim
Brothers and Algeria’s FIS at RP’s political convention after his ascent
to the premiership. Erbakan was not even impressed by President Mubarak’s
protest against the invitation of Egyptian Muslim Brothers to the party
congress, which sparked a diplomatic incident with Egypt. Over the years,
Erbakan maintained a strange silence about the complicity of neighboring
Muslim countries in anti-Turkish terrorism.[55]
<p><b>“The Iranian Connection” and Turkey’s Reaction</b>
<br>Iran’s policy of supporting and inciting Islamic terrorist activity
in Turkey in the early 1990s can be understood as its drive to export the
Islamic revolution to a key Muslim country, symbol of secularism and a
strategic adversary. Its evaluation of the complex Turkish internal situation
and the Islamic trend’s growing influence probably played an important
role in the decision to pursue such an aggressive policy. According to
this evaluation, the emergence of Turgut Ozal as leader of Turkey in the
1980s caused a gradual change in the relations between the two countries
because he succeeded in reducing the sense of opposition to Islam among
the political elite in Turkey, pursued a policy which included attention
to Islam and expansion of good relations with its Muslim neighbors. Islamic
Iran looked at Ozal’s policy on the whole positively and encouraged its
continuation.[56]
<p>The Gulf War, the defeat of Ozal’s Motherland Party in the elections
of early 1990s, stronger critical views of Islamic Iran among the Turkish
authorities, and the increasing press attacks against Iran, weakened Ozal’s
“legacy” after his death. Hostility toward Iran reached its peak when a
Turkish minister openly accused Iran of “creating insecurity” inside Turkey.
Some border violations occurred and the Ankara authorities were reluctant
to curtail the activities of Iranian “counterrevolutionary groups” on its
territory. Ironically, Iran considered that its “excessively moderate and
reactive behavior” produced the escalation of Ankara’s “unfriendly approaches”.
<p>But the failure of secular power circles to get closer to Europe and
the United States as a solution for Turkey’s economic problems, the growth
of Islamism resulting in the RP’s victory and Erbakan’s premiership, and
Turkey’s need for Iran’s support to solve some regional problems, caused
a decline in tension between the two countries. According to the Iranian
evaluation, President Suleyman Demirel’s inclination to “combine Islam
with the particular conditions of Turkey and the more Islamic viewpoints
of Premier Erbakan” made possible the improvement of the relations.[57]
<p>It is quite obvious that there was deep Iranian involvement in the terrorist
activities waged by Islamic groups and organizations in Turkey. In several
of the most important and sensitive cases of terrorism, this interference
in Turkish internal political life was proved in court. In other cases
there was ample intelligence information transmitted or leaked to the press
by the security authorities. The Turkish Islamic militants indicted for
the murder of Mumcu and an Iranian dissident in 1993, and two of those
accused of murdering three intellectuals in 1990 and a Jewish businessman
in 1993, were connected with Iranian agents, among them diplomats stationed
in Turkey. They received military training in Iran, on “pursuit, counter-pursuit,
weapons and bombs.”[58] The Iranians began their propaganda and indoctrination
work through the numerous Cultural Centers they opened in Turkey. There
they recruited sympathizers of Khomeini’s doctrine ready to work for their
interests and sent them to Iran for training.[59]
<p>As noted previously, an abrupt change occurred in the Turkish authorities’
attitude after Mumcu’s killing. It was only when the murders got out of
hand and under growing international criticism that Ankara acknowledged
that the Turkish Hizbullah truly existed.[60]
<p>For the first time, a Turkish minister of interior declared at a press
conference that members of radical Islamic organizations underwent months
of military and theoretical training in Iranian security installations,
traveled with Iranian real and forged documents, had weapons and explosives
of Iranian origin and participated in attacks on Turkish citizens and also
Iranian opposition militants.[61] In spite of these grave revelations,
the overall political approach towards Iran was very cautious. The minister
of interior concluded that Iran as a state was not behind these actions,
that it had no interest in such murders in Turkey, but, however, “the perpetrators
had connections in Iran.”
<p>A detailed account of the “Iranian Connection” in these cases and the
official Turkish ambiguous position was given by Imset.[63] President Ozal
remarked that “foreign forces” may be behind provocative incidents and
may have supporters in Turkey, without naming them.[64] Prime Minister
[at that time] Demirel called for a “coolheaded” approach to the Iranian
link in order not to disrupt bilateral relations unnecessarily. He expressed
the belief that the Iranian state was not involved in the murders and that
it would cooperate on the issue with the Turkish authorities.[65]
<p>Although Iranian officials denied any involvement in aiding or training
Turkish terrorist organizations, the Iranian Foreign Minister, Velayati,
had a more subtle reaction. In an interview to Turkish television he excluded
even the possibility that any anti-Turkish activity can be conducted on
Iran’s territory and escape the Iranian state’s control. He denied that
Iran geared activities or movements against Turkey but at the same time
he accused the Turkish government of supporting, directly or indirectly,
terrorist groups opposed to the regime in Iran. He proposed to discuss
these “mutual allegations” in the framework of the common security committee.
He vaguely denied any ties with anti-secular circles in Turkey but added
that if there were groups in Turkey that liked the Iranian model and were
inspired by its values, it could not be argued that Iran has created them.
A Turkish political commentator noted that Velayati’s general behavior
during the interview strengthened the conviction that Tehran supports acts
of terrorism by radical Turkish supporters and wanted to use Mumcu’s murder
to bargain with Turkey.[66]
<p>Turkey has indeed given humanitarian shelter to more than a million
Iranians, many of them political refugees from Khomeini’s regime. In fact,
Iran has never presented any evidence of Turkey’s alleged involvement in
terrorist activities on its territory. It is known that since the end of
the Gulf War, the main opposition violent organization, Mujahedin-e Khalq,
has not mounted terrorist operations in Iran, apart from occasional cross-border
operations by its “National Liberation Army” from Iraqi soil and with Iraqi
assistance.[67]
<p>Relations between Turkey and Iran in the following years continued to
be strained, with persistent ups and downs. But the main matter of conflict
was now the issue of Iran’s support to the PKK. The PKK intensified its
terrorist activity in 1994 and began a campaign of international terrorism
inside and outside Turkey, while Iran offered a safe-haven to the PKK fighters.[68]
<p>The Iranian relative inactivity on the radical Islamic front was probably
also due to the successful operations waged by the Turkish security forces
against the Islamic groups and the consequent decline in their terrorist
activities in 1994 and 1995, compared with 1993. Radical Islamist organizations
staged 86 acts of violence in 1995, compared with 464 attacks in 1994.
A total of 25 persons died and 21 were wounded in these attacks, staged
mainly by Hizbullah and IBDA-C. “<i>Ilim</i>,” one of Hizbullah’s two splinter
groups (<i>Ilim</i> and <i>Menzil</i>) stopped most of its armed activity,
many cadre of the Islamic Movement were arrested and IC retained its level
of activity mostly by acts of bombing and arson.[69]
<p>The assassination in February 1996 in Istanbul of two leading Iranian
opposition activists and the arrest in March 1996 of the Islamic Action
leader, Irfan Cagarici, and his revelations about the “Iranian Connection”
again sparked the political and diplomatic dispute between the two governments.
But the accusations were related mainly to the old known terrorist attacks
of 1990-1993 and did not seriously affect bilateral relations.
<p>But then in June 1996 the Islamic-lead coalition came to power in Turkey
and Erbakan embarked upon an enthusiastic effort to improve relations with
Iran.[70] He visited Libya and Iran immediately after his nomination and
signed an agreement with Iran for the supply of natural gas for the amount
of 23 billion dollars. On the internal arena Erbakan tried to advance,
very cautiously, some fundamentalist reforms, lifting the ban on headscarves
for women in government offices and encouraging the attendance of religious
schools.
<p><b>An Islamic Scheme?</b>
<br>Most scholars agree that although Turkish Islam shares many common
features with other Middle East Islamic fundamentalist movements, it has
grown and developed in a very different political and social environment
shaping its unique nature. As Sami Zubaida points out, Turkey’s Islamist
ideology is tied up with Turkish nationalism in an unique fashion and challenges
the secularist components and European identification of Kemalism, the
dominant and official form of Turkish nationalism. At the same time the
RP, the Islamic movement’s leading political force, has integrated fully
in the Turkish pluralist system. This may account, according to Zubaida,
for the marginality of the violent Islamic groups.[71]
<p>Was the RP a legitimate democratic party that unconditionally supported
the existing secular order, or did it use the pluralist system and democratic
methods only as a means toward its ultimate goal of installing an Islamic
<i>sharia’</i>-based
state in Turkey. RP’s ambiguous and tortuous policy over the issue of Islamic
terrorism in Turkey and Iranian involvement in it during the years 1990-1996
casts some doubts about its genuine acceptance of the democratic values
and the secular regime. What probably most influenced the RP’s moderate
and cautious policies over the years has been the need to take in account
the Turkish army’s firmness in defending the Kemalist secular regime and
to avoid a direct clash with its secular nationalist core.
<p>This also seems to have been the strategy of the more violent, terrorist
groups of the Islamic movement. The Islamic terrorist groups never attacked
military or security personnel, although many of their members were killed
during the security forces’ anti-terrorist campaigns. Only low-level local,
mostly Kurdish, politicians have been killed by these organizations but
no top secular politicians. This contrast with Egypt or Algeria, where
high-ranking military and police personnel or politicians involved in the
fight against the Islamic organizations have been one of their preferred
targets.[72] Moreover, Turkish Islamic groups have not attacked Western
targets or acted abroad, like other Islamic groups or the PKK, though they
have some infrastructure in Europe.[73]
<p>The main targets attacked have been secular intellectuals and media
professionals, so important in defending secular values and shaping public
opinion’s views against the Islamic movement. The elimination of these
personalities profited all streams in the Islamic movement and did not
seem to provoke a strong reaction against terrorist groups and their political
mentors, at least until the assassination of Mumcu. Islamic groups attacked
and threatened Jewish personalities, the Jewish community and probably
also Israeli diplomats. By these actions they implemented the anti-Jewish,
anti-Zionist aspect of the extremist Islamic ideology. In this they were
not different from RP, which expressed antisemitic and anti-Israeli views
in its propaganda, its official economic platform, and accused Israel for
murderous attacks against secular personalities perpetrated by the Islamists
themselves.[74]
<p>It can thus be hypothesized that even if there was no structural or
formal connection between the Islamic movement’s political and violent
streams, there was an objective ideological alliance and a <i>de</i> <i>facto</i>
cooperation between them toward achieving the goal of establishing a Turkish
Islamic state. It is quite clear that the RP leaders tried to cover up
the radicals’ violent practices but there is no published evidence about
the Islamic terrorist organizations’ attitude toward the RP’s role in advancing
and deepening Islam’s influence in Turkey and the relations with the main
Islamic party.
<p>The tolerance shown by part of the security establishment - especially
those in the ministry of interior and the police who came to senior positions
due to their Islamic views or connections - helped terrorist groups in
their formative period. It was another sign of the penetration of Islamic
influence in the secular security establishment. The top military echelons
were clearly worried by this trend and the threat of “reactionism” to the
military discipline and it seems that the uncovered attempt of one of the
police agencies to spy on the National Security Council fostered its decision
to confront the Erbakan government and force it to resign.[75]
<p>Iran’s radical anti-secular, anti-Zionist ideology explains the close
cooperation with the terrorist Islamic groups in Turkey. Commenting on
an anti-Turkish demonstration of Turkish Islamists in Tehran, an Iranian
daily claimed that the domination of secularism and Zionism are “the two
anti-Islamic platforms linked together in the artificial and short history
of Turkey” and that the Muslim people of Turkey has the right to protest
those who have imposed “these two flimsy and foreign ideas on their fates.”
According to the commentator, “Zionism’s increasing mischief, the inefficiency
of the broken arrow of secularism, the growing religious awareness of Muslims
and of political Islam in Turkey” permitted RP’s anti-alien, anti-Zionist,
anti-secularist policies to emerge, for the first time in 73 years, as
the main political party.[76]
<p>Riding on the Islamic anti-secular, anti-Zionist wave, the Iranian government
also achieved a more immediate tactical bonus by liquidating dozens of
Iranian opposition activists. The fact that part of the “dirty work” was
done by radical Turkish groups made the attacks more effective and made
it easier for the Iranian government to deny involvement in the killings.
At the same time, the Turkish terrorist organizations profited materially
from Iranian backing in training, logistical support, weapons and explosives
and a much needed safe-haven.
<p>Although Iran claimed Iranian-Turkish relations were optimal during
Ozal’s government, Iranian support to Turkish terrorist groups began as
early as 1987 and peaked in the early 1990s when he served as Turkey’s
President. It is more realistic to assume that Iran tried to take advantage
of the “Turkish-Islamic Synthesis” policy and Ozal’s government pro-Islamic
tendencies in order to accelerate the radicalization of the Islamic movement.
<p>The pressure on Turkey grew after the Gulf War, when Iran felt stronger
regionally, eager to counter-balance Turkey’s influence in Central Asia
and encouraged by the lack of reaction from the Turkish authorities, at
least until 1993. The weakening of the Islamic radicals and the RP’s strengthening
in the Turkish political arena, reduced Iran’s role, though it substantially
increased its support to the PKK guerrilla and terrorist activity.
<p>There is no doubt that the dramatic decrease in the terrorist activity
of radical Islamic groups is mainly a consequence of the determined counter-action
taken by the Turkish security forces beginning 1993 and the following years.
Yet, the lack of any major act of Islamic terrorism during Erbakan’s premiership
and until the decision of the Constitutional Court to outlaw his party
leaves us with some question marks about the strategy of thesegroups and
the real goals of their leaders and sponsors.
<p><b>The Turkish Military Lead an All-out Fight to Eradicate the Islamist
Forces</b>
<br>Even the growing military and strategic cooperation between Turkey
and Israel during 1996 and 1997 did not generate any particular violent
activity against the Turkish defense establishment or Israeli targets,
in spite of the clear opposition of the <i>Refah</i> Party and the uneasiness
and anxiety it provoked in Iran.
<p>However, the Turkish military gave no respite to the new Islamic prime
minister. On August 3, 1996, the Supreme Military Council (SMC) convened
under Erbakan and all the commanders declared that “reactionism”, i.e.
Islamic fundamentalism, is becoming an important threat to Turkey and that
the problem of attire, the way people dress, is in fact a question of “intention
and ideology”. The military observed that although the extreme religious
trends have intensified their activities, the matter was not discussed
in the SMC during the past year.[77] This meeting could be seen as the
watershed in the Turkish Army’s decision to unequivocally end the era of
the <i>Turkish-Islamic Synthesis</i> strategy and embark upon an all-out
fight against the Islamist forces, the political and the violent one.
<p>Following this first direct warning, President Demirel sent several
warning letters to the government, without result. On 27 January 1997 the
National Security Council (NSC) met and asked the prime minister to take
action, and not only make statements, in order to stop the “illegal activities”
and defend the secular regime. Finally, the NSC met again on 28 February
1997 and the military commanders attacked the government’s conduct and
asked for urgent action unless “undesirable” developments may take place.
<p>The twenty urgent demands of the Army included “enforcement of neglected
constitutional requirements on dress codes and on banning of sufi brotherhoods;
reversal of worrisome social and political trends, such as the growth of
religious schools and infiltration of Islamists into the bureaucracy; special
restrictions implicitly aimed at Refah, such as limits on cash transactions
by Islamist groups and acceptance of party responsibility for the ‘unconstitutional,’
i.e., anti-secular, behavior of its members; and careful monitoring of
Iranian efforts to ‘destabilize’ Turkey.”[78]
<p>Erbakan avoided the implementation of NSC’s decisions and persisted
even in anticipating the possibility of “defense industrial cooperation”
with Iran. But the breaking point was the “Jerusalem Day” incident in January
1997: The mayor of Sincan, a suburb near Ankara, organized a “Jerusalem
Night” with the support of Iranian diplomats. During that night he hanged
large posters of the leaders of foreign Islamist terrorist organizations,
like Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Hizballah, and said that he “will
infuse the shari’a into the intellectual sector.” Following the mayor’s
arrest by the Ankara State Security Court a minister visited him in prison
in an attempt to create the image that he was protesting the court’s verdict.
Erbakan neither condemned the remarks nor dissociated himself from them.[79]
<p>The events succeeded abruptly: on June 18, 1997, under Army’s pressure,
Erbakan was forced to resign; on 16 January 1998 the Constitutional Court
outlawed the <i>Refah</i> Party and barred Erbakan from political life
for five years; in February 1998 a new party, the Virtue Party (<i>Fazilet
Partisi</i> - FP), replaced the RP, gathering in its ranks some 130 parliamentarians
from the old movement.
<p>The Turkish Army’s thinking concerning the threat of Islamic extremism
to the secular regime was clearly and systematically presented in the speech
delivered by Lt. Gen. Cetin Saner, chief of intelligence of the General
Staff, in the briefing organized in June 1997 by the Office of the Chief
of the General Staff [OCGS] entitled “Reactionary Activities.”[80] There
is no place here for more than several passages from this remarkable document,
therefore the citations will relate only to the specific themes interesting
this article.
<p>At the opening there is an implicit recognition of the failure of the
<i>Turkish-Islamist
Synthesis</i> strategy: “Following the transition to a multiparty system
and as a result of concessions made to the detriment of Ataturkist principles
and reforms, the reactionary sector stepped up its work to organize nationally
under the umbrella of democracy.” Then comes the admission that “this situation
has turned individual fundamentalist activities into a mass movement [and]
has created a climate that encourages and rewards those who raise a green
banner instead of the sacred flag of the Turkish Republic.” Even the appearance
of separatist movements [the Kurdish problem] is attributed to “the authority
vacuum,” to “[t]hose who do not wish to recognize the Turkish national
identity and…have undertaken activities behind the guise of the more international
religious identity…as a first step toward their ultimate goal of destroying
the unity and harmony of the Turkish Republic.”
<p>The speech contains a lengthy description of the activities and incidents
which have led, particularly since the advent of the Erbakan government,
to the actual dangerous situation, and the huge political,[81] social,[82]
economical[83] and propaganda[84] infrastructure built by the Islamist
movements and organizations during the last years. Then the Chief of Intelligence
enumerates the facts relating to the Islamic terrorist activity, its cooperation
with the PKK, its connections with the political sector and the support
it has received from Iran.
<dir>
<blockquote><font size=+0>- A “proreactionary” parliamentary [is accused
of declaring] that the Army cannot ignore millions of supporters of political
Islam who voted for a certain political party [Refah] [and] asking his
constituency to prepare for a jihad against the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF).
He [affirmed] that those who cannot contend with 3,500 PKK militants would
be unable to cope with 6 million supporters of political Islam.</font>
<p><font size=+0>- The “reactionary sector” has approached the terrorist
problems in the east and the southeast [of Turkey] that have threatened
the integrity of the country for many years with an “ummetist” ideology
[a unifying Islamic view] as part of its efforts to expand its constituency
in that region.</font>
<p><font size=+0>- It has been determined that the separatist terror organization
[PKK] sees radical Islamist groups as its closest allies in its drive to
realize its objectives against Turkey and that it promotes the training
given in its camps in northern Iraq as preparation for jihad. Commenting
on the rise of the reactionary sector, the head of the separatist terror
organization [Abdullah Ocalan] appraised the growth of reactionary activities
as a suitable opportunity for the realization of their goals and openly
declared that ties with this sector must be further developed.</font>
<p><font size=+0>- An “Association of Imams” was formed in accordance with
the decisions of the second conference of the [PKK] in Lebanon; it was
decided to turn every mosque “into a center of propaganda and rebellion.”
Certain separatist and proreactionary imams in some mosques implemented
these decisions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>- The terrorist organization [PKK] brought into being
an organization named “Kurdistan Islamic Movement” with the purpose of
reaching larger masses. At the congress of the Kurdistan Islamic Movement
in July 1993 a series of decisions were made to expand ties with other
religious groups, to induct women into the war, to unite so-called Kurdistan
and to revive the old Kurdish madrassas [religious schools] and religious
complexes.</font>
<p><font size=+0>- It is becoming increasingly evident that the separatist
terror organization [PKK], whose influence in Turkey has been declining
steadily, is now working behind and with the support of reactionary elements
at home and abroad and that it is trying to generate new options by forming
an alliance with them.</font>
<p><font size=+0>- When the ties of the reactionary sector with Islamist
terrorist organizations and countries that support international terrorism,
chiefly Iran, to achieve its aims are examined, the following situation
is seen:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>Iran has systematically provided every type ofmaterial and
moral support to have a shari’a-based regime established in Turkey.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>There are findings that Iran controls Hezbollah, Selam, and
the Islamic Movement, which are radical Islamist organizations that engage
in terrorist activities, and that the senior administrators of these organizations
are being trained in Iran.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>Iran provides financial support, passports, and shelter in
Iran for militants of Islamic terrorist organizations who are involved
in terrorist acts in Turkey.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>Iran supports the reactionary sector with propaganda, especially
through the press, and thus flagrantly interferes in Turkey’s internal
affairs.</font></li>

<li>
</li>
</ul>
</dir>
<font size=+0>- It is known that Sudan also has close ties with the reactionary
sector in Turkey and that it provides support to Islamic terror organizations.</font></blockquote>
</dir>
The Chief of Intelligence remarked that the “National Security Policy Document,
approved by Decree No. 92/3514 of the Council of Ministers on 17 September
1992, saw “the Kurdish separatist terrorist as the most urgent threat Turkey
faced at that period and the shari’a-based Islamist threat, which has been
supported and developed by certain Islamic nations, only as a serious peril
against the secular state order.” It is only after the 28 February 1997
NSC meeting and as a result of the situation described above that the OCGS
classified the threat posed by Islamist activities in Turkey at the same
level as the PKK terrorist threat.
<p>TAF’s conclusion is that “ the triangle of commerce, politics, and <i>tarikats</i>
is operating actively” in Turkey and that some 30 radical organizations
active “in the reactionary sector” are not satisfied with the public protests
staged by them against NSC’s decisions. They have argued that it is necessary
to undertake violent action and therefore it is “highly probable that these
radical organizations may organize themselves over a broader base and resort
to terrorist actions as developments unfold.”
<p>Based on Article 35 of Law No. 211 on Domestic Service of the Turkish
Armed Forces and restated in Article 85/1 of the TAF’s Domestic Service
Governing Statute the OCGS reiterates its responsibility “[t]o defend,
if necessary by arms, the Turkish homeland and republic against domestic
and external threats.” In order to cope with this threat, a new unit, the
Western Working Group, was formed and put into operation. Through this
organization, “the TAF is developing a snapshot of political Islam across
the country and monitoring closely and methodically the general scene related
to reactionary activities across the country and in all its dimensions.”
<p>In late July 1997, clashes erupted into violence in the first major
Islamic demonstration since the forced resignation in June of Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan. At least 13 people were wounded and scores arrested
in clashes in Ankara, between police and thousands of Islamists protesting
a government plan to curtail religious education severely in secondary
schools.[85] But calm situation on the radical Islamic front continued
after Erbakan’s resignation and the decision of Turkey’s Constitutional
Court to outlaw the RP on December 16, 1997.
<p>The impact of the secular military and civil establishment’s firm policy
could be felt after the elections to the Turkish parliament in April 1999.
The Islamist Virtue Party, the biggest grouping in the previous parliament
and successor of the banned RP took only 15 percent of the vote, suffering
a bitter defeat, although it succeeded to re-elect its mayors in the country’s
two largest cities, Istanbul and Ankara. The real winners of these elections
were the prime minister Bulent Ecevit and his Democratic Left Party (DLP)
and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), which took about 18 percent of
the vote, astonishing even its own leaders.[86] Many votes for Nationalist
Action came at Virtue Party’s expense, apparently cast by voters trying
to show their dissatisfaction with the political establishment.[87] Both
Ecevit and the MHP appeared to have gained from fears of Kurdish activism
and what analysts called the “Ocalan Factor.” Ecevit saw his popularity
rise enormously with the capture of PKK’s leader Abdullah Ocalan shortly
after he took office in January 1999.[88]
<p>“Virtue’s decline will pull Turkey away from the appearance of a country
where radical Islam is on the rise,” commented Ertugrul Ozkok, editor of
the <i>Hurriyet</i> newspaper.[89] The Constitutional Court opened a closure
case against the Virtue Party after the April 18, 1999 elections on the
charges that the party was carrying out anti-secular activities and was
the successor of the RP.[90]
<p><b>Terrorist and Counter-terrorist Activities in the Wake of RP’s Downfall</b>
<br>It is difficult to have an accurate picture of the terrorist activity
of Islamist groups in Turkey since 1997. Lists of the most active radical
groups were publicized in various official reports. Most of the data published
by the Turkish press relates to the terrorist activities of IBDA-C in the
big cities, Istanbul and Ankara. Hizbullah is active mainly in eastern
and southeastern Anatolia and the national press rarely reports its attacks.[91]
These actions surface when members of Hizbullah are detained in police
operations, and generally are not detailed. There is also a difference
between the targets attacked by the two main organizations: while IBDA-C
targeted secular journalists and intellectuals, symbolic sites of the secular
regime, Christian (Greek) shrines, and even brothels (!), Hizbullah focused
in killing and wounding people in the southeastern provinces (including
militants suspected to be informers of the police), extorting money and
engaging in organizational activities in primary and high schools, universities,
mosques, and shrines.[92]
<p>After a lull in IBDA-C’s activity in 1997 and 1998 the organization
staged a series of attacks beginning October 1999, which could be regarded
as a campaign to emphasize its renewed strength.[93] The most important
and striking attack has been the assassination the 21<sup>st</sup> October
1999 of Ahmet Taner Kislali, a former minister, academic and respected
newspaper columnist, killed outside his home in Ankara by a homemade pipe
bomb placed on top of his car. Although several conspiratorial theories
have been proposed regarding this event, taking in consideration the intensive
terrorist activity developed by IBDA-C during these weeks, it is quite
probable that it stood behind the killing of a staunch defender of the
secular regime and values. In June 1999 the General Directorate of Security
affirmed that it has received a tip-off saying that IBDA-C was preparing
to assassinate Premier Bulent Ecevit.[94]
<p>One of the reasons for the assassination and the terrorist autumn campaign
could be the trial of Salih Izzet Erdis, (<i>alias</i> Salih Mirzabeyoglu),
considered to be the leader of IBDA-C, and three of his deputies. These
militants were caught as a result of operations conducted on 29 December
1998 against the organization. According to security officials the arrests
thwarted planned bloody attacks. The organization planned these operations
because in 1998 the holy month of Ramadan and New Year’s Eve were celebrated
at the same time.[95] Their trial began in April 1999 and the Istanbul
State Security Court accused Erdis of “attempting to topple the existing
constitutional order through the use of force” and asked the death sentence
for him.[96] During the trial, dozens of sympathizers of IBDA-C manifested
violently in front of the court and more than thirty were arrested.
<p>As a result, the Turkish security authorities intensified the counter-terrorist
measures and arrested many active members of the organization, although
they did not found the connection with Kislali’s assassination. On 15 November
twenty members of IBDA-C have been caught getting ready to carry out sensational
acts of terrorism in Istanbul. In searches conducted on the suspects and
in places they indicated, numerous weapons, bombs, material used for making
bombs, and organizational documents were found. The police has claimed
that the suspects were getting ready to assassinate several well-known
personalities, including Professor YaNuri Ozturk, dean of the Theology
School at Istanbul University, and writer and columnist Fatih Altayli.[97]
They were also preparing to stage bomb attacks on November 6, to protest
the foundation anniversary of the Institution of Higher Education (YOK).
Hasan Ozdemir, the Director General of Istanbul<b> </b>Police<b> </b>stressed
that Erdis, IBDA-C’s imprisoned leader, declared 1999 as “The Year of Conquest.”[98]
<p>According to Turkish officials, 20 separate operations were staged against
IBDA-C in 1998 and 1999. 166 suspects were captured and 35 acts of terror
were clarified by their capture.
<p>As stated above, the terrorist activity of Hizbullah is not detailed
in the open sources available to the researcher. Therefore the number of
attacks, of the victims and the damage involved, is not known. But what
is clear from the published data is that the security authorities have
waged a relentless campaign against the military and civil infrastructure
of all Hizbullah’s branches, considered to be the most powerful and dangerous
of all the Islamist violent organizations. These extensive counter-terrorist
operations were carried on parallel to the well-publicized war against
the PKK guerrilla forces in southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq, but
received no attention from the foreign media.
<p>The first wave of arrests began in spring 1998. On 22 April 1998 the
Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu stated that the operations that have
been launched against Hizbullah, in the eastern and southeastern Anatolian
provinces in particular, are continuing in an intensive manner. By the
end of the month, 130 of the 1,000 wanted militants were captured in Diyarbakir
alone. Some of the weapons seized were used in the murder of four people
and the wounding of two others between 1993 and 1996. Dozens of other militants
have been arrested in May in Batman, Mersin and the Mus province. It was
reported that as a result of the heavy blows suffered by the organization
it even prepared for suicide attacks, in order to boost the morale of its
militants.
<p>Operations and arrests continued sporadically at the end of 1998,[99]
but more serious counter-terrorist campaigns followed in March 1999, when
a total of 400 members of Hizbullah were captured during operations launched
in southeastern Diyarbakir, Mardin and Batman provinces, and again in June.[100]
Parallel to the tracking of IBDA-C terrorists in October and November 1999,
the operations against Hizbullah continued with the arrest in a major round
up of nearly 100 militants in Diyarbakir, including a number of senior
figures. A large number of weapons and documents belonging to the organization
were also seized. In November it was announced that Hizbullah’s organization
in eastern Turkey has been completely cracked as a result of an operation
in which large quantities of weapons were also seized.[101] According to
police, seven of those arrested have asked for amnesty under the terms
of a “Repentance Law” recently adopted by the Turkish parliament.
<p>In January 1999, Kemal Donmez, the Chairman of Struggle Against Terrorism
Department, summing up the counter-terrorist activity of his organization
declared that a total of 3,793 people were captured within 10 years in
operations launched against illegal fundamentalist organizations like Hizbullah,
IBDA-C, Islamist Movement and Islamic Communities Union.[102] The arrest
of many Hizbullah militants brought to light 800 crimes, 400 of which were
unsolved murders.
<p>In spite of the successes of the Turkish security forces, the struggle
to eradicate these violent Islamic groups is far from over. It was revealed
that the organization is composed of at least 20,000 people and strives
to establish a “Kurdish-Islam”` state in Southeastern Anatolian Region.
The latest operations have shown that the organizational skills and overall
strength of Hizbullah were much greater than previously assumed. In the
floppy disks seized during the arrests, the names of thousands of members
of the organization were recorded but not all of these people could possibly
be militants and most of them are probably sympathizers or people who provided
outside support to the terrorist organization.[103]

<P><p><b>The Terrorist-Political Connection</b>
<br>The fight against the Islamist forces has been not less intense on
the political ground. In 1999, for the first time the former Islamist prime
minister was accused of being directly involved in connections with terrorist
organizations. In March, the State Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel accused Necmettin
Erbakan of participating on 25 December 1993, in Tehran, in meetings with
the [Greek] 17 November organization, Fatah (sic), the Lebanese Hizballah,
the Japanese Red Army, Abu-Nidal Group, Turkish Hizbullah, and the RP members
under the chairmanship of [Iran’s president] Khamene’i. The accusation
was based on the testimony of Altan Karamanoglu, the [former Turkish] Ambassador
in Baku. In that meeting it was decided to establish a joint command which
would provisionally be headquartered in Iran but moved to Turkey when a
theocratic regime would be set up there.[104]
<p>According to an indictment prepared by Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel, the
RP’s former Deputy Chairman Ahmet Tekdal and former Deputies Sevki Yilmaz,
Hasan Huseyin Ceylan and Ibrahim Halil Celik are facing death sentences
in accordance with Article 146 of the Turkish Penal Code on charges that
they tried to undermine the current constitutional state system and replace
it with a state based on religious principles. The 75-page indictment states
that the National View, the main ideological body of the Islamists, aimed
to replace the current democratic system with another one with an Islamic
basis.[105]
<p>The Virtue Party (FP) and RP were also accused of links with radical
Islamic organizations abroad, such as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)
of Algeria and the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria. Past speeches by the accused
were given as evidence against them. Calls for <i>Jihad</i>, have been
made several times by leaders of the National View, but they have always
stressed that <i>Jihad</i> would not mean an armed struggle. The indictment
charges the National View of contacts with IBDA-C.
<p>Most importantly, representatives of the National View reportedly had
contacts with the PKK. Attributing recent revelations to the imprisoned
leader of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, the indictment accuses Erbakan that
during his tenure as prime minister he has promised to legitimize the “status
of bandits.”
<p>According to the prosecutor, based on legal interpretation of the Turkish
law, there is no need to necessarily resort to armed action to face criminal
charges under TPC Article 146 for “attempting to overthrow the constitutional
order [because] those who already control the power and population of the
state do not have to necessarily resort to force to be charged with the
crime of violating the constitution.”[106]
<p>The same prosecutor launched a probe into remarks against secularism
broadcasted on a private television channel by the well-known and respected
Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen. According to the broadcasted recordings,
Gulen had warned a group of his followers that, “If they come out early,
the world will squash their heads. They would make Muslims once again relive
incidents such as those that occurred in Algeria,<b><font size=+2> </font></b>Syria
and Egypt.” In the recording Gulen also underlined the importance of expanding
his group within the civil and justice administrations. “In these entities
will be our guarantee for the future,” he said. Prosecutors apparently
believe that Gulen was warning his followers that if they rose up before
they were fully prepared, they would face defeat and therefore asked capital
punishment for Gulen on suspicion of plotting religious unrest in Turkey.[107]
<p>Finally, in July 1999, Uzbek dissidents convicted of having a role in
a February 1999 assassination attempt against President of Uzbekistan Islam
Karimov have claimed that former Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
had helped them financially. The testimonies were broadcast on Uzbekistan
television.[108]
<p><b>Hizbullah Plans To Take Over PKK Cadres</b>
<br>One of the possible consequencesof PKK’s decline as a fighting organization
against the Turkish state, after the demise of its guerrilla strategy and
the new peace process strategy devised by its imprisoned leader Abdullah
Ocalan, could be a strengthening of the radical Islamist groups, and mainly
Hizbullah.
<p>As remarked at the beginning of this article, the relations between
the PKK and some of the Islamic radical groups at the beginning of the
1990s were marked by ideological conflict and rivalry over the same Kurdish
constituency in southeastern Turkey. At times this conflict permitted the
Turkish authorities to use the more extremist elements of Islamic Kurdish
Hizbullah in their fight against the nationalist Kurdish PKK. This situation
changed in 1993, when the two conflicting sides understood the danger of
the internecine strife and arrived to an agreement of <i>modus-vivendi</i>
and common struggle against the Kemalist regime. It seems that since then
the PKK and most of the Islamist radicals cooperated on the local operational
arena.[109]
<p>Hasan Yalcin, acting leader of the Labor Party, has claimed that a cooperation
agreement, which includes the perpetrating of some attacks, was signed
between the ARGK [People’s Liberation Army of Kurdistan], the military
wing of the PKK, and the fundamentalist Rahmet Group. He affirmed that
there exists a protocol between the PKK and IBDA-C about common terrorist
training. Within this framework, the PKK took some IBDA-C militants to
Greece where they underwent training in acts of sabotage. According to
Yalcin, the agreement between the PKK and the Hizbullah is also still in
force. Kemal Donmez, the Chairman of Struggle Against Terrorism Department,
also declared that IBDA-C from time to time cooperated with PKK.
<p>According to the Istanbul <i>Hurriyet,</i> Hizbullah avoided an armed
clash with the PKK since 1995 and has taken punitive measures against it
only on rare occasions, because it views the PKK militants as a “ready
military force.” The Hizbullah views whatever belongs to the PKK as property
that can be taken “free of charge” and could be inherited in case Ocalan
is executed and his organization dismembered.[110]
<p>Dr. Emin Gurses, from the Department of International Relations at Sakarya
University, thinks that the PKK is in a process of disintegration and that
the void will be filled by an organization built on “religious discrimination.”
He defined the new threat as Hizbul-PKK. Associate Professor Umit Ozdag,
from the School of Political Sciences at Gazi University, stated that it
would be very difficult for the PKK to continue without the leadership
of Ocalan, which was behind the raising of money in Europe. Without financial
backing, the organization cannot survive with leaders like Cemil Bayik
or Osman Ocalan. In his opinion Hizbullah is building up seriously, although
it does not have yet the practical experience of the PKK. He also speaks
about the threat of a Hizbul-PKK.[111]
<p><b>“The Iranian Connection” Revisited</b>
<br>The Iranian regime welcomed the new pro-Islamic policy of Erbakan and
tried to make the best of it, on the economic as well as on the political
level. But the warming in relations did not interfere with the overall
strategy of furthering the Islamization of Turkey. In February 1997, Mohammad
Reza Baqeri, the Iranian ambassador to Turkey participated in an Islamic
meeting for the <i>al-Quds</i> Day in Ankara’s Sincan district together
with the RP mayor, from where he called for the liberation of Jerusalem.
This incident gave the Turkish army the occasion for a symbolic manifestation
of the strength of its armored forces in the streets of Sincan and caused
the expulsion of the un-diplomatic ambassador.
<p>In an interview to the Istanbul <i>Turkiye</i>, the Iranian ambassador
said that at Sincan he only spoke about facts concerning Israel and that
beyond that he did not even make any slight hint about Turkey, “I did not
mention Hizbullah or anything like that. I simply produced historic examples
to show that Israel is a fundamentalist state. I did not even mention Yasir
‘Arafat.” He added, candidly, that the year before he had presented a far
tougher speech at Jerusalem Day, but then the press did not even devote
a line to it. “Had the RP not been in government this year the press would
again not have mentioned it. It is inconceivable to use a neighboring country
to get rid of the RP, and that without justification,” complained the ambassador.[112]
<p>The expanding military cooperation and the common maneuvers of the Turkish
and Israeli naval forces, which Erbakan was not able to cancel, caused
great concern in the Iranian governmental circles and were considered a
new American-Zionist plot to isolate and encircle Iran.[113] The Iranian
regime considers the conflict with Turkey not merely as a strategic and
political competition between two rival regional powers, but mostly as
an ideological battle between its radical Islamic worldview and Turkey’s
“adamant [will] to translate into practice the western concept of secularism”.[114]
<p>After PKK’s expulsion from Syria, in October 1998 and the capture of
its leader Abdullah Ocalan in February 1999 in Kenya, Iran was accused
of actively supporting the Kurdish organization and trying to use it against
Turkey. Turkish intelligence established that Osman Ocalan, Abdullah’s
brother, who aspires to be the new leader of the PKK, is under the protection
of government officials in Iran and that he meets them occasionally for
talks. It was reported that Iran is preparing Osman Ocalan and his men
for bloody terrorist attacks against Turkey and providing them with logistic
and technical aid. According to information provided to Turkey by reliable
sources, Iran is seeking to pursue the same policy of supporting terrorism
against Turkey that Syria tried for some time to employ without avail.[115]
<p>According to the Turkish press, Tehran wants to control not only the
PKK but also Hizbullah, which is organized in the same region. During his
interrogation, PKK’s leader Abdullah Ocalan admitted that Iran served as
mediator between the PKK and Turkish Hizbullah. Seyit, an Iranian secret
service agent visited Ocalan occasionally in Syria until 1996 and discussed
the border question with him. Ocalan asked Seyit to mediate in the confrontation
between PKK and Hizbullah.[116]
<p>In July 1999 the Turkish authorities reported again that according to
information provided by Abdulaziz Tunc, the first “confessor” of Hizbullah,
and an assistant of its escaped leader, Huseyin Velioglu, Iran provided
support to this terrorist organization. Tunc and other members of the Hizbullah
traveled to Iran in 1988 and were trained there under the auspices of the
Iranian administration on how to use hand grenades, automatic weapons and
rockets.[117]
<p>The same month Tehran complained that Turkey had bombed an Iranian border
town at the mountainous junction of the Iranian, Iraqi, and Turkish borders
- an area used by PKK guerrillas - killing five people and wounding ten.
Iran retorted by capturing two Turkish soldiers accused of straying into
Iranian territory while pursuing the PKK; rather than return the soldiers
immediately, Iran initially announced that they would be put on trial.
These incidents fueled the bilateral tension between the two countries.[118]
<p>On the political level the military incidents were accompanied by harsh
criticism of the Iranian regime by Turkish prime minister Bulent Ecevit,
who labeled student protest demonstrations in Iran’s cities a “natural”
reaction against an “outdated regime of oppression.” Ecevit accused Iran
of replacing Syria as the biggest base for rebels of the PKK. “It seems
that Iran has taken Syria’s place to a great extent,” the Anatolian News
Agency quoted Ecevit as saying.
<p>The tension was defused after the liberation of the two soldiers taken
prisoners and a series of Turkish-Iranian security meetings focusing on
Tehran’s allegedly growing support to anti-Turkish organizations. Korkmaz
Haktanir, the Undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, visited Iran
between October 17-18 and had talks with the Iranian leaders. During the
talks Iran was asked to be vigilant against terrorists uIranian territory
for transit passages. Sermet Atacanli, the Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman,
later stated that security mechanisms between Turkey and Iran were set
up and as a result of the operation of the security mechanism positive
developments are taking place.[119]
<p>The Turkish daily <i>Milliyet</i> analysed Iran’s policy in this context:
“Democratic and modern Turkey that nonetheless respects and is committed
to its religion constitutes a model for the Iranians, and the Tehran regime
is uneasy about that.” Tehran is also aware of its military weakness. Iran’s
economy is frail and the latest student protests demonstrated that there
are many dissatisfied people ready to oppose the regime. Moreover, Iran
is worried by the possible attitude of its important Azeri Turk minority.
All these factors entail that even if Iran creates difficulties it is unlikely
to risk a hot war with Turkey. But, “[w]ill Turkish-Iranian relations return
to normal if this crisis is over? Will there not be new grounds for disputes?”
asks the Turkish newspaper. Its estimation is that even after the end of
the prisoners’ crisis Iran will not want to pursue friendship with Turkey
as long as it does not have a democratic and strong regime and the stormy
relationship between the two countries will continue.[120]
<p>The Iranian estimation concerning the thorny bilateral relations, as
conveyed by the Tehran daily <i>Resalat,</i> is not optimistic either.
The bombing by Turkish military aircraft on Iranian territory “has put
the Iranian nation in psychological conditions of war and rancour toward
the government and the military ruling over Turkey.” The newspaper accuses
the Ecevit government and his personal remarks to be responsible for directing
the Turkish anger against Iran, because it regards Islam in Turkey as an
extension of the growing Islamic tendency in Iran. Moreover, the Turkish
military aggression against Iran must be seen not only “in terms of that
country’s national interests and objectives…but also as the direct result
of Turkey’s membership of NATO …and its special ties with America and the
Zionist regime.” It stresses the fact that the recent incidents coincided
with president Demirel’s visit “to the occupied Palestine.” Turkey is presented
therefore as a linking platform between military activity against Iran
and “the centers controlling those activities in the West and the Zionist
regime.” Thus, even if the present crisis was over “enmity and hatred would
still continue to remain in the minds of the Iranian nation.”[121]
<p><b>The Impact of the Turkish-Israeli Strategic Agreement</b>
<br>According to Alan Makovsky, since the Gulf War Turkey has emerged as
a regional power, both in fact and in self-image. This renewed self-confidence
and new activism include its relationship with Israel and the willingness
to threaten to use force when it deems necessary, as during the crisis
with Syria in September-October 1998.[122]
<p>Turkey and Israel are both Western-oriented and pro-U.S., deeply concerned
about terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism. They are also the two most
democratic, economically dynamic, and militarily powerful states in the
region.[123] Therefore, it was quite natural for the two states that have
kept good relations from 1949 on, sometimes discreet or secret, to arrive
finally in 1996 to a strategic agreement which included common military
training, defense industrial cooperation, collaboration in gathering intelligence
on Syria, Iran, and Iraq, and free trade (bilateral trade, virtually non-existent
in 1990 and roughly $450 million in 1998, will reach more than $1 billion
by the year 2000).[124]
<p>The irony of the history let it happen during Erbakan’s premiership.
Although the RP and Erbakan were staunch opponents to the Turkish-Israeli
alliance, they were forced by the military “to swallow the frog” and sign
it against their will. The signing of the agreement by Erbakan himself
signaled to his followers and his opponents alike the weakness of the Islamist
movement and the limits of its political weight.
<p>This event seems to indicate the final step of the secular Turkish establishment,
under the pressure of the unanimous military command, to resolutely leave
behind the failed <i>Turkish-Islamic Synthesis</i> strategy and profiting
from the new international set-up to definitely subdue the growing Islamist
movement and neutralize its political, social and violent strongholds.
The alliance also allowed defeating militarily the PKK, seen more and more
as an objective ally of the Islamists, by forcing Syria to expel its leader
and militants and stop any support to the Kurdish separatist movement.
<p>On October 26, 1999, General Cevik Bir (ret.), former deputy chief of
the Turkish General Staff, addressing The Washington Institute’s Policy
Forum on Turkish-Israeli relations and Turkish security in the region remarked
that “Turkey became a ‘front country’ in the region when new threats emerged
after the Cold War…The initiation of Turkish-Israeli relations should be
seen in this light. Contrary to the beliefs of some, neither the United
States nor any other third party initiated Turkish-Israeli cooperation
or the 1996 military training and cooperation agreement. These were the
initiatives of the Turkish leadership.”[125] General Bir affirmed that
this military agreement paved the way for resolution of the Turkish-Syrian
crisis of autumn 1998 and in his opinion Syria’s more responsive attitude
toward Turkey since then proves that the Turkish-Israeli agreement works.[126]
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>The Islamic fundamentalist movement in Turkey has many common features
with movements in many Muslim countries but, as we have seen, it has understood
the constraints and dangers of a direct clash with the nationalist Kemalist
ideology and, above all, with a military establishment sworn to defend
the secular regime and its values at all costs. The use of Islam by the
new intellectual and economic elite and military for their own political
needs - believing they could tame and transform it to be a pillar of the
regime - has been skillfully exploited by the Islamic movement in its bid
to achieve power and install an Islamic regime.
<p>This is also true regarding the more radical, violent off-shoots of
the Islamic movement. Their expansion and relative freedom of action was
tolerated on the same grounds until they became a real threat for internal
political stability. The RP’s parallel growth, electoral success, and its
leadership’s indulgence toward the Islamists’ terror has no doubt encouraged
and fed their violence.
<p>It is noteworthy that following <i>Refah’s</i> biggest electoral success
in December 1995 and until the resignation of Erbakan’s government in June
1997, no serious terror acts were perpetrated by Islamic groups, except
low-level actions waged by IBDA-C, the most independent of these groups.
It is possible that Erbakan’s policy to boost relations with Iran and Libya
has given the radical groups the impression, or the hope, that the RP government
will indeed succeed in following a more extremist Islamic policy.
<p>The resignation of Erbakan’s government under the army’s pressure, the
new government’s steps to curtail Islamic influence on the education system,
the outlawing of the RP, and the recent steps to outlaw its successor the
FP, have changed the “rules of the game.” The secular establishment, under
the double pressure of the powerful military and the anxious Turkish people,
faithful in his majority to the Kemalist ideology and regime, has definitely
renounced the hope that the <i>Turkish-Islamic Synthesis</i> could represent
a solution to the intricate problems faced by Turkey. It has understood
that this strategy has only advanced the interests of the Islamist movement,
which was on the point to take control of the county or to turn it in a
new Algeria.
<p>The self-confidence given by its new strategic status as a result of
the Gulf War, the fall of the Soviet empire, the liberation of the Turk
people in Central Asia, the weakening of the Iranian regime on the internal
arena, the strategic agreement with Israel, have permitted Turkey to challenge
resolutely the growing radical Islamicforces and bring their failure.
<p>Until 1996, despite the exposure of its key role in backing the terrorist
activity of Turkish Islamic groups, Iran paid a very low price for it.
Iran welcomed RP’s rise to power and in exchange Erbakan did his best to
improve bilateral relations and overlook its involvement in terrorist dealings.
<p>Iran is entangled in an internal strife between the more moderate policy
proposed by the President, Khatami, and the old revolutionary strategy
sustained by the Spiritual leader, Khamene’i, and the radicals who keep
the key posts in the political and security establishment.[127] It seems
that on the issue of the relations with Turkey, as on other important subjects,
the radicals have the upper hand and prefer to walk on the tight rope between
seemingly correct bilateral relations and a strategy of subversion through
the enfeebled PKK and the remnants of the violent Islamist movement.
<p>According to the evaluation of Alan Makovsky, the specialist on Turkey
of the Washington Institute, Turkey’s relations with Iran have much in
common with its relations with Syria before the Ocalan expulsion. Turkey
does not want confrontation with Iran, and Ecevit no doubt wants a diplomatic
resolution to Iran’s support for the PKK. “Given Turkey’s more assertive
regional policies of recent times, Ankara likely will continue to press
Tehran - over time perhaps with threats or even limited use of force -
if the Iranians do not alter their behavior and rein in the PKK” he says.[128]
<p>Last year, Turkey threatened to use force unless Syria dismantled PKK
bases on its territory and expelled rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Syria
bowed to Turkish pressure. Asked whether the row with Iran could reach
the same intensity, president Suleyman Demirel said, “No, no, I don’t think
so; at least not for the time being. “[129]

<font size=-1>IBDA-C’s monthly, <i>Taraf</i>, gives some addresses of its
representatives in Europe. In Germany there are several extremist Islamic
Turkish organizations. The most active is “The Islamic Communities Union”

<li>
<font size=-1>According to Erbakan, Western “imperialist” institutions
and “Zionist Wall Street bankers” seek mainly to exploit Turkey and the
Islamic countries and Washington is the tool of “Zionist forces.” RP’s
politicians and daily newspapers have blamed the Jews, Zionism and Israel
for every domestic and foreign problem of Turkey. See Sayari, pp. 41-41

<li>
<font size=-1>Political Islam has accumulated considerable power with its
2,500 associations, 500 foundations, more than 1,000 corporations, 1,200
student dormitories and more than 800 private schools and classrooms.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>It has been determined that there are 1,685,000 continuing
students registered in Koranic courses and that their numbers double every
five years. It is forecast that this figure will rise to 7 million by 2005.
According to a study based on 1995 figures, 492,809 students attend 561
imam-preacher lyceums in Turkey, and 53,553 students graduate from these
schools each year. Meanwhile, the demand for imams is only 2,288 per year.
The remaining 51,345 graduates are deliberately trained in schools of law
and in the political sciences and in police academies. The purpose of that
is to build an Islamist state structure, within the context of political
Islam, by occupying government positions over the short and medium terms.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>The donors of financial assistance to Islamist organizations
include Islamist individuals whose shares of the national income are among
highest in the country. The wealth status of these individuals, who are
publicly known as the “100 political Islamist bosses,” is as follows: six
are worth more than 100 trillion Turkish lira; five are worth between 20
and 50 trillion Turkish lira; 15 are worth between 10 and 20 trillion Turkish
lira; 13 are worth between 1 and 10 trillion Turkish lira; the rest are
worth less than 1 trillion Turkish lira.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>The propaganda activities are conducted through 19 newspapers,
110 magazines, 51 radio stations, and 20 television stations.</font></li>

<font size=-1>In the last election it did not manage to pass the 10 percent
threshold.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Kemal Kirisci has predicted this outcome already in March
1998. “With the exception of a hard core ideologically motivated Refah
voters I suspect the others will move to the many other political parties
they can choose from,” he told an academic roundtable on Turkey. See <i>MERIA</i>

Greek lyceum in Istanbul, causing material damage; 17 October - a bomb
exploded in front of a bookstore in Istanbul selling the publications of
the Religious Affairs Foundation; 21 October - Ahmet Taner Kislali, a former
minister, academic and newspaper columnist, was killed outside his home
Ankara by a home-made pipe bomb placed on top of his car; 29 October -
a time-bomb exploded in the campus of the University of Marmara in Goztepe
district of Istanbul, causing minor damage; 18 November - unidentified
assailants damaged pictures of Kemal Ataturk and planted a pipe-bomb in
the Istanbul headquarters of the Ataturk Association.</font></li>

<font size=-1>For instance 23 members of Hizbullah were captured in October
1998 in operations launched in central Malatya Province. Ten members of
the “scientists” group of Hizbullah have been captured in December in an
operation conducted in Batman. They were reportedly involved in murders
and cases of extortion.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>In June 1999, some 30 militants, including four policemen,
of the “Vasat Group” of Hizbullah were captured in an operation carried
out in Malatya; 10 members of Hizbullah were captured in the Batman province;
8 militants of Hizbullah were captured in Kovancilar county of eastern
Elazig province.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>In Erzurum, a total of 14 persons have been detained on grounds
that they aided the Menzil group. In operations conducted in Agri, the
security forces caught 28 Hizbullah militants, including the five members
of the “Province Council.” Security officials reported that the Hizbullah
members - which began organizing in the region since the early 1990’s -
from time to time also undertake activities in Turkey’s other provinces.</font></li>

<font size=-1>Three Iranian officers are training some 200 PKK militants
in a camp set up by the PKK in the Piransehir district in Iran. In another
camp named Jerme, 70 PKK terrorists are being trained. It has been found
out that Iran is planning to have all these militants infiltrate Turkey
to stage terrorist attacks. It has also been ascertained that the districts
of Maku and Dambak in Iran serve as the PKK’s military depots and that
personnel and materiel are sent from here to the PKK groups that are active
in Turkey. Osman Ocalan, Nizamettin Tas, and Mustafa Karasu, who are among
the PKK leaders, are now in Iran. See Istanbul <i>Hurriyet</i>, 17 May

<font size=-1>The well-known French commentator Alain Gresh also asserts
that “Contrary to what people think in the Arab world, in particular in
Damascus, the impetus of the alliance does not come from Israel, but from
the Turkish generals.” See Alain Gresh,<b><font color="#800000"> “</font></b>Grandes
Manoeuvres R&eacute;gionales Autour De L’alliance Isra&eacute;lo-Turque,”

Monde Diplomatique</i>, <a href="../index.html">D&eacute;cembre 1997</a>.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>The conflict between the two camps and strategies regarding
the future foreign policy of Iran has found an echo even in the Iranian
academic circles, which are well aware of the discrepancy between the regime’s
ideology and the constraints of the international and internal realities.
See for instance the publication of the revealing round-table discussion
between Dr. Ebrahim Mottaqi, assistant professor of political science at
the Univ. of Tehran, Dr. Dehshiri, member of the faculty of “Allameh Tabataba’i”
Univ. and Dr. Javat Eta’at, the head of the<font face="Miriam"> </font>Research
Division of the Center of Islamic Revolution Documents, in Tehran <i>Salam</i>
of 11 August 1997. It is interesting to note that in this professional,
theoretical discussion on the Iranian foreign policy Turkey is one of the
very few countries mentioned by name and in this context Dr. Eta’at proposes
a policy to confront it and put it in a reactive position by striving to
a “reverse alliance” with one of its neighbors.</font></li>
