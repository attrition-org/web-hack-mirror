<td WIDTH="60%"><b>Introduction</b>
<p>The attempts to achieve tangible cooperation between Arab states in
the field of counter-terrorism stretch back to the beginning of the 1990s.
For most of the Arab states, the task would seem to involve major difficulties—mutual
suspicion, differences in ideology and the regime. But above all other
difficulties is the delicacy needed to deal with Islamic fundamentalist
or radical movements, some of which are terrorist groups or give inspiration
to such terrorism.&nbsp;</td>

<p>The Islamic opposition and terrorist groups have filled a vacuum in
Arab society—a vacuum caused by the weakness of the Arab Left and Pan-Arabist
ideology since the mid-1970s, the decline of Palestinian nationalistic
terrorism in the 1990s and the changes in inter-Arab policies after the
fall of the Soviet Union. The rise of Islamist terrorism as part of anti-Western
warfare confronts the Arab states with yet another obstacle; the Islamist
vs. modern context to the <i>Jihad</i> implies a definite cultural war
against modernity.
<p>Another problem facing the Arab states is the popularity of Islamist
ideas among large portions of their public. This is not necessarily a support
of the content of these ideas. Rather it is a mass protest against the
Arab regimes based on a variety of reasons. Thus among the Arab regimes
there are conflicting interests which stand in the way of better cooperation—or
any cooperation at all—in the fight against the Islamists. In addition
in some states the Islamic official establishment, or parts of it, support
some of the Islamist groups. This leads to further erosion in the fight
against them and can lead to a conflict of interest between various elements
and forces in the same state.
<p>But it seems that above all there is the problem of the definition of
terrorism in the Arab world. In particular there is the need to reach a
definition that includes religiously motivated terrorism, while at the
same time does not contradict the support of some Arab states of terrorism
against Israel. It seems also difficult to achieve one accepted definition
of Islamist terrorism. This problem highlights the different ways in which
some countries regard to such terror in their own states and the other
Arab states. One state may oppress the Islamist terror groups and even
the Islamic opposition in its own territory, while giving refuge and even
support to other Islamic groups in other Arab states—primarily if these
groups fight against Israel or the United States. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood
was cruelly oppressed by the Syrian regime. However their colleagues in
Hamas, their sister movement, has an office in Damascus that directs terror
activity against Israel. Various Gulf states support Islamist groups in
the Arab world while oppressing their own Islamists at home. The Islamic
regime in the Sudan has also been a source of support for various Islamist
groups in other Arab states.
<p>All these contradictions, plus the delicate issue of confronting Islamic
religious ideas, make it difficult to reach an accepted and really implemented
Arab accord of counter- terrorism.
<p><b>Progress thus far</b>
<p>In 1992 several Arab states, primarily Egypt and Saudi Arabia, alarmed
by the rise of political violence began discussing closer cooperation in
this field. However the Arab coalition against the Iraqis during and after
the Gulf war in 1991, and the question of assistance to Muslim states by
foreign "infidel" powers, prevented the success of these talks. The growing
American involvement in the Middle East and the Arab world has added to
this problematical issue by arousing the sympathy of Arab publics to the
anti-Western notions of the Islamists.
<p>On March 1996, under the initiative of the Clinton administration a
global summit against terrorism was held in Sharm al-Sheikh, in which 14
Arab states took part. All the participants signed a communiqu&eacute;
that condemned "all acts of terror in all abhorrent forms, whatever its
perpetrators, including the recent attacks in Israel…"
<p>However progress in the quest for cooperation came only at the beginning
of 1998, as a direct consequence of the Islamist massacre in Luxor in Egypt,
and the inhuman massacres of innocent citizens in Algeria. Under the initiative
of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, in January 1998 Arab Interior ministers of 20
Arab states agreed seriously for the first time to enhance cooperation
to fight terrorism, and even to call on "foreign states" to cooperate with
Arab security services.
<p>The Arab Interior Ministers approved a draft for an Arab accord, which
was kept secret and not released to the Media. A joint statement of the
meeting cited "the aim of reinforcing controls to prevent infiltration
of terrorist elements through the borders and entry points to Arab states,
and facilitate procedures for the extradition of those accused of crimes
of terrorism." The agreement was meant to be signed in April 1998.
<p>One element remained as an obstacle then and now: the inability to reach
a common view and definition of terrorism. A persistent motive in the negotiations
on the issue was the view that freedom fighters were not terrorists, which
made the situation more complicated. The draft of the Arab anti-terrorism
agreement emphasized "the right of people to struggle against foreign occupation
and aggression with all means, including armed struggle, to liberate their
land and win their right to self-determination and independence." This
statement, which at first sight seemed to perfectly fit the support of
the Palestinians, ignored the fact that the PLO and the Palestinian national
leadership had officially abandoned the use of terrorism five years earlier.
It ignored the fact that the Palestinian "armed struggle" is now in the
hands of the Palestinian Islamists, the colleagues of the same Islamist
Arab terrorist groups fighting against the Arab states.
<p>Several days after this meeting an extraordinary session of the Council
of Arab ministers of Tourism and dedicated to the condemnation of terrorism
was held in Cairo, in the wake of the Luxor terrorist incident. The Lebanese
Tourism minister Nicola Fattoush, a Christian, warned that "the erroneous
link established between terrorism and Islam was harmful to Arab tourism
and culture. He added that several countries, including the United States
have exploited internal conflicts in Arab countries to give a distorted
picture of Arab and Muslim culture, and to misrepresent our just cause."
He denounced "Western countries giving terrorists shelter and protection
while condemning Arab freedom fighters as terrorists and murderers."[1]
<p><b>The April 1998 agreement</b>
<p>On April 22<sup>nd</sup> 1998, the Interior and Justice Ministers of
the 22 Arab States within the League of Arab States signed for the first
time, an accord to fight Terrorism and Extremism. The Secretary of the
League described the accord as a unique achievement. The accord was not
published in full text, but the Qatari newspaper <i>Al-Ayam</i> has published
its main principles and terms on April 23<sup>rd</sup> 1998:

<p>This accord was achieved after intensive discussions on different levels,
at the initiative of the Egyptian regime. It was aimed mainly against radical
and fundamentalist Islamist terrorism, which is partially assisted by various
Arab states.
<p>An interesting point in the accord was the fact that there was no procedure
to arrive at common judicial rules or to create a common judicial institution.
Rather the emphasis was on the judicial independence of every state. There
was
also no procedure to build a common apparatus for Counter-Terrorism, such
as were established in the past for the coordination of the war against
Israel or the economic Arab boycott over Israel. This was probably due
to an absence of Arab unity in the 1990s and the differences of opinion
among the various states concerning Islamic Law.
<p>The only reference here to Israel was the differentiation between terrorism
and the struggle against occupation. It gave legitimacy to Palestinian
Islamic terrorism against Israel by groups that some of them were colleagues
of terrorist groups in the Arab states or sponsored by other Arab regimes.
<p>The only importance this accord had was in the fact that it was signed
after so long a debate.
<p><b>Arab criticism of the Accord</b>
<p>Parts of the accord were also published by The Arab Center for the Independence
of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP), which sharply criticized
the accord from the point of view of human rights.
<br>The ACIJLP claimed that the agreement included the expansion of cooperation
between Arab security apparatuses in order to besiege what they called
"the phenomenon of terrorism." Most of the Arab ministers of Interior asserted
this following the signing of the agreement. And according to the preamble
of the agreement, it aimed at "confronting terrorist crimes threatening
the security and stability of the Arab nation, and constituting a danger
to its vital interests."
<br>The ACIJLP complained that the agreement had unjustifiably expanded
the notion of terrorist crimes, and that it constituted a threat to Arab
citizens' rights to freedom and personal security through its expansion
of the rights of Arab governments regarding the preventive custody of citizens
of Arab countries signing the agreement.
<p>The following is a summary of the ACIJLP's commentary and remarks on
the text of the Agreement:
<p>1. The definition of "terrorism" in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article One
of the agreement is too broad and loose; it considers as terrorist <b>"any
act of violence or threat to use it, regardless of its causes and motives
taking place in implementation of an individual or collective criminal
project, and aiming at terrifying people, harming them, or exposing their
lives, freedom or security to danger."</b>
<p>It is clear that this loose definition is wide enough to include all
cases of violence or the threat to use it, from simple fights between citizens,
through what is currently described in Egypt as thuggery, and up to terrorism
aimed at endangering the integrity of society. This is clear from the expression
<b>"regardless
of its causes and motives."</b>
<p>The Agreement has even expanded the definition of terrorism beyond its
definition in some internal legislation in Arab states which signing the
accord. One example is Egypt in which law 97 of 1992—an addition to the
Penal Code—defines terrorism as: <b>"Every use of force, violence, threatening,
or terrification, resorted to by the culprit in the implementation of a
collective or individual criminal project, aiming at disrupting the public
order or exposing Society's integrity and security to danger; and resulting
in: harming individuals, terrifying them or exposing their lives, freedom
or security to danger; damaging the environment; damaging means of communication
or transportation, money, buildings, public or private belongings, or occupying
them; prohibiting or constraining the work of public authorities, worship
places or academic institutes; or obstructing the application of the Constitution,
laws or regulations."</b>
<p>The definition of terrorism in the agreement is much broader than its
counterpart in this law, despite the various criticisms directed at the
latter in Egypt.
<p>2. The definition of a terrorist crime is—unfortunately—no better than
that of the definition of terrorism. The former is defined as <b>"any crime
or attemped crime committed in implementation of a terrorist motive in
any of the contractor states." </b>This means that every terrorist act
in the former paragraph is considered a terrorist crime. There is thus
nearly no difference between the definition of terrorism and that of a
terrorist crime—except that the latter is an application of the former.
<p>At the same time, this paragraph, in its description of a crime, equated
the act and the attempt, something possibly enabling the governments signing
this Agreement to attack their political opponents' freedom by accusing
them of attempting terrorist crimes, an accusation not requiring any acts
to support it. These governments' task of harming their opponents through
such accusations is thus being facilitated.
<p>3. The Agreement negates freedom of opinion and expression, and peaceful
democratic opposition under the pretext of terrorism. Paragraph (b) of
Article Two stipulates that <b>"none of the terrorist crimes referred to
in the previous article is to be considered a political crime. And in the
application of this Agreement, the following crimes are not to be considered
political crimes, even if they have political motivations:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Assaults on the kings and presidents of the contractor states, as well
as their wives or relatives.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Assaults on heir apparent, vice-presidents, Prime ministers or ministers
in any of the contractor states…"</b></li>
</ul>
The ACIJLP considers that this formulation constitutes a serious danger
threatening the security of Arab citizens, and particularly opinion holders,
journalists, political oppositionists, people concerned with public work
and those active in parties, unions, and civil society institutions. According
to this paragraph, the mere expression of opinion, objection or critique
of some actions, positions or opinions of heads of states or their relatives
might be considered an assault.
<br>The lack in the Agreement of any definition of "assault" permits act,
saying, signal or even insinuation to be considered a (terrorist) crime
of assault. This not only threatens the right of Arab citizens to freedom
of opinion and expression, but also clearly constitutes a threat to all
political oppositionists, party activists, and people involved in democratic
political work in the states signing the Agreement.
<p>4. The Agreement Threatens the Right of Arab citizens to Freedom and
Personal Security (Articles 25-27). Article 25/1 of the Agreement <b>allows
the judicial authorities in a contractor state to request from another
contractor state—through any written means of communication—to hold a person
in preventive custody until the arrival of the extradition request.</b>
<p>The ACIJLP thinks that this formulation is a direct threat to the freedom
of Arab citizens, as it doesn't require the attachment of any investigations
or photocopies of any judicial orders or causes to such an expeditious
request to hold a citizen in preventive custody. The mere reception of
a written form (fax, telex or e-mail) is sufficient to imprison any citizen.
<br>Article 25/2 also stipulates that in this case, <b>the state receiving
the preventive custody request can hold the requested person in preventive
custody for 30 days; if the extradition request, accompanied by the necessary
documents referred to in the previous article, was not presented, it is
impermissible to imprison the requested person for more than 30 days.</b>
<p>This means that this illegal preventive custody—based merely on a written
note rather than a judicial warrant—can last for a whole month.
<p>5. Despite the fact that Article 25 specifies the maximum period of
holding a person in preventive custody to be 30 days, stipulating the necessity
of releasing the person at the end of this period if the extradition request
was not presented or not accompanied by the necessary documents, Article
27 extends the period of preventive custody to 60 days without an accepted
justification.
<p>6. Article 27/3 stipulates that: <b>"Release does not prevent re-arresting
the person and extraditing him, if the extradition request was received
later."</b>
<p>The ACIJLP estimates that this formulation allows the repetition of
periods of preventive custody for Arab citizens (60 additional days) following
the arrival of the extradition request of a person who has been released
due to not receiving the necessary documents, under the pretext that the
latter have arrived, even though it remains possible that the new request
may be lacking these (claimed) documents.
<br>All this opens the door for Arab governments signing the Agreement
to harass their political opponents by using preventive custody for long
periods as virtual detention.
<p>7. The Agreement Attacks the Judicial Authority and Nullifies Many Guaranties
for Citizens (Article 31/3). Article 31/3 stipulates that <b>"it is possible
to direct the judicial delegation request directly from the judicial bodies,
to the competent body in the requested state; and the replies can be sent
directly through the latter body."</b>
<p>The ACIJLP considers that, to begin with, there is a clear contradiction
between Articles 11 and 31 dealing with delegation among the contractor
states within the territory of a state in which a terrorist act takes place.
This contradiction relates to some important procedures of primary investigation
effecting the freedom of citizens, such as seizure of letters, search and
arrest.
<p>8. Article 11 requires the implementation of the delegation request
in accordance with the internal law of the requested state, while Article
31 allows the state requesting delegation to bypass the internal law (which
requires the issuing of the judicial delegation request from the locally
competent judicial body) by granting it the right to address directly the
administrative body, or even several administrative bodies in the requested
state, in accordance with the judgment of the judicial body of the requesting
state. This means overriding the standards of operation of judicial and
executive bodies in the states signing the Agreement.
<p>The ACIJLP asserts that this formulation enables ministries of justice
in states signing the Agreement to address directly ministries of interior
in other Arab states for instance, thus overriding the competent judicial
bodies. This constitutes on assault on the competent judicial authorities
in the requested states, as well as the safeguards of those persons requested
for extradition or for the implementation of certain measures against them.
These safeguards entail that such measures can only be undertaken through
the competent judicial bodies.
<p>We can also add that this contradicts most Arab constitutions which
assert that it is inadmissible to violate the personal freedom of citizens
through arrest, search, imprisonment or constraining freedom in any way
except through a grounded order of a competent judicial body; or to violate
the sanctity of the private life of those citizens through confiscating
or scrutinizing their mail, phone calls or any other means of communication
except through a grounded judicial order and for a limited period. Examples
can be found in Articles 41, 44 and 45 of the Egyptian Constitution, Article
30 of the Constitution of Kuwait Article 19 of the Constitution of Bahrain,
Article 7 of the Constitution of Jordan, article 8 of the Constitution
of Lebanon, Article 32 of the Constitution of Yemen, and Article 25 (a)
of the Syrian Constitution.
<p>In addition, the above mentioned formulation constitutes a clear retreat
from the text of Article 31/1 of the agreement requiring that the judicial
delegation request be directed from the ministry of justice of the requesting
state to the ministry of justice of the requested state, and that the reply
takes the same route.
<p>Finally, the above mentioned formulation of that paragraph in Article
31 of the agreement raises the suspicion of the direct use, by ministries
of justice in the requesting states, of the executive bodies of other Arab
states for the harassment of political opponents and oppositionists, abundant
in Arab states.
<p>To sum up, the ACIJLP is expressing its serious worries regarding the
formulation of those texts, and their practical application. One factor
amplifying the ACIJLP's worries is that those texts are the product of
ten years of common Arab action by Arab ministers of interior and justice.
We thus have to rule out the notion that the loose and unspecific formulations
are the result of shortcomings of discussions and deliberations. Instead
we have to assume that the texts were intentionally formulated and confirmed
in this way in order to use them in the protection of the security of the
governments of the Arab states signing the agreement.[2]
<p>One of the Arab states that enthusiastically joined the signing of the
agreement was Syria, which for some years has sought to get off the American
State Department's list of the states sponsoring terrorism. Following the
agreement, the Syrian Minister of Justice said that the anti-terrorism
agreement has "confirmed to the world that the Arab states rejected terrorism
as a goal or a method, and adhered to international resolutions to achieve
people's right to self determination and armed struggle against foreign
occupying forces."
<p>He added that the signing of the agreement was "an indication of the
nation's position of rejecting terrorism as related to Arab heritage in
the "prophets' land," and that this position proved that "terrorism was
not natural nor legitimate."
<p>Later it was made clear that Syria had been one of the states that stressed
the need for the agreement to allow for the rights of individuals to resist
occupation such as in Southern Lebanon, the Golan Heights and the Palestinian
territories, without being labeled as terrorists. The Syrian minister did
not forget to mention that "the Arab states were still exposed to hideous
and strong forms of terrorism by Israeli killing of children and women."[3]
<p><b>The Interpol Convention</b>
<p>In October 1998, several months after the explosions at the American
embassies in Naand Dar as-Salam, the 67<sup>th</sup> session of the general
assembly of the International criminal police organization, Interpol, was
held in Cairo, with the participation of representatives from 150 countries.
The session was convened to discuss means of fighting all types of crimes
that required international cooperation, especially terrorism. The Egyptian
authorities said that "convening the conference in Cairo was important
evidence that stressed the confidence placed by the international community
in the stable security conditions in Egypt, one year after the attack in
Luxor." The Egyptian minister of Interior Habib al-'Adli, concentrated
in his speech on terrorism, saying that "terrorism has become a grave threat
to human rights and to people's interests, to values of democratic societies
and their political systems."[4]
<p>But, for the Arab states there was still the problem of the Palestinians
and the definition of their struggle, even though at that time the only
terrorism was Islamist Palestinian terrorism by Hamas and the Palestinian
Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The secretary general of Arab Interior ministers'
Council, Dr. Ahmad bin Muhammad Salem, emphasized in his speech the necessity
to differentiate between terrorism, which should be combated and condemned,
and "the right of people to engage in legal armed struggle for liberating
their lands and restoring its usurped rights."[5]
<p>The Egyptian delegation presented a point of view of dealing with terrorism
as a criminal offence and not a political crime. After long discussions,
109 of the 150 participating delegations supported the Egyptian viewpoint.[6]
<p>Following the convention in Cairo, Ahmad bin Muhammad el-Salem, expressed
his pleasure at the gains achieved by the Arab states through the coordination
that took place among members of the Arab group.
<p>In a statement issued by the Arab Bureau for Security Information, he
said that "the newly issued statement concerning terrorism, called the
"Cairo Declaration for Combating Terrorism," matched the contents of the
statement issued by the Arab foreign ministers earlier that year condemning
terrorism." He noted "the importance of enhancing judicial and police cooperation
among member countries to guarantee the delivery of fugitive terrorists
and not to use any country's territories to launch, administrate or finance
terrorist operations."[7]
<p>In November 1998, the Council of Arab Justice Ministers decided to form
a joint ministerial committee, chaired by Saudi Interior minister Prince
Naef bin Abd al- 'Aziz, to establish a draft of executive measures for
Arab anti-terrorism agreement in the security and judicial domains.
<p><b>The anti-terrorist pact</b>
<p>On January 30-31<sup>st</sup>, 1999, the Council of Arab Interior Ministers
held its 16th meeting in Amman in an effort to consolidate a united policy
of counter-terrorism, and to reaffirm the declaration of Arab counter-terrorism
accords from April 1998. The Council issued a general statement "rejecting
terrorism in all its forms," and undertook to "make any effort to fight
terrorism." They also gave their backing to an international conference
to be held under the auspices of the United Nations. The statement distinguished
between "terrorism and the right of people to struggle against foreign
occupation and aggression by all means including the armed struggle."
<p>An important part of the statement was the "promise to furnish all necessary
aid to the Palestinian police," and the agreement that "every state will
separately coordinate its support for the Palestinian police with Arafat."
<p>The discussions of the meeting were closed to the Media and there was
very little information about it in the Arab Media. One exceptional was
the weekly <i>Al-Sabil</i>, the organ of the Jordanian Muslim Brothers
and prominent supporter of Hamas. (8)
<p>The interest of the Islamic movements in this meeting was obvious, because
terrorism in our period in the Arab World means mainly various Islamic
organizations and groups, which are acting in the framework of an Islamist
fundamentalist or radical terrorism. The Islamic weekly therefore put its
emphasize on the disputes between various Arab states in this meeting.
<p>According to <i>Al-Sabil</i>, many states, headed by Syria, had expressed
disagreement with the accord, especially in regard to the extradition of
criminals from one state to another. Thus there were only 7 Arab states
that signed the accords: Jordan, The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Algeria,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Sudan, plus the Palestinian Authority. According
to <i>Al-Sabil</i>, only five states have expressed their approval of the
accords to the General Secretariat of the Council of Arab Ministers of
Interior.
<p>Observers have pointed out that although the last meeting had stated
"the right of people to struggle against occupation and aggression," there
was no regard to Israel or "Israeli terrorism," in contrast to the previous
convention on April 1998. Dr. Ahmad al-Salem, Secretary General of the
Council said in a press conference that the condemnation of terrorism by
the meeting "included all the countries that initiate terrorism."
<p>Another disputed issue of this meeting was the definition of terrorism,
even though the Arab Interior ministers had reached back in 1989, at their
meeting in Tunis, the following definition:
<blockquote>"Terrorism is every organized act of violence or threatening
by violence that causes terror and fear, such as killing, assassination,
kidnapping of hostages, airplanes or ships, and the use of bombing, aimed
to achieve political targets."</blockquote>
The Islamic weekly obviously viewed with great antagonism and anxiety the
special article in the decisions of the ministers of Interior concerning
the support for the Palestinian police. They naturally viewed this article
as aimed against Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic groups. This Arab support
was on the background of the arrests of hundreds of Hamas activists since
1998 and the American involvement in the Palestinian counter-terrorism
as a consequence of the Wye River Accord. Another source reported that
a decision was made by the participants "to furnish all necessary aid to
the Palestinian police operating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Each
country separately would agree on its support for the police with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat."[9]
<p>By the beginning of 1999, the Arab Anti-Terrorism Pact of April 1998,
was ratified by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates and the Palestinian Authority. In May 1999, Jordan joined the
ratification to be the Seventh Arab state out of 22, and hence it was put
into actual implementation as was required by the agreement. Later on,
Tunisia became the eighth state to ratified the Accord. In a statement
of the Council of Arab Interior ministers on May 6<sup>th</sup> 1999, the
Arab Ministers of Interior cited the entry into force of the agreement
as "a great landmark in the battle against the horrific and dangerous phenomenon
of terrorism." It also hailed the agreement as a "step towards restoring
the true image of Islam, which calls for tolerance and renounces all forms
of violence and terrorism carried out by minorities in the name of Islam."[10]
<p>At the end of July 1999, an anti-terrorism convention of 10 Arab ministers
was held in Jeddah to discuss the implementation of the agreement. The
participants were the Interior Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria,
Algeria, Yemen and Egypt, and the Justice Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Iraq and Morocco.
<p>In a final statement published by the Saudi Press Agency, the convention
had "anxiously followed the developments in terrorism from which the whole
world is suffering. The fight against terrorism is the duty of the whole
international community and needs tight and permanent cooperation between
different countries." The delegates urged Arab states to make "bilateral
accords in the fight against terrorism with foreign countries, which will
help pursue the terrorists and deliver them to their countwhere they will
be tried."[11]
<p>The statement stressed the difference between "terrorism and the right
of people to fight against a foreign occupation and aggression by all means,
including an armed struggle."
<p>Prince Naef bin Abd al-Aziz the Saudi Interior Minister, announced that
"terrorism has no country and no religion. Its danger spills over frontiers
and it is not possible for any country to wipe out the phenomenon by acting
alone, however rich it is." He added that "the Arab convention on the fight
against terrorism is inspired by Islamic law, and its ratification reflects
our desire and determination to struggle against this phenomenon in the
Arab World and to cooperate with other countries."
<p>The Arab ministers also decided to form a committee of experts to devise
a mechanism for implementing the agreement. The committee will report to
the next Arab ministers' conference to be convened later this year in Algeria.
<p>The most enthusiastic commentary on the convention and the agreement
came from the Egyptian official press, which cited the past pronouncements
of President Husni Mubarak on the issue. The Egyptian daily <i>Al-Akhbar</i>
wrote in its editorial among other things:
<blockquote>"Although gradually fading out from the Arab region, terrorism
is an international phenomenon that continues to agonize the world. It
is a mindless monster that seeks to destroy life as we treasure it, with
everything sacred in it as well. This mindless monster is also trying to
devour the very elements of progress and development bestowed upon us by
God… The signing of the unified Arab anti-terrorism agreement and the approval
of the strategy of exchanging information and extraditing criminals have
been applauded as a step in the right direction towards uprooting this
destructive phenomenon… The countries that embrace and support terrorism
are in fact, playing with fire, and they are bound to be burned at a time
when regret will do them no good…"[12]</blockquote>
The words sounds like a religious warning intended for the ears of the
heretics.
<p>An interesting commentary to the agreement was given by the Iranian
Broadcasting Network in English on August 1<sup>st</sup> 1999. The commentator
was very doubtful as to the active results of the convention: "Observers
however, remain doubtful whether the Arab states will be able to suppress
their opponents by just labeling them all terrorists. The opponents of
some governments are being supported by other Arab states." He also emphasized
the poor prospects of cooperation between states like Iraq, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait. He ends his commentary by stating that "It becomes clear that
there exists deep difference between the Arab states and Western governments
and between the Arab states and their opponents over the definition of
terrorism."[13]
<p><b>Conclusions</b>
<p>The long period over which the Arab States struggled to reach an agreement
on cooperation in the fight against terrorism emphasizes the difficulties
they face in achieving a joint policy on counter-terrorism. The main obstacle
is the view of Islamic terrorist activity. On one hand, there are active
groups of Islamists that have some popular support as well as backing by
an Islamic atmosphere of political and social protest created by large
non-violent Islamic movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas.
On the other hand in recent years there is a feeling of a global Western-Islamic
warfare, initiated by the Islamists, which prevents Arab States from openly
identifying with the Western fight against terrorism.
<p>What seems to have changed is probably the phenomenon of the "Afghan
Veterans," and the collaboration between Osamah bin Ladin and several of
the most extremist Egyptian, Algerian, Yemeni, Jordanian and Palestinian
Islamist terrorist groups, wanted in their own countries for involvement
in severe terrorism. This phenomenon, plus the cruelty of the large-scale
terrorism in Algeria, brought about a greater willingness for cooperation,
both internationally and on the Arab arena. This willingness—though not
yet a real cooperation—may also be a consequence of the increased cooperation
of some Arab states with the American intelligence community. In addition
there is the American involvement both in counter-terrorist operations
against its interests and facilities in Arab countries, and in assisting
Arab states to fight terrorism, such as in the cases of Egypt, the Palestinian
Authority and Jordan.
<p>A major obstacle to better cooperation lies in the arena of minorities
fighting for independence or self-determination, such as the Palestinians
and in recent years the Turkish Kurds. During all the negotiations and
discussions over the issue of counter- terrorism, there was always the
demand to distinguish between "terrorist crime" and "political crime."
The agreement made a distinction between the two, but without clearly defining
the political one. It also specified that extradition will not be automatic
in the case of "political crimes," if the country harboring the accused
feels that the accused are being pursued for political reasons.
<p>The prospects for full Arab cooperation in this field are not high,
among other reasons, because of common suspicion among the various regimes.
But there has been some improvement over the last year, which lead to the
signing of the agreement and its ratification by the major Arab states
suffering from Islamist terrorism. We have also to bear in mind that in
some Arab states the persistence of the authorities in fighting terrorism
has lead to second thoughts among some of the terrorist groups as to whether
to continue their terrorist activity. In the case of Egypt and Algeria,
the authorities succeeded in achieving a kind of cease-fire with Islamist
groups, in return for the release of thousands of prisoners.
<p>Thus some progress has been made in individual states with or without
the cooperation of other states.
