<P><IMG SRC="../graphics/turkey2.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=205 WIDTH=297 ALIGN=RIGHT>The last few weeks have witnessed a wave of terrorist attacks throughout
Turkey, some of them the most deadly in years, recalling the dark days
of the 1980s:



<ul>
<li>
28 February - 17 people were injured when a hand grenade was thrown into
a coffeehouse in Istanbul. In another attack in the city seven buses were
firebombed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
March 4<sup>th</sup> - a Kurdish suicide bomber killed herself and wounded
three civilians outside a police station in southeastern Turkey. Local
officials said they believe the bomber was a Kurdish guerrilla protesting
the capture of Abdullah Ocalan. The bombing took place in the town of Batman,
the scene of a shootout between Ocalan supporters and police two weeks
earlier. The Batman bombing was the first suicide attack since Turkish
commandos captured Ocalan in Kenya on Feb. 15.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The same day four people died and the local governor was seriously wounded
in a car bomb attack in the central Turkish town of Cankiri. Maoist guerrillas
claimed responsibility for the attack.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
March 10 - A time bomb exploded in a taxi on a busy shopping street in
Turkey's commercial capital Istanbul, killing the driver and injuring eight
passers-by. The far-left Turkish Workers and Peasants Liberation Army (TIKKO)
telephoned newspapers claiming responsibility for the blast. The organization
was believed to be also responsible for the attack in Cankiri.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Hours later a second explosion ripped through parked cars in another shopping
area in the same part of the city. There were no reports of any injuries.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The following day explosives experts defused two bombs in Istanbul: a pipe
bomb found near naval facilities on the European side of the city and another
explosive device in the yard of a car dealership on the Asian side.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
March 13 - attackers set a crowded six-story department store on fire,
killing at least 13 people in one of Turkey's deadliest attacks in years.
It was not clear if the assailants forced people upstairs with their guns,
poured gasoline in the building and set it on fire, or if the blaze began
after they hurled firebombs from a car in front of the store.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The following day a bomb blast under a truck in Istanbul killed at least
one person and wounded five others. Explosive experts defused a second
bomb planted inside a crowded Burger King fast-food restaurant on the outskirts
of the city.</li>
</ul>
It should be noted that Kurdish militants, extremist leftist groups and
militant Islamic groups are all active in Istanbul, a city of 12 million
people. Firebombings are common in the city, but they usually target empty
parked vehicles or banks at night.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>A medley of organizations and policies</font></b></center>
<P>Besides the PKK and the weakened Islamic terrorist groups (such as the
Turkish Hizballah) two more extremist leftist organizations were active
in Turkey during the last few years. The first of these was the Revolutionary
People’s Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), a spin-off of Dev-Sol, Turkey’s
most deadly urban leftist guerrilla group (Revolutionary Left). The second
group is the Turkish Workers and Peasants Liberation Army (TIKKO), which
has recently reappeared in the news in connection with the latest wave
of attacks.

<P><B>TIKKO and the PKK, strange bedfellows</B>
<BR>TIKKO has been targeting soldiers, policemen and village chiefs in
the Tunceli (Dersim) province since the 1970s. Since the mid 1990s its
activity has been limited due to an internal feud and the deaths of leaders
in clashes with the Turkish army. Said Cuneyt Kahraman—who took over leadership
of the group in 1996 after the former leader was killed by fellow rebels
for suspected collaboration with state forces—was killed in March 1997.

<P>Although the PKK and TIKKO eventually came into ideological conflict—with
TIKKO backing a class war, while the PKK advocated a national struggle—both
organizations had guerrilla training camps in Lebanon’s Syrian-controlled
Bekaa valley in the 1980s.

<P>According to a PKK political militant cited by Reuters (March 11, 1999),
there is an agreement between the PKK and TIKKO which originated in the
Tunceli area in the summer of 1998. According to this information the two
groups immediately launched coordinated ambushes on security forces in
the rugged mountainous terrain of Tunceli province.

<P>Turkish security sources claim that TIKKO, which had some 100 armed
guerrillas at the beginning of 1997, currently maintains as few as 70 militants
in the mountains of Tunceli.

<P><B>The Revolutionary Left</B>
<BR>The DHKP/C, which is a much older and structured organization, an offspring
of Turkey’s urban leftist guerrilla group Dev-Sol of the 1970s and 1980s,
also had a protocol of alliance with the PKK. The protocol was signed in
December 1996 and was intended to build “The Revolutionary Front” and become
“a source of fear for the oligarchy, and happiness and new hope for democrats
and revolutionaries.”

<P>In fact, the DHKP/C acknowledged in the spring of 1998 that the great
expectations from the protocol were never fulfilled and accused the PKK
for the failure. According to this DHKP/C document the PKK do not participate
in any partnership unless they are in control. Nor do they particularly
care for equality between partners.

<P>After the one-sided cease-fire proclaimed by the PKK in September 1998,
the DHKP/C accused Ocalan of defeatism and acceptance of the Kemalist ideology
and the Turkish’ state conditions for surrender.

<P><B>The PKK: on the offensive and in a state of flux</B>
<BR>Osman Ocalan, the brother of Abdullah Ocalan, declared to the German
<I>Der Stern</I> that the PKK intends to continue the armed struggle in
Turkey. “We are now forced to rely on a violent solution,” Osman Ocalan
told the magazine (March 11, 1999, Itar-Tass).

<P>Osman Ocalan threatened to stage revenge actions all over Turkey in
reply to the reprisals against his brother Abdullah: “Popular uprisings
will erupt in Turkish cities” and “the Kurds will girdle themselves with
explosives and blow up together with Turkish soldiers.”

<P>On March 8, 1999 the PKK Central Committee issued a statement about
its 6th Congress attended by 300 delegates and held in “Kurdistan.” The
statement warned “all Turkish state officials, civilian and military, for
the last time: current measures being taken against our party leader must
be immediately halted and he must be addressed as the leader of our people.
If the current situation persists, those responsible will be subjected
to similar measures by us.”

<P>The situation in South Kurdistan (Northern Iraq) received particular
attention at the Congress. A decision was made to carry out all activities
in the region under the title PKK Basur (South). The Congress also decided
to reorganize its guerrilla units based in Turkey, first and foremost in
the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions, under the name of the People’s
Liberation Army of Anatolia.

<P>In addition, the Congress resolved to reorganize the political front
organization, ERNK, “from top to bottom to ensure that popular protests
and uprisings are developed and intensified to a level able to defeat the
enemy.” The Congress emphasized the importance of the guerrilla army, pledging
to wage a “real guerrilla war” in the coming period.

<P>At the Congress Abdullah Ocalan was unanimously re-elected President.
But Osman, his brother, did not rule out the possibility that one of the
PKK founders, namely Cemil Bayik, could become the party’s new leader.
“I am ready to fight under him if such a decision was made,” Ocalan pointed
out to <I>Der Stern</I>.

<P>According to the Istanbul <I>Milliyet</I> a meeting of the PKK had appointed
Cemil Bayik, as the guerrillas’ “high authority.” The new title for Bayik
did not mean he was a direct replacement for Ocalan but was recognition
that he now had a greater role in the fight for Kurdish self-rule. <I>Milliyet</I>
said Bayik’s promotion had dealt a blow to the leadership hopes of Ocalan’s
brother Osman.

<P>According to the <I>Turkish Daily News</I> (March 4, 1999) Osman Ocalan,
Cemil Bayik and Kani Yilmaz are vying for power in the PKK. Yilmaz, the
leader of the ERNK, particularly active in Europe, has been eager to succeed
to Ocalan. According to Turkish intelligence sources cited by TDN, the
PKK has enterea period of crisis, due to the non-nomination of a successor
and the full dependence of the organization’s structure on Abdullah Ocalan’s
leadership.

<P>The split and incoherence in the leadership can be seen also in the
contradictory statements and instructions issued lately.

<P>The PKK clearly and emphatically declared by way of Osman Ocalan in
his interview to <I>Der Stern</I> that the PKK would neither wage war again
in European capitals nor kill foreign tourists in Turkey itself. Previous
statements by PKK and its ERNK (political branch) representatives in Europe
also showed great caution regarding violence and terrorist activity.

<P>Nevertheless, on March 15 a communique issued by PKK’s armed branch
ARGK (People’s Liberation Army Of Kurdistan) stated that its “army and
[people] are in a legitimate phase of action. Every region of Turkey is
now a region of war. This means that even the tourist regions of the Turkish
state are included… In order to prevent harm to human lives, tourists from
around the world, but especially from Europe, should not travel to Turkey.”
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Analysis: putting it all together</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>There is no doubt that these latest terrorist attacks are related to the
capture of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the PKK and his forthcoming trial
in Turkey.

<P>But it is still not clear if the latest outburst of violence is indeed
the work of mainstream PKK militants and whether the organization has a
defined leadership with a clear strategy for the near future.

<P>Turkish political analyst Dogu Ergil said he believed that the attack
on the Istanbul department store was carried out by the PKK or by underground
urban leftist groups linked to the rebels. “After losing ground militarily
in the southeast and losing their leader, they are moving to attacks on
urban centers to put pressure on Turkish society and on public opinion,”
Ergil said.

<P>“If you look at the PKK, they don’t directly show their hand in this
kind of action so as to keep their legitimacy in the eyes of Europe,” said
columnist Ismet Berkan to Reuters (March 11, 1999). Instead the PKK, active
in the mountains of the southeast, may have asked their Maoist allies to
carry out the bombings in the cities.

<P>According to Reuters, Turkish leaders have also hinted that TIKKO’s
taking responsibility for the attacks might be intended to divert attention
from those who were actually behind them. “This organization’s claim of
responsibility may not take us down the right road,” said Interior Minister
Cahit Bayar. If this evaluation is correct, the PKK is helping TIKKO to
carry out a proxy urban guerrilla war, thereby insulating the organization
from the political pitfalls of such murderous activity.

<P>But some other possibilities could be conceived.
<UL>
<LI>
The TIKKO and perhaps DHKP/C could take advantage of PKK’s current military
weakness and political irresolution in order to advance their own strategies,
win some important points against the Turkish regime and attract disillusioned
PKK militants to their ranks. In view of the old—and new—political competition
and ideological disagreements between these groups, this scenario should
not be ruled out.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The PKK leadership, as well as the rank-and-file is indeed torn between
the fierce desire of revenge and the need to preserve the present political
gains in the European arena and not to provoke the death of the imprisoned
leader. Therefore it uses a mixture of threats against the Turkish government
and a carefully pragmatic attitude.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The possibility exists that the PKK leadership, or at least its most extremist
faction, could decide on a strategy similar to that used by the Palestinian
Fatah in the early 1970s. They could establish a “phantom” organization,
such as Black September to do the dirty work, without suffering the political
consequences—whether local or international. For many years the Lebanese
Hizballah also used a “telephone organization”—the Islamic Jihad—to take
indirect responsibility for its murderous suicide bombings or hostage kidnappings.</LI>
</UL>
According to the Associated Press, a previously unheard of group called “Revenge Hawks
of Apo”— Apo is Ocalan’s nickname—claimed responsibility for the bombing
of the Istanbul department store. Are we facing of a new PKK strategy?
Only time will tell.

<P>The latest terrorist attacks are still low profile in character, such
as arson and minor bombings. Even the death of 13 people in the arson
attack in Istanbul could be ascribed to “luck” rather than intricate planning.

<P>The true test—for the PKK and for the Turkish government—will be during
Ocalan’s trial. The PKK will have to decide whether to opt for an all-out
campaign of terror, or whether to keep the door open to the political process.
The government will have to decide whether to take the risk of the extreme
confrontation that will ensue if Ocalan is executed, or whether to leave
the way for other options.
