<BR>

<P>Of the three prominent Palestinian organizations that are not the handiwork

of Arab states - Fatah, Naif Hawatma’s Democratic Front for the Liberation

of Palestine (DFLP), and George Habash’s Popular Front for the Liberation

of Palestine (PFLP) - the PFLP is most notable for its ideological dogmatism.

This is evident in its efforts to shape an internally consistent worldview,

and its striving to reduce as far as possible the dualism that has colored

PLO doctrine since 1973 due to the disparity between the precepts of the

Palestinian Covenant and the constraints of reality. Indeed, in the past

decade the PFLP's principal objective has been to demonstrate that its

final goal - the liberation of all of Palestine remains valid and is actually

attainable, in spite of external events. What the PFLP seeks is to remove

all nagging doubts and to restore the lost sense of certainty. This has

caught the PFLP in a web of contradictions and inconsistencies, albeit

to a far lesser degree than, say, the Fatah. Thus, the PFLP's rivals are

not far from the truth when they accuse it of having shifting dogmatism.

On the twentieth anniversary of its founding, we shall examine the foundations

of the PFLP's ideological and operational worldview today. Special emphasis

will be placed on how the radical Palestinian orientation grapples with

obstacles in the path of realizing its goals.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The final Goal: Though It Tarry, It Will Come</FONT></B>

<BR>In PFLP thought, the premise and the conclusion are coterminous: the

liberation of Palestine. For the PFLP this concept is axiomatic and unassailable;

moreover, that the goal appears unrealizable in no sense diminishes the

belief that it will be ultimately achieved. The PFLP's conceptual outlook

is deductive; its program, including its means and tactics, is an outgrowth

of its axiomatic goal. Not only the future of the Palestinians, but the

amelioration of all the ills of the Arab world depend on the process of

the liberation of Palestine. Since, in this view, the Palestinian revolution

constitutes a lever for the Arab revolution, it must be the central focal

point of the Arab interest. The same 'zero-sum game' that is being played

by the Palestinians and Israel, with nothing less than survival at stake,

is also underway between the Arabs and Israel: 'in this region either a

Zionist empire will be created, or a united Arab society’.



<P>Although its final goal has been deferred to the distant future, the

declaration of it has not become a ritual. Meanwhile, the attainment of

the goal is assured by unrelenting efforts - however impeded by circumstances

- to forge the appropriate conditions for its realization. Given this,

'victory is inevitable in the historical long-range, even though every

revolution experiences bitter and vexatious circumstances. In periods of

low ebb for the Palestinians and the Arabs the PFLP considered itself entrusted

with the task of 'keeper of the seal', as it were, of safeguarding the

final goal by attempting to awaken the Arabs to mend their fences and enhance

the balance of forces with Israel. From its very inception the PFLP has

urged forbearance suitable to a long range popular war. This approach stems

primarily from the magnitude of the missions the organization has pegged

to the straggle against Israel, beginning with the desire to transform

that struggle into a catalyst to effect a radical shakeup throughout the

Arab world.



<P>The multiplication of missions is reflected in the multiplication of

enemies: not only external foes such as 'Israel, world Zionism and world

imperialism under US leadership', but also an internal enemy which must

be persecuted unflaggingly: 'Arab reactionism’. The PFLP's worldview rests

on three pillars: Palestinism, Arabism and Marxism-Leninism. A contradiction

exists between Palestinian uniqueness (<I>wataniyya</I>) and an Arab identity

whose ultimate aim is Arab unity (<I>qawmiyya</I>) and, in turn, between

these two elements of national identity and Marxism-Leninism which is based

on class rather than national division. Indeed on the theoretical level

the contradictions between these principles are irreconcilable if the logic

of each is stretched to its limits. However, it is precisely in this realm

where the PFLP sees its paramount doctinal contribution: its success in

developing a formula - theoretical and practical alike encompassing all

three elements.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Nexus: Palestinian Identity and PLO

Independence</FONT></B>

<BR>Asked to enumerate the accomplishments of the PLO. George Habash cited

as its paramount achievement its role in 'crystallizing the national (<I>wataniyya</I>)

struggle-identity of the Palestinian people; reinforcing the cohesiveness

of the Palestinian people; and its struggle with the PLO as the sole legitimate

representative of the Palestinian people. Only someone who had lived through

the period of the hypocritical Arab attitude towards the Palestinian question

prior to the creation of the PLO, he added, could grasp the magnitude of

the achievement. Hence his unshakable conclusion that the PLO constitutes

a great historic accomplishment that must be preserved. For the PFLP, the

concept of the distinctiveness of the Palestinians has the force of a Euclidean

postulate, for to the Palestinian people has been entrusted a unique pioneering

task - in the struggle against the Zionist enemy and against (the Zionist)

entity in Palestine. Though it is self evident to the PFLP that in the

absence of the pan-Arab national dimension, which is reflected in the need

to mobilize all the Arab revolutionary forces Palestine could not be liberated,

yet even here, the PFLP stresses, extreme care must be exercised to ensure

that Arbism does not overshadow Palestinism. Given these fundamental principles,

the PFLP's zealousness for the independence of the PLO becomes readily

comprehensible. Notwithstanding all the vicissitudes which have marked

the PFLP's relations with the PLO leadership, it still regards the PLO

as the legitimate mother organization as long as Arafat's PLO does not

commit the ultimate heresy of actually sitting down to negotiate directly,

on a bilateral basis with Israel, the PFLP will not countenance the creation

of an alternative PLO. A PLO that commits itself to such a settlement will

no longer be worthy of its own name - and under these conditions the PFLP

will support the transformation of the pro-Syrian ‘Salvation Front' into

a new PLO. For the time being however is concerned with the need to rectify

the deviation of the influential leadership. Professing itself amenable

to the restoration of the unification of the organizations in the PLO,

the PFLF nevertheless insists that the renewal of ‘national unity’ under

the aegis of the PLO be conjunctive with the latter's return to a 'liberation

approach' and its rejection of a 'settlement-based approach'. In line with

this, the PFLP set as its condition for joining the Salvation Front the

latter's functioning as no more than a temporary modality aimed at returning

the PLO to the straight and narrow path. Consequently, it strongly rebuffed

the demand of unmistakable offspring of Syria (such as Sa'iqa, Abu-Musa

and Ahmad Jibril) to build up the Salvation Front as a substitute for the

PLO. In this view, the existence of two PLOs would constitute an irrevocable

split which would undo that organization's principal achievement.



<P>When the vision of the 'democratic state' in all of Palestine was first

mooted in the Palestinian arena at the end of the 1960s, the PFLP cited

two reasons for rejecting it: first, it perceived the 'democratic state'

concept as conflicting with the vision of 'Arab unity', since an additional

Palestinian state would only intensify the already existing split. In those

early days the impression had not yet faded of the pronouncedly pan-Arab

content of the old Arab Nationalists Movement (in Arabic: <I>Harakat al-Qawmiyyin

al-Arab</I>) from which the PFLP had emerged. Moreover, the fact that its

breakaway rival, the Democratic Front of Hawatma was among the first proponents

of a 'democratic state', was certainly instrumental in generating PFLP

opposition to the idea. Underlying the second reason for the PFLP's rejection

of the 'democratic state' concept was its belief that the final goal must

be enunciated without any embellishments. The PFLP viewed the reformulation

of the goal as submission to external pressures which, while initially

taking the form of verbal revision only, would eventuate in a change of

actual content. However, it was not long before the PFLP itself, at the

beginning of the 1970s, also embraced the vision of the 'democratic state'

- albeit under the rubric of a 'popular democratic state', in conformity

with its Marxist-Leninist worldview. This shift in orientation reflected

the PFLP's conclusion that a Palestinian state which would restore Palestine

to a state of pristine Arabism was not necessarily a stumbling block on

the long road to the longed for Arab unity. To the contrary, it could well

be a milestone on that trek. Its ready adaptability, moreover, indicated

that the PFLP was at least partially amenable to considerations of tactics

and maneuver.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Negative 'Gradualism' and Positive 'Gradualism'</FONT></B>

<BR>Like all the PLO organizations, albeit with greater reluctance than

the others, following the Yom Kippur War of October, 1973 the PFLP assented

to the idea of 'gradualism'. Under this concept the attainment of a Palestinian

state in the West Bank and Gaza posited as an interim goal towards the

achievement of ‘democratic state' throughout Palestine. At the same time,

the PFLP rejected out of hand any concession whatsoever as a quid pro quo

for securing this interim goal - a move which would block any possible

transition to the final goal. In accepting the idea of ‘gradualism' what

the PFLP had in mind was a unilateral process in which Israel would be

forced to carry out a stage-by-stage withdrawal. A settlement with Israel,

even if it were to entail minimum Palestinian concessions, as was suggested

by the 'phased strategy', was nevertheless perceived as a contradiction

in terms. In principle, the PFLP holds that a sharp distinction must be

drawn between negative 'gradualism', which spells finis to the liberation

of Palestine' and is actually intended to act as camouflage for a settlement

with Israel; and positive open-ended 'gradualism', as necessitated by the

prolonged confrontation in which each phase constitutes a building block

for continuation. As befits an organization defining itself as Marxist-Leninist,

the class explanation serves as a universal code to decipher reality. In

the PFLP's view, the period since the adoption of the 'phased strategy

has demonstrated that negative 'gradualism' accrues to the Arab and Palestinian

bourgeoisie (i.e., the Fatah leadership), while positive 'gradualism' is

invigorated with the revolutionary strength characteristic of the working

classes.



<P>No less an authority than Lenin himself is cited by the PFLP in order

to justify the need to adopt the 'gradualist' approach and to distinguish

between tactics and strategy. Expressly because the confrontation is protracted,

it is urgent to define current goals as temporary measures. However, a

distinction must always be drawn between the primary (strategy) and the

secondary (tactics); the two must not become blurred. Tactics always derive

from strategy, never the reverse. 'The Palestinian Right' (meaning the

Fatah) suffers from the 'tyranny of tactics' syndrome, (<I>Tughyan al-Taktik</I>),

in which, flying in the face of logic and reality, strategy becomes the

handmaiden of tactics.



<P>The 'gradual deterioration' - as the PFLP phrased it - of the PLO leadership

under Arafat commenced with the events of 'Black September' in Jordan,

was accelerated by the October, 1973 way, and was rendered irreversible

by the PLO's expulsion from Beirut towards the end of 1982. The 'Amman

Agreement' (February, 1985) thrust the PLO leadership into the abyss, only

a step away from incontrovertible treachery. Hence the PFLP's position

that the open and unequivocal disavowal of the Amman Agreement by the PLO’s

influential leadership is a sine qua non for commencing negotiations aimed

at relaunching the PLO on the broad revolutionary road. Although the Fatah's

accomplishments in staking out the PLO's revolutionary course in its, early

years cannot be denied, as the difficulties and the obstacles grew the

PLO leadership faltered and its resolve and steadfastness weakened.



<P>Indeed, the twisting road followed by the PLO leadership is seen as

confirmation of the PFLP's class analysis, which typifies the 'national

bourgeoisie’ as spineless and vacillating. Even when the PLO resolved to

embark on the road to a settlement, its fear of the wrath of the masses

led it to adopt a public ‘yes-and-no’ approach in order to leave itself

room for retreat. However, the PFLP has from its very inception designated

itself to replace the Right on the leadership and to push the latter to

'base' - from leader to the status of the rank and file. Thus, while the

'national bourgeoisie’ is not to be ostracized from the course of the revolution,

it must be deprived of its position of seniority as it has exhausted its

leadership potential.



<P>The PFLP posits two principal stages in the decline of the PLO leadership.

From 1974-1982 (the period between the Yom Kippur War and the Lebanon war)

the Right conceded the PLO's national goals while adhering to the solution

advocated by the Soviet Union - and requiring its participation in their

attainment. The PLO's concessions, then, remained within the parameters

of the Soviet approach. Beginning in 1982, however, the PFLP holds, the

PLO leadership embarked on a course ultimately leading to an exclusively

American sponsored settlement. The PLO's vacillations are reflected in

the contraction of its objectives: from the sacrosanct goal of a 'democratic

state' in all of Palestine, the 'Right' then reduced its demand to a Palestinian

state in part of Palestine - provided it was independent - and, in the

wake of 1982, took yet another step in this direction by seeking a Palestinian

state dependent on the good graces of Jordan. Thus, having abandoned irrevocably

the path of 'liberation', the 'Right' can at best bring about a state in

part of Palestine - a development which would mark the utter demise of

the PLO's strategic goals. For the PFLP this would be a highly doubtful

marginal gain, certainly not worth the price of the irreparable damage

it would entail.



<P>The PFLP view the crisis wrecking the PLO as primarily internal. The

traditional leadership is clinging to the vestiges of power, even though

the desperate situation calls for a change of guard. As George Habash put

it, 'The crisis of the Palestinian revolution originates in the democratic

forces (i.e., the Left headed by the PFLP) not being represented on the

leadership in a manner commensurate with the acute failure of the bourgeoisie

(i.e., Fatah). In this view, the PLO's rehabilitation depends above all

on internal realignment tantamount to 'a revolution within a revolution’.

The PFLP's stand with respect to the unity of the organizations is designed

to translate this slogan into practice: since it considers the Amman Agreement

the height of the 'Rights deviation from the path of revolution, the PLO

leadership must publicly wash its hands of it as a precondition for any

dialogue. This demand was the PFLP's condition for rejoining the PLO at

the 18th Palestinian National Council (PNC) meeting in Algiers April, 1987.



<P>It is noteworthy that throughout 1983 the PFLP had demanded the unconditional

ouster of Arafat prior to any discussion about restoring PLO unity. However,

the combination of Soviet persuasiveness and the PFLP's desire to demonstrate

its independence of Syria following the siege of Tripoli, apparently induce

the PFLP to relax its ultimative stance. In this connection it found itself

concurring with the assessment of Hawatma's Democratic Front that obstructing

Arafat organizationally (by demanding collective leadership) and politically

(by demanding that he disavow his current policy, as distinct from his

immediate ouster would generate a process which would enin his fall from

power. The PFLP's revised approach was reflected in the Aden-Algeria accord

(July, 1984), to the intense displeasure of the overtly pro Syrian organizations,

which continued to insist on Arafat's removal. Since the spring of 1984,

the PFLP has ceased to center it: moves on the personal demand to have

Arafat ousted. Also conscious of Arafat's lofty position in the eyes of

most Palestinians at the symbol of their aspiration for independence, the

PFLP has no wish to make itself a target for their abuse by identifying

totally with the stand of the Syrians and their Palestinian satellites.

Instead, it works for Arafat's gradual removal from all positions of influence

by means of its political and organizational demands.



<P>In the realm of doctrine and principle the PFLP is unrivaled in consistency

and resolve. As long as it formulates its criticisms of the Fatah in ideological

terms, the dividing lines between the two trends of 'gradualism' are perfectly

clear. However, since not even the dogged consistency of the PFLP is a

match for the convoluted situation in the real world, the organization

sometimes finds itself unable to practice what it preaches. No better illustration

of this is to be found than the PFLP's attitude towards the Fez Plan. Shortly

after the plan's adoption at the Arab summit conference in Fez, (September,

1982) the PFLP denounced it in the following terms: The 'Fez Plan’, or

the so-called Arab Peace Plan, basically constitutes a unilateral initiative

of Arab reactionism without any <I>quid pro quo</I>, as it declares readiness

to recognize the Zionist entity, accords the Reagan Plan great leverage,

derails the Arab military option, and places all its cards in the hands

of the American administration.



<P>This was an approach consistent with the PFLP's basic principle, which

would never countenance even a hint of a possible settlement with Israel.

Yet within a matter of days, at the sixteenth PNC session (February, 1983),

the PFLP was to affiliate itself with the concluding statement which declared

the Fez resolutions to be 'the minimum for the political activity of the

Arab states'. True, PFLP spokesmen stated off the record in the behind

the scenes discussions of the Political Committee that they had objected

to the seventh clause of the Fez Plan, which implies recognition of Israel.

Still, whatever the excuses adduced by the FPLP (such as the need to maintain

PLO unity, and Syrian pressure) with the aim of resolving the contradiction,

its action assenting to the resolutions of the 16th PNC) is irrevocable.

Furthermore, the PFLP is demanding that the PLO annul the resolutions of

the 17th PNC, held in Amman, in favor of those passed by the 16th PNC (which,

as noted, incorporate the Fez resolutions) the legitimate common denominator

capable of uniting all the organizations. Another striking instance demonstrating

that even the PFLP is sometimes forced to abandon its own principles the

face of the actual state of affairs (in this case, its relations with Moscow),

is to be found in its readiness to express a positive, albeit qualified,

attitude towards the Soviet plan to resolve the Middle East conflict (in

the resolutions of the 15th and 16th sessions).



<P>As noted, the PFLP offers its own explanations and excuses in order

to resolve such contradictions and demonstrate its unwavering allegiance

to its principles. In the first place, it maintains, this initiative is

not of its own making but is that of third parties. Second, the US and

Israel in any case firmly reject both the Fez Resolutions and the Soviet

plan, and will continue doing so in the future. Third, even if a miracle

occurs and a political process is launched according to these guidelines,

they are sufficiently undemanding in terms of concessions to Israel, so

as to leave open the possibility of leaping from them to the 'democratic

state' through Palestine at a future date. A concrete example of this line

of argument may be found in the remarks of Habash's deputy, Abu Mustafa,

who declared in an interview: 'We believe that the Soviet stand, which

calls for an international conference to solve the Middle East crisis,

whose center is the Palestinian question, is correct line with which to

confront the American exclusivity in the region'. Asked whether the PFLP

would cease its struggle against Israel when the later returned the West

Bank and Gaza. He replied with a firm negative, explaining that those areas

were too small to hold all the Palestinians; hence the only complete solution

of the Palestinian problem involved all of Palestine. For as Mustafa explained,

the guarantee that the struggle against Israel will persist is the Palestinian

people's demand for return, since the majority of the Palestinians who

are candidates for return originate from within the Israel of the Green

Line.



<P>There is clearly a substantial disparity between the principles of the

PFLP's positive Gradualism', which rules out any settlement and the organization's

readiness to support, however reluctantly, programs which embody a 'tiny'

settlement with Israel. The shift in orientation becomes more palpable

if we recall that in the wake of Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1978, it

was the PFLP that spurned the entire gamut of PLO Organizations to adopt

the 'Tripoli Document’ (December, 1977) which rejected any possible settlement

or negotiations with Israel. The PFLPS demand that the 'Tripoli Document’

be vested with the force of an authoritative PNC resolution was torpedoed

by the Fatah. Today, however, the PFLP is calling for the renewal of PLO

unity on the basis of the resolutions of the 16th PNC meeting(1983)which

incorporated a positive reference of the Fez resolutions and to the Brezhnev

Plan. Whereas in the past any form of Settlement was considered anathema

because it flew in the face of the final goal, today a certain kind of

settlement is regarded as permissible based on the supposition that a phased

and temporary settlement of the kind being mooted will move the Palestinians

another notch on the way to the ‘liberation’.



<P>Patently, then, even the dogmatic PFLP is not immune from changes necessitated

by the constraints of reality. Its fluctuating Stands make the PFLP a target

for frequent attacks by the Abu Nidal organization, which professes to

doubt whether George Habash still advocates the liberation of all of Palestine.

The PFLP itself is wracked by constant agonizing and self questioning,

and from time to time seems to suffer ideological qualms of conscience.

It maintains that, at the time it assented against its own better judgment

to the Phased plan which embodies incipient acquiescence to a Political

process, and to the 'Arab Peace Plan' drawn up in Fez, the premise underlying

its acceptance was this - provided it constituted the absolute outer limit

of Palestinian concessions - was the necessary price to be paid for maintaining

the integrity of the PLO. Yet as time passed the PFLP found, according

to its own testimony, that the pragmatic Palestinian and Arab camp was

exploiting these concessions as a jumping-off point for still more concessions.

With reference to the phased plan, the PFLP found that the Palestinian

Right is seeking to make it the preface to a settlement, if it has deluded

itself to thinking that it will have a part such a settlement. As for the

Fez plan, it became apparent to the PFLP that the pragmatic camp was positing

the Amman Agreement as consistent with the Fez resolutions - the latter

as a means to the former - hence its own assent to those resolutions was

being cited as grounds which could justify any form of settlement. The

upshot is that PFLP leaders frequently express regret for, and even disavowal

of, their past assent in this regard. Thus, from time to time, the PFLP

declares that since the Fez resolutions had been so distorted and so void

of their actual content, it considers itself free to demand the formulation

of a fresh position, disclaiming those resolutions and free of any obfuscation.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Arab Nexus: Arabism in Thought and in Deed</FONT></B>

<BR>The disintegration of the <I>Qawmiyyun al-Arab</I> and the outgrowth

from it of the PFLP was embof a reversal in the order of priorities. Whereas

the <I>Qawmiyyun al-Arab</I> had held that Arab unity was the road and

the precondition for the return to Palestine (according to the slogan:

<I>al-Wahda Tariqal-Awda</I>), the PFLP, having assimilated the lessons

of the failure of Arab unity, called for the confrontation with Israel

to be advanced (with the assistance of 'bases of concentration' and 'national

regimes' in the Arab confrontation states, which the PFLP dubs 'countries

of the ring' because they ring Israel). For all that, in its authoritative

resolutions, the PFLP continued to emphasize its unwavering adherence to

'realizing Arab unity and establishing the single popular democratic Arab

state'.



<P>Still discernible in the PFLP's references to Arabism is the ideological

residue of the <I>Qawmiyyun</I> al-Arab. This holds that the existence

of a single Arab nation is an incontrovertible historical fact grounded

in unity of language and history, and in ‘uniformity of mental and cultural

qualities’. The current fragmentation into separate countries is temporary,

a kind of deviation, and is not in the nature of evidence which could refute

the existence of a single Arab nation. Unity itself will be engendered

by the conjunction of the socialist-oriented revolutions from the various

parts of the Arab world. Hence, no contradiction exists between the establishment

of a 'popular-democratic state' in Palestine, and complete Arab unity,

since the latter will actually be the product of the liberation and subsequent

merger of the various regions. Once Palestine is integrated into the overall

Arab union, there will be no reason to fear that the Jewish majority will

leave its imprint in the democratic Palestinian state, should it choose

to remain there. Arab unity will be marked by progressiveness, with the

superseding of the bourgeoisie as the class bearing the vision of liberation

and unity by the working class as the sole bearer of change in the Arab

world.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Reliance on the 'National Regimes and on 'Bases of

Concentration'</FONT></B>

<BR>Since the PFLP considers itself to be the repository of Arabism, and

since it is aware that on its own the Palestinians’ armed struggle is incapable

of effecting the liberation of Palestine, it is only natural that the organization

make certain demands from the Arab world. Thus, it is essential that 'the

course of the liberation of Palestine rely on Arab strategic depth. Taking

a sober eyed view of the situation in the Arab world, the PFLP identifies

two potential points of support:



<P>(1) The 'national regimes', of which Syria, expounding the most militant

line among the states bordering on Israel, is the leading representative.

Siding with it are more remote countries: South Yemen (which prior to the

internal chaos which wracked it in January, 1986 was viewed by the PFLP

as the prototype of an Arab Marxist regime), Algeria and Libya. Whereas

an existential struggle is underway with the 'reactionary regimes' in Egypt,

Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which are ranked together

with Israel as enemies, relations with the 'national regimes' are to be

based on 'alignment and struggle' (<I>Taha-luf-w-Sira’</I>) as the PFLP

terms it. In other words, the areas of agreement and disagreement must

be defined: what is essential will be treated as such, and what is secondary

will be relegated to its proper place. The areas of dispute must not be

allowed to override the areas of agreement.



<P>(2) The establishment of 'concentration of support bases' (<I>qu’idat

‘rtikaz</I>) in the 'ring' countries around Israel, there by creating extraterritorial

zones under the control of the Palestinian revolution, akin to an 'Arab

Hanoi'. The freedom of action which these bases are designed to provide

is immeasurably greater than what the 'national regimes' can permit. In

consequence, an alliance of action is required with the latter, entailing

compromise and preference of the principal contradiction' (the confrontation

with Israel and the USA over 'secondary contradictions' resulting from

the PFLP's relations with these regimes. By contrast, the fate of the extraterritorial

zones in the ‘reactionary regimes' will be decided by force of arms. The

bitter fact is that a ‘national regime' in Syria, jealous of its sovereignty,

bars others from using its territory for launching operations against Israel;

but the PFLP, swallowing its chagrin at this state of affairs, refrains

from a head-on clash with Damascus on this issue. As against this, the

establishment of 'bases of concentration' entails a bitter and protracted

struggle with the 'reactionary regimes', albeit one which dovetails with

the effort to win over the local inhabitants and incite them to revolt

against their rulers. The PFLP does not view this as gross intervention

in the internal affairs of Arab states, since according to its pan-Arab

conception, the entire Arab world is a platform for its activity.



<P>In the PFLP's perception, this approach, which is based on the creation

of conditions in the Arab world, enabling progress to be made towards the

liberation of Palestine, is actually a fusion between the Palestinian revolution

and the Arab revolution. And both revolutions benefit: the actuality of

the liberation of Palestine and of Arab unity is maintained by virtue of

the fact that a process towards their realization has been set in motion,

even if that process is partial and gradual. At the same time, this concept

simultaneously confronts the PFLP's three sworn enemies: Israel, Arab reactionism,

and Western imperialism led by the US, which backs them all.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Syria as the Prototype of a 'National Regime’</FONT></B>

<BR>The problematics of the PFLP's attitude towards Syria as a 'national

regime' provide a concrete illustration of the relations entailed by the

'alignment and struggle' approach. Against the backdrop of the insoluble

problems in the Arab world, the PFLP considers Syria to be 'a formidable

bastion in the face of the Zionist enemy' and as 'playing a paramount role

in confronting the American plans. The underlying reasons cited by the

PLFP for the importance of Syria rest on two assumptions and one conclusion:

the Lebanon war demonstrated, on the one hand, that Israel is not invincible,

but on the other hand it once more emerged incontrovertibly that the Palestinians

alone are no match for it. The inevitable conclusion, then, is that it

is incumbent upon the Palestinians to rally around the Syrian banner as

a militant focal point and as the keeper of the flame of the Arab struggle

against Israel. Syria's notion of ‘strategic parity' strikes a responsive

chard within the PFLP. In the organization's view, Syria demonstrated in

practice, by its undermining of the May 17, 1983 agreement between Lebanon

and Israel, that it is capable of forcing Israel to retreat without even

the semblance of a concession.



<P>The PFLP pinned considerable hopes on Syria in the wake of the Lebanon

war. Indeed, by opting to base itself permanently in Damascus, it seemed

to be sending a clear signal that it wished to throw in its lot with Syria.

For the Palestinian revolution to recover from its exile from Lebanon,

the PFLP maintained, Syria must serve as its prop. It was these considerations

that motivated it to join the Salvation Front. Its assumption was that

Syria would enable the Palestinians to preserve the Palestinian gun in

Lebanon and to utilize that arena which, it said, had become the 'focal:

point of the Arab-Zionist struggle', in order to fight Israel. The aftermath

of the Lebanon war enhanced that country's standing in the eyes of the

PFLP, who began to talk of it as a 'second pillar' of the Palestinian revolution

(the 'first pillar' was the West Bank and Gaza). On the other hand, the

Jordanian arena, which prior to the Lebanon war ranked high in the PFLP's

perception, now assumed a minor status, although it did expect Syria to

allow it to infiltrate Jordan from Syrian territory.



<P>In the PFLP's view, the positive lessons of the Lebanon war, outweighed

the negative ones. It saw the war as the first 'popular war' in modern

Arab history and one, moreover, in which Israel had sustained considerable

losses and hadbeen unable to attain a good many of its objectives. Moreover,

unlike the aftermath of past wars, Israel for the first time withdrew unconditionally

and without any political quid pro quo, principally because of the internal

dispute that was consuming Israel from within. Furthermore, the war had

underlined the US posture as a threat to the Arabs and underscored the

USSR as their friend. Nevertheless, the PFLP also found negative lessons

in the war: the weakness of the Arab world had been exposed, and the dead

end in which the 'bourgeois leaders’ were caught was plain for all to see;

the tendency towards political deviationism within the PLO had intensified;

the revolutionary alternative to the Arab and Palestinian 'bourgeois' leadership

had not yet crystallized. Yet even the shadows contained a bright side,

as they heralded the end of the era of the 'bourgeois' leadership and signaled

the necessity for an extensive realignment of forces.



<P>Precisely because the PFLP had pinned its hopes on the Syria of Hafez

al-Asad after the Lebanon war, its disappointment and frustration were

all the more intense when Damascus did not prevent the Shi'ite organization

Amal from striking repeatedly at he refugee camps outside Beirut. George

Habash even went so far as to state publicly that Syria had given Amal

a green light to execute a plan aimed at 'liquidating the armed Palestinian

national role in Lebanon.’ That Habash had removed himself all the way

to Algeria in order to condemn Damascus, and that PFLP spokesmen were at

pains to deny his denunciation, only deepened the morass into which PFLP-Syrian

relations had fallen. Not even the PFLP's support for a Pax Syriaca in

Lebanon on the lines of the 'Damascus Agreement' (June 17, 1985) - according

the Salvation Front the status of representative of the Palestinian side

proved to be of any avail. Its support for the Syrian settlement in Lebanon

notwithstanding, Amal kept up its barrage of the refugee camps, and Syria

did not lift a finger.



<P>A similar dilemma confronted the PFLP, and the Salvation Front as a

whole, in the form of the Syria-Jordan rapprochement. Following the Amman

Agreement, the PFLP had lambasted the Jordanian-PLO partnership, but Syria's

new moves were showing up the organization as both impotent and as guided

by a double standard. Its vehemence against Arafat gave way to restraint

when it came to Syria. As long as Syria treated Arafat like a pariah, the

PFLP and Syria, for all their differences, could proceed together along

the same road. However, once it became evident that Syria was out to undercut

the independent Palestinian presence in Lebanon, indeed, to assail the

very existence of an independent PLO, the PFLP's restraint could be only

interpreted as granting Palestinian approval of Syria's actions. The question

was how long the PFLP could exercise restraint, and when it would reach

the conclusion that its relations with Syria were no longer tenable. What

made the PFLP's distress even more acute was that Syria had been posited

as one of the linchpins of the organization's strategic thinking after

the Lebanon war; yet, disappointingly, Syria was following its own course

of action, oblivious of the role assigned it by the PFLP.



<P>It would seem that the attitude the organization should adopt towards

Syria, with all that this implies for issues such as the Salvation Front,

the 'war of the camps', relations with the Fatah and the restoration of

PLO unity, is a main source of the internal dispute festering at the PFLP's

senior level. Outwardly, the PFLP speaks with one voice - generally that

of George Habash - as befits the principles of 'democratic centralism'

and 'iron discipline' which are foundations of the PFLP's internal constitution.

Nevertheless, signs of the dispute simmering within the organization sometimes

boil over into public view. At one pole is the approach typified by Ahmad

al-Yamani (code named Abu-Mahir, be served in the past as the PFLP's permanent

representative on the PLO executive committee). Al-Yamani has close ties

with Syria and it was not by chance that he was appointed secretary of

the Salvation Front. Adherents of this approach are enthusiastic opponents

of the need to deepen relations with Syria, and preach a formula of coexistence

between Syria and the Palestinian revolution even at the expense of the

latter. At the opposite pole is the approach identified with Bassam Abu-Sharif

(former PFLP spokesman and editor of al Hadaf which advocates keeping distance

from Syria, fearing the rage of Damascus. Thus, Bassam Abu-Sharif opposed

the PFLP's entry into the Salvation Front and it was not surprising that

he chose to leave Damascus after Front was established in mid-1985. Finally,

Abu-Sharif pursued its attitude to its logical end by joining Arafat as

a close political adviser.



<P>The orientation represented by Abu-Sharif calls for the most effort

to be invested in restoring PLO unity; unlike the rival approach, it does

nor insist on Arafat's ouster as a sine quo non for negotiations with the

Fatah. The fact is that Bassam Abu-Sharif has always maintained an open

channel with the Fatah and Arafat alike, even during periods of a total

impasse in relations between the PFLP and Fatah. That the Syrians suspected

him of collaborating with the Fatah was only natural. By taking a midi

line between these two extremes, George Habash has managed preserve unity

within his organization. Although the actual balance of forces within the

PFLP is a closed book, there is no doubt that as long as Habash is alive

and active - however poor his health - he will go on calling the shots.



<P><I>Jordan as the Prototype of a Reactionary Regime</I>



<P>The crushing defeat sustained by the PLO in September, 1970 in Jordan

undermined the PFLP's confidence in its basic assumption that 'the road

to Palestine will pass through Amman. Jordan's natural attributes as a

jumping-off point into Palestine - its geographical proximity to the West

Bank and the massive demographic Palestinian presence on the East Bank

- proved to be insufficient. Although the PFLP continued to call vigorously

for the extirpation of the Hashemite regime and the creation of a 'democratic

national government in Jordan which would operate shoulder to shoulder

with the PLO against Israel, eventually it was forced to acknowledge its

inability to realize so far-reaching goal. Beginning in the latter part

of the 1970s, it focused its effort on curtailing the evolving dialogue

between Hussein and Arafat. Again and again the PFLP warned against Hussein’s

intention of gradually depriving the PLO of its standing as the representative

of the Palestinians. Like the mainstream in the PLO, the PFLP also recognized

that, realistically speaking, a close affinity must inevitably prevail

between the two Banks. Yet precisely for this reason it considered the

assurance of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza

a precondition for a confederation with Jordan, Manifestly, this was to

be a non-Hashemite Jordan, for it was the PFLP's belief that only with

such a state would coexistence be a viable proposition.



<P>But the PFLP's worst fears were soon to become reality in the form of

the Amman Agreement (February 1985) which marked out parameters for cooperation

between Hussein and Arafat. As for Arafat's readiness to agree to the formation

of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation for negotiations and to a confederation

with Jordan - but without making these contingent on the independence of

a Palestinian state - the PFLP viewed these as the shameful concession

to Jordan of half of the Palestinians birthright. The PFLP was unshakable

in its conviction that the Amman Agreement constituted a milestone en route

to the annulment of the Rabat resolutions which had granted the PLO exclusivity

in representing the Palestinians; to them, it was as clear as day that

with this accord the PLO was being sucked into an arrangement of which

the US was the chief promoter and which would mean the extinction of the

PLO's independent standing and autonomous goal. The PFLP found untenable

the Fatah contention that its coordination efforts with Jordanwere actually

aimed at preventing Jordan from making a separate settlement. To the contrary,

the PFLP maintained that the linkup with Jordan would go a long way towards

preparing the ground for a unilateral Jordanian move for the infamous Jordanian

option. This, for the PFLP the Amman Agreement was the heart of the policy

urged by the advocates of 'settlement' among the Palestinians; hence also

its absolute insistence that the Fatah disavow the agreement openly and

unreservedly as a condition for the PFLP's entering into a dialogue aimed

at internal reconciliation.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Iran-Iraq War</FONT></B>

<BR>Like the 'war of the camps', the Iran-Iraq war and the resultant disarray

in the Arab world created a situation to which the PFLP's ideology did

not have a ready-made response. When the war broke out the PFLP denounced

the Iraqi aggression against the 'Iranian revolution of the masses' and

lauded the 'progressive Islam' which characterized that revolution. The

PFLP explained that the Iraqi aggression against Iran was yet another among

the plethora of signs that Iraq was being swept into the camp of 'Arab

reactionism' whereas Iran had staked out a place 'in the camp hostile to

imperialism and supportive of the struggle of the Palestinian people’.

Like Syria, then, which also styled itself as the keeper of the flame of

Arabism, the PFLP took a position against an Arab side. Moreover, this

non-Arab side being backed by the PFLP was burning with the fire of Islamic

fundamentalism which was anathema to the Marxist-Leninist PFLP; in the

West Bank and Gaza, for example, the PFLP treats the fundamentalists, as

its mortal enemies.



<P>After Iran successfully repulsed the Iraqis and even managed to penetrate

Iraqi territory at several points, the PFLP reformulated its position on

the war. It now called on both belligerents to cease the conflict, citing

three reasons: It was depleting the resources both countries and weakening

them irrevocably; it was creating an opening for the 'meddling of colonialism',

meaning the US, in the region; and it was diverting attention and efforts

away from the conflict with Israel. Thus from its original stance of total

identification with Iran, the PFLP moved to a more neutral approach urging

both sides to return to the pre-war borders. Although the PFLP continued

to denounce the 'dictatorial fascist regime' in Baghdad, which it located

within 'the reactionary Jordanian Egyptian-Iraqi triangle’. it now emphasized

that the ouster of Saddam Hussein and his replacement by a 'democratic

national regime' which would 'restore to Iraq its role in the Arab-Zionist

conflict and against the designs Of imperialism', was the sole affair of

the Iraqi nation. Implicit in this modified stance was the PFLP's opposition

to the Iranian aim of persisting in the campaign until the collapse of

the Saddam Hussein regime. Besides its wish to bring a halt to the bloodshed

and stem the depletion of resources, the PFLP expressed its apprehension

that the Islamic revolution would spread to Iraq and lead to the establishment

there of an Iran-backed regime.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Marxism-Leninism and the International Orientation</FONT></B>

<BR>The PFLP defines itself as a Marxist-Leninist organization. It considers

Marxism-Leninism to be a 'scientific method' enabling an accurate analysis

Of the problems of the Arab world. The system of class analysis, then,

is meant to serve national goals. The PFLP fakes pride in its role as catalyst

of Marxism-Leninism in the Arab world. The organization is at pains to

ensure that its personnel are inculcated with this doctrine; according

to George Habash, for example, two thirds of the members of the PFLP leadership

have received a Marxist-Leninist education in the Soviet bloc.



<P>Until the end of the 1970s the PFLP was most particular about terming

itself a Marxist-Leninist organization and assiduously refrained from describing

itself as Communist. The Communist Parties in the Arab world were in severe

disrepute and were seen as Moscow's lackeys. The Communists emulation of

Moscow's Stand on the partition resolution and on the recognition of Israel’s

existence was considered ignominious, in particular by the PFLP. However,

ever since the Fourth Conference of the PFLP (April, 1981)this differentiation

has been blurred and the organization has defined itself alternatively

as Marxist-Leninist or Communist. Indeed, in recent years the PFLP has

described itself as being in a process of transformation (<I>tahawwul</I>)

into a Communist party which is to constitute the core for the unification

of the Palestinian Left. The PFLP's expectation is that this core will

grow into a 'United Leftist Arab Party'. Seemingly, this tendency is consistent

with the growing trend within the PFLP since the 1970s, to regard the Soviet

Union as its ideological and political patron.



<P>The PFLP has undergone a mini-revolution in its attitude towards the

Soviet Union. At the end of the 1960s the organization posited that from

among the socialist countries 'the primary alliance should be with China,

Vietnam and Cuba, whereas only the potential for an alliance exists where

the Eastern European states are concerned'. Explaining the distinction

it drew between the two camps, the PFLP stated that it hesitated to identify

blindly with the Soviet Union because of the latter's stand on the Palestinian

question. In those years it was also critical of Moscow's policy of detente

vis-a-vis the West and it sided with China in the Sino-Soviet dispute.

However, since the latter half of the 1970s the PFLP has cited signs of

'China's collusion with imperialism'. Clear evidence of this trend with

respect to the Arab world was said to be evinced by China's support for

the Camp David accords and its backing of Sadat personally. In a total

reversal of stands, the PFLP began to spit into the well it had drunk from

in its initial years, suppressing its notion of the USSR's original sin

of supporting Israel, and leveling withering criticism at the 'deviationist'

Chinese leadership in its publications.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>'The Occupied Territories - The First Pillar'</FONT></B>

<BR>In its formative writings at the end of the 1960s the PFLP attached

equal importance to the struggle within the 'occupied Land' and to the

struggle for the creation of 'bases of concentration' in the Arab states

bordering on Palestine. However, as George Habash explained, as the PLO

ran into increasing difficulties in sustaining itself in an extraterritorial

domicile outside Palestine, and in particular after its foothold in Lebanon

was undercut, the 'occupied land gained dominance as 'the first and fundamental

pillar of the Palestinian revolution'. The growing significance of the

territory of Palestine on the PLO's scale of ,priorities had the effect

of transferring into it the rivalries among he Palestinian organizations,

and this organizational competition in turn magnified still further the

struggle 'inside' as a paramount focal point of PLO activity. Yet even

under these conditions the PFLP refuses to consider the possibility of

restricting operations to Palestine alone, maintaining that the activity

‘inside' must be supplemented by building external bases as 'Second Pillar'.

When the need arises, the PFLP holds, these external bases can pin down

part Of the enemy forces and hamper their effective operation against the

forces of the Palestinian revolution within the territories.



<P>Moreover, in the PFLP's view the maintenance of the 'Palestinian gun'

outside Palestine is a vital morale booster for the Palestinians 'inside’

As Habash put it. 'We feel that our activity on the occupied land must

be the fundamental pillar. But let us not be content with this. We must

not abandon our masses inside as prey to despair. Experience has shown

that the maintenance of a fighting Palestinian gun outside has always constituted

an exemplary moral and material standard for the masses of our people inside.

Habash added that this was his principal lesson from the PFLP’s experience

in Gaza at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s: as long as

Israel had to divide its effort between two fronts - the Jordanian until

September 1970 and the Egyptian during the war of attrition the PFLP could

put up a tenacious struggle. But the collapse of the external ‘second pillar’

would topple the ‘first pillar’ as well. Furthermore, the PFLP insisted

on making a distinction between the effort preserve what already exists

- namely, the Palestinian-Arab character of the West Bank and the Gaza

strip - and the onset of the process of their actual liberation. The need

to rely on bases of concentration outside these areas remained as in the

past a <I>sine quo non</I> for liberation.



<P>The PFLP agrees with the Fatah as well as with the gloomy view of King

Hussein (in his farewell speech to the PLO leadership in February, 1986)

that the ground is slipping from beneath the feet of the Palestinians in

the territories due to the Israeli measures of ‘expropriation, settlement

and creeping annexation'. It admits that above all else, the average Palestinian

longs to be rid of Israeli rule. As George Habash puts it: ‘I know the

apolitical (Palestinian) resident who comes from the West Bank or Gaza.

What do these people say? What is the principal problem as they see it?

Their main problem is the occupation and the settlements issue. Habash

goes on to acknowledge that this oppressive situation provides fertile

ground for the viewpoint propounded by Hussein and Arafat, that the little

that can be achieved is better than nothing.



<P>George Habash rejects this approach out of hand - but for realistic-practical

reasons, and not necessarily on ideological grounds. He does not believe

that what Hussein and Arafat maintain is theoretically possible - namely,

that a political process that will push Israel back is within the realm

of practicability. The choice, then, does not lie between attaining something

or being left with nothing, but between, on the one side, the certainty

that nothing will be attained or that the concessions involved will be

irreversible (that is, at the expense of the PLO and its goals) and, on

the other side, the high probability that the 'national alternative’ being

proposed by the PFLP will prove fruitful in the long run. Habash declares

his awareness that he has no immediate answer for the Palestinian's distress

other than 'blood, sweat and tears’, but he believes that this is the only

road available to them. For the time being the Palestinians can consider

their 'steadfastness' and achievement, one that is destined to prevent

solutions based on American exclusivity.



<P>The PFLP recognizes that the determination, endurance and forbearance

it is demanding of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza will be mere

words if they are not backed up by appropriate organizational frameworks.

Indeed, the PFLP, like Hawatma's Democratic Front, is ready to allow the

internal leadership in the territories broad freedom of action on operational

matters, provided that the leadership acknowledge in principle the authority

of the PLO leadership 'outside'. Neither the PFLP nor the DFLP tire of

demanding implementation of the resolution (adopted at the 16th PNC in

February, 1983 concerning the need to activate the 'Palestinian National

Front' and vest it with the lofty standing of the 'basic and active arm

of the PLO on the occupied land'. Fatah, by contrast, fearing loss of its

control over the leadership ‘inside', is making every effort to render

this resolution a dead letter. As a consequence, the Fatah finds it necessary

to resort to the East Bank as a vital vantage point over developments inside

the territories, even if this entails cooperating with King Hussein. The

PFLP, then, advocates boosting the territories capacity for self-reliance,

which implies delegating as many operational powers as possible, in the

areas of both covert military activity and oven popular political activity.

This self-reliance is perceived as enabling the PA 'inside' to remain immune

from the hardship it is experiencing 'outside'. Moreover, it obviates the

reliance on the good graces of the 'reactionary' Jordanian regime, which

is anathema to the PFLP.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Permissible and Forbidden in Overseas Terrorism</FONT></B>

<BR>Unlike the Fatah, which in its 'Cairo Declaration' November 1985 renewed

its freeze, dating back to 1974, on all forms of overseas terrorism, the

PFLP does not automatically rule out such activity, though it does qualify

its objectives. In principle, the entire world is an arena of confrontation

for the PFLP, since its principal enemies include western imperialism and

world Zionism. The initial reservations concerning overseas terrorism were

expressed at the PFLP's Third Conference (March,1972) which ruled that

'enemy targets must be chosen... in a manner which will not elicit conflicting

interpretations regarding the legitimacy and suitability of the choices.

Although this was not explicitly stated, the restriction was in fact directed

at the type of activity in which the PFLP had specialized until that time:

hijacking of airplanes. Inevitably in such operations, foreign parties

who are not a direct factor in the Arab - Israeli conflict will also be

hurt. The fact is that following the adoption of this resolution, PFLP-initiated

hijackings ceased.



<P>However, this restriction fanned an internal dispute within the PFLP

between advocates of Overseas terrorism of all forms (including continued

hijackings), headed by Wadi, Haddad and Fa'iz Jabir, on the one hand, and

George Habash and his followers, on the other hand, who continued to perpetrate

acts of terrorism overseas, but with the exception of airplane hijackings.

This dispute flared into a full-fledged rift which ended with the breakaway

of Haddad and Jabir from the PFLP from the PFLP in the mid-1970s. The two

set up their own organization, which initiated, among other acts, the hijacking

of an AirFrance plane to Entebbe in July 1976.



<P>The resolutions of the PFLP’s fourth - and to date, last - congress

(February, 1981) reiterate its approach with greater clarity. After instructing

its fighters to devastate the ‘Zionist enemy’ inside the ‘occupied homeland’

inter alias by means of infiltration from the Arab states, it directs them

‘to continue delivering specific blows to the enemy outside (i.e., overseas),

particularly against its commanders and its military and security cadres.

On the face of it, the formulation admits of two possible interpretations:

according to the narrow interpretation, this resolution, like its predecessor

at the Third Conference, refers exclusively to airplane hijacking; but

according to the broad interpretation, it refers to all overseas terrorism

in which it is absolutely certain that outsiders will unavoidably be hurt.

Hence, if an attack can be confined to Israeli targets abroad, in principle

the authority for its execution exists.



<P>The public reactions of authorized PFLP spokesmen to spectacular acts

of overseas terrorism such as the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise

ship, the massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports, the series of attacks

in Paris), together with additional solid information regarding the PFLP's

policy on overseas terrorism, tilt the scales to the side of the broad

interpretation. The bottom line, then, is that unlike the DFLP, which rejects

overseas terrorism in principle, and in contrast to the Fatah, which has

declared a freeze on such terrorism, the PFLP permits this kind of operation

in principle. The condition for carrying it out is, according to George

Habash, that these operations be 'judicious and carefully selected - meaning

that they are to focus on Israeli targets abroad’. As for Jewish targets

abroad, since in the statement cited above Habash subsumes the slaughter

in the Istanbul synagogue and the operations in Karachi and Paris under

the category of attacks against 'innocent persons' which deserve condemnation,

it would seem that Habash would bar attacks on Diaspora Jews.



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel's Image: Is the Class Division Applicable</FONT></B>

<BR>As a Marxist-Leninist organization holding that the class division

is universally valid, the PFLP wrestled with the question of whether the

laws of class differentiation should be applied to various groups in the

'Zionist entity'. For the PFLP, this is a topic with both theoretical and

practical ramifications: the one hand, if the PFLP rejects the application

of the class division to Israel, it will be denying the central tenet of

Marxism-Leninism; yet on the other hand, if applies the principle to Israel,

that 'entity' will cease to constitute a wholly evil monolithic being,

and the PFLP will be forced to distinguish in it between the progressive

working classes and the reactionary classes.



<P>The ruling of the PFLP's doctrinal arbiters is destined to resolve this

dilemma. In their view, the 'Zionist entity', like any other society, does

in fact consist of a group of classes. However, at the present time the

element that binds it together - its being 'a settling society possessing

a Zionist ideology' - is more powerful than the elements of class differentiation,

According to the PFLP, all the classes in Israel are benefiting 'from the

acts of plunder and suppression' against the Palestinians, hence the possibility

of taking advantage of the class disparities and modifying them from within

is negligible.



<P>The PFLP's dismissal of the importance of the class division where Israel

is concerned at this stage is consistent with its effort to blur as far

as possible the class barriers within the Palestinian society. Although

the PFLP seeks to oust the Fatah, which it considers the representative

of the Palestinian bourgeoisie, from its position of leadership, it is

careful to stress that it does not wish to oust it from the broad Palestinian

consensus. Thus, for example - in the past the PFLP did not flinch from

excoriating the Fatah dissidents led by Abu-Musa - although their opinion

of Arafat similar to that of the PFLP - for having sparked a fratricidal

conflict. This practical decision follows from the PFLP's perception that

the current period is characterized by a struggle for national liberation

in which the conflict with Israel constitutes he terms the 'primary contradictions

which is shunting aside the significance of the 'secondary contradictions'

within the Palestinian society. It follows that in the stage of national

liberation, every nuance of Marxism-Leninism needs to be adhered to. As

ideological authority for this approach, the PFLP cites passages from the

writings of Lenin, whereas in its early period, before dissociating itself

from Chinese Communism, it drew inspiration from the writings and deeds

of Mao TseTung who fought shoulder to shoulder with Chinese 'reactionism'

(the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek) until the Japanese invader was driven

out.



<P>In principle, the PFLP holds that Israel and Zionism are one and the

same. This approach does away with the conceptual acrobatics engaged in

by some leaders of the pragmatic current in the Fatah (such as Khalid al-Hasan

who draws a distinction between the extensive Zionist Israel whose territorial

expansionism expresses its entire essence, and a narrow Israel with which

coexistence will be possible once it divests itself of the territorial

assets it obtained in 1967. It is the PFLP's view that as long as Israel

exists, no matter how shrunken, it constitutes the very core that harbors

within it the 'evil spirit’ of Zionism. The PFLP rarely refers to Israel

by name; instead, euphemisms such as 'the Zionist enemy' or 'the Zionist

entity' are employed, and the conflict is referred to as the Arab - Zionist

conflict’. In his polemical wrangling with the 'Palestinian Right' (i.e.,

Fatah) George Habash formulated this approach succinctly: Can Israel be

differentiated from the Zionist movement? Is Israel not the economic, military

and political embodiment of the Zionist movement? Is it possible to sweep

away Zionism without sweeping away Israel?



<P>Wholly consistent with its principled approach, the PFLP roundly condemns

every meeting of Fatah personnel with Israelis who identify themselves

as Zionists willing to recognize the determination of the Palestinian people.

Nevertheless, the installation into practice of the principle of absolute

identity between Israel and Zionism is also flawed by contradictions. For

example, the PFLP sees a wide field 'for practical cooperation against

Zionism and imperialism with certain trends in Israel, such as the Israeli

Communist Party (Rakah), which reject Zion while not rejecting the existence

of Israel itself. The excuse offered by the PFLP for this approach is that

such cooperation stems from practical and concrete considerations and does

not attest to any deviation from its opposition in principle to the existence

of Israel.



<P>At this point the difference between the practical approach to Israel

within the Fatah, and that of the PFLP, is clear. Whereas the emergent

tendency in the Fatah is to distinguish between groups within Zionism with

which business can be conducted, and other groups with which such dealings

are barred, the PFLP professes to see no distinction between currents within

Zionism. Unlike the pragmatic wing in the Fatah, it does not search for

any response from the enemy - the US and Israel - nor does it even wish

for such a response. Hence it has no interest whatever in any internal

differentiation within Israel. Habash has often declared that he prefers

the Likud in power in Israel over the Alignment, since in his view the

former says frankly what the latter actually thinks but conceals under

a stylistic wrapping.



<P>For George Habash the powerful shock that racked Israel in the wake

of the Lebanon war is proof positive that Israel can be eliminated in a

long-term process based on the principle of attrition. It is his belief

that if the Arabs manage to prevent Israel from achieving a decisive blow

in a lightning war, they can, by dint of their 'steadfastness and resistance',

forment within Israel international tremors which will effect its disintegration:

'The 1982 war was indicative of the possibility of causing the Zionist

entity to implode by dealing powerful blows from outside and causing it

heavy losses'.



<P>Habash is absolutely convinced that a war between Israel and Syria -

initiated by the former with American assent - is on the cards; it is only

a matter of timing. As for the more remote future, the PFLP's weekly occasionally

discusses Israel's demographic hardship, a subject it turned to with great

interest following the publication of the Professor Baki's Demographic

Report to the Israeli Government. The PFLP takes heart from the emerging

demographic trends - to which, it believes, Israel has no answer. At the

same time, however, it cautions against a stand-pat approach while what

it terms 'the laws of nature' take their course, urging instead that the

issue be brought to a head and that Israel even before then, be overcome

by brute force.
