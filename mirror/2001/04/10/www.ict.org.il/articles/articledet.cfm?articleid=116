<p><p><b>Historical background</b>
<br>Just as Islam spread from the Middle East to Inner Asia and from Afghanistan
to India, so it spread from various parts of India to the Malay Peninsula
and the Indonesian archipelago in the late thirteenth, fourteenth, and
fifteenth centuries. Islam was introduced into maritime Southeast Asia
and flourished in conditions rather different from those of the Middle
East and the Indian subcontinent. While Islam was established in other
regions by Arab or Turkish conquests, it was introduced into Southeastern
Asia by traveling merchants and Sufis. Whereas in the Middle East and India,
Muslim regimes were consolidated by new elites, in Southeastern Asia existing
regimes were consolidated by conversion to Islam. The continuity of elites
gave strong expression to the pre-Islamic components of Southeast Asian-Islamic
civilization. In the regions of Indonesia and Malaysia an overwhelming
majority of the population eventually accepted an Islamic identity while
Muslims remained a minority in the Philippines.[1]
<p>Muslims in the Philippines, also called Moros constitute 5% of the Philippines’
population,[2] and are concentrated in the southern part of the country.
These Muslims are Sunnis who generally adhere to the <i>Shafii</i> School
of Islamic law (<i>madhhab</i>). For centuries, the Muslims in the southern
Philippines constituted independent sultanates.[3] Successfully avoiding
Spanish conquest, they gradually fell under U.S. sovereignty. The U.S.
made them become part of an independent Philippines in 1946, a move the
Muslims viewed as a betrayal of a trust. Prior to independence, the vast
majority did not consider themselves Filipinos and retained their identity
as a separate people.[4]
<p>This identity was essentially religious and cultural in nature. Most
of the Muslim leaders had wished to separate from the rest of the Philippines
to form an independent state. For decades, the Muslims had vainly resisted
the encroachment of Christian settlers (under government assistance) on
their traditional lands. Years of economic neglect and political discrimination
had reduced them to the lowest national literacy and economic levels. Unemployment
was endemic; law and order had deteriorated in some areas. That Filipino
national leaders in Manila viewed Muslims and their lands in much the same
way as Spanish and American colonial authorities had done before them was
met with deep suspicion and fierce resentment. Significantly, government
programs to integrate Muslims into body politic were paralleled by growth
of Islamic revivalism.[5]
<p>After the establishment of the Philippine Republic in 1946, some members
of the Muslim political elite aligned themselves with the policies of the
new state, including state sponsorship of large-scale Christian migration
to the Muslim South.[6] The principal leaders of the nationalist separatist
movement that began taking concrete form in the late 1960’s were young
men from non-elite Muslim families who had attended universities in Manila
on government scholarships expressly intended to integrate Muslims into
the Philippine nation. In the Muslim South, those separatist leaders were
eventually able to attract popular support because established Muslim leaders
failed to effectively prevent the massive Christian migration.
<p>When the separatist movement seemed likely to achieve some success,
certain of the established elites, who had opposed the separatist rebellion
and collaborated with the state in 1960’s, now joined the rebel leaders
in overseas exile and attempted to gain control of the movement. At the
same time the Philippine government followed the policy of integrating
some of the prominent rebel commanders into the state bureaucracy. It simply
offered them official positions allowing them to govern large numbers of
Muslims on the condition of defecting from the separatist cause and activities.
From their new positions, some of the defectors protected Muslim civilians
from the attacks of the Philippine army. As a result they were viewed as
heroes by many ordinary Muslims who remained nonetheless committed to the
separatist struggle.[7]
<p>Events in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s further alienated the Muslims
and forced them to arm themselves. Examples include the massacre of Muslim
trainees by the Philippine military in March 1968, communal clashes between
Muslims and Christians (in which the constabulary and police often sided
with the Christians), the gradual loss of Muslim communal lands to settlers.
Added to this were the effects of the November 1971 elections, which led
Christian politicians, with the help of Marcos and the ruling party, to
capture many provincial and municipal offices in traditional Muslim areas,
as well as the rise of well-armed Christian paramilitary forces. Beginning
in 1969, scores of Muslim youth were trained abroad in the Malaysian State
of Sabah in guerilla warfare. Their return has helped secure the defense
of their communities.[8]
<p><b>The Moro National Liberation Front</b>
<br>When martial law was declared in September 1972 by the authoritarian
regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, government attempts to disarm Muslims,
who feared Christian armed groups as well as military retaliation provoked
open rebellion. Foremost in this struggle was the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF),[9] whose founders were among those Muslim youth trained abroad.
<p>A central committee whose original members crossed regional and linguistic
lines guided the MNLF. Its chairman, Nur Misuary, was a faculty member
at the University of Philippines. Even before his training abroad, Misuary
had argued that only through a free and independent state could the Muslims
free themselves from corrupt leaders and fully implement Islamic institutions.
To him, the Moros constituted a separate people—the <i>Bangsamoro</i> people.
Misuary’s concept had a nationalistic connotation such that non-Muslims
who cast their lot with Muslims were also to be called “Moros” and therefore
as members of the future Bangsamoro Republic. Ever since the nationalist
movement took concrete form it has been a movement directed toward self-determination
and independence, defined as a prerequisite for the unhindered implementation
and enhancement of Islamic institutions among the Muslim in the Philippines.
<p>The war in the southern Philippines resulted in the death of thousands
of soldiers and civilians and the flight of several hundred thousand refugees.
Charges of genocide gained for the Moros the sympathy and concern of the
international Muslim community. Libya provided sanctuary for some of the
top MNLF leaders and did not deny that it had provided various forms of
aid.[10] The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and other Muslim
international organizations continually exerted pressure on the Philippine
government to negotiate for a peaceful settlement with the leaders of the
Muslim armed struggle, particularly the MNLF.[11]
<p><b>The Tripoli Agreement</b>
<br>In December 1976, with the aid of Libyan intervention, and under the
auspices of the OIC, Philippine government officials and MNLF leaders were
able to negotiate a settlement in Tripoli, Libya. Called the Tripoli Agreement,
the settlement called the cease-fire and the granting of autonomy to thirteen
provinces where the majority of Muslims lived.[12] Marcos then set out
in early 1977 to provide a form of autonomy in accordance with his government’s
own definition. Meanwhile, the Bangsa Moro Liberation Organization (BMLO)
was formally organized by two traditional leaders living as expatriates
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: Rashid Lucman, a former congressman and sultan
among his people in Lanao Province, and Salipada Pendatum, an ex-congressman
and member of the Maguindanao nobility of Cotabato Province. They proclaimed
the BMLO to be the leader of the Muslim struggle in the Philippines.[13]
<p>Rashid Lucman felt that he should have full control of the MNLF because
of his claimed traditional prerogatives. This was not possible as long
as Nur Misuary, who belonged to another ethno-linguistic group and a different
social class, was chairman. Consequently, the BMLO conspired with Salamat
Hashim, vice-chairman of the MNLF Central Committee, to claim or seize
leadership of the MNLF on the grounds that Misuary had leftist leanings
and had abandoned the collegial character of the committee. Salamat Hashim
was a nephew of Salipada Pendatum and related to the Maguindanao nobility;
he had received extensive religious training at al-Azhar University, in
Egypt.
<p>In December 1977, Salamat issued a declaration of takeover and informed
the OIC accordingly. But Misuary with the aid of his loyal followers held
fast to his position and expelled Salamat Hashim. In response, Salamat
asserted his independence and transferred his base of operations to Cairo.
Because the BMLO had failed to control the MNLF, by 1978 there were three
groups claiming to head the Muslim movement in the Philippines: the MNLF-Misuary
faction, the MNLF-Salamat faction (later renamed MILF – Moro Islamic Liberation
Front)[14], and the BMLO.[15]
<p><b>The influence of Iran</b>
<br>When Iran’s revolutionary government took power in 1979, both leaders
of the MNLF-Misuary faction and the BMLO praised the revolution as a reassertion
of Islamic principles.[16] The MNLF-Salamat faction avoided any statement
since it was under the Egyptian influence. Rashid Lucman, as well as Nur
Misuary visited Teheran in 1979. The case of the MNLF-Misuary faction attracted
much attention. After the Misuary’s visit, the Ayatollah Khomeini, leader
of the Iranian Revolution prayed openly for the success of the Muslim revolutionary
struggle in the Philippines. He assured Misuary that “the victory of the
Islamic Revolution of Iran would not be complete until the oppressed Bangsamoro
Muslims in the southern Philippines won their victory.”
<p>The Iran visit was a serious morale booster for Misuary and his aides,
particularly after what they had had to endure from BMLO intrigues, Salamat
Hashim’s breakaway, and the surrender of several top MNLF commanders to
the Philippine government. One can speculate that officials of Iran’s new
regime might have been wary about dealing with the BMLO, whose leadership
represented dynastic and vested interests in traditional Moro society.[17]
Misuary and his delegation members, who were relatively young men, must
have appeared as sincere and dedicated. At any rate, compared with the
other factions, Misuary commanded the largest fighting group. This relationship
eventually resulted in an Iranian oil embargo against the Philippines (about
4.16% of the annual oil import) in November 1979 in response to the continuing
massacre of the Muslims by the Marcos regime and the refusal of the Philippine
government to implement the Tripoli Agreement of 1976.[18]
<p>The Iranian oil embargo represented a victory for the MNLF. It was the
first international Muslim intervention in Philippines domestic politics.
This provided the MNLF with greater confidence and led Misuary to revert
to his original demand, as set forth in the Tripoli Agreement, for secession
instead of autonomy. Meanwhile, the BMLO continued its agitation for full
implementation of the Tripoli Agreement. Marcos denied all accusations
by announcing to the world that the Agreement was in fact being implemented.
Failing to convince the OIC, he countered with the argument that since
there were three organizations claiming leadership of the Muslims, he did
not know with whom to negotiate, in spite of the fact the OIC had recognized
the MNLF with Misuary as its chairman.[19]
<p>In November 1980, the MNLF office in Teheran was given official recognition
by the Iranian government. A reception hosted by the director of the office
to mark the occasion was attended by representatives of at least six embassies
of Muslim countries affiliated with Iran. It was around this time that
Iranian officials tried to bring about a reconciliation between Salamat
Hashim and Nur Misuary. The former was invited to Teheran, but considering
the strained relations between Iran and Egypt, Salamat’s host country,
he found it prudent not to accept.[20]
<p><b>Separatism after the cease-fire</b>
<br>Following the cease-fire agreement in 1976 the separatist struggle
in the Philippines Muslim South gradually transformed itself into a popular-based,
mostly unarmed movement. This was accompanied by an ideological shift away
from traditionalism and toward Islamic renewal. That cultural project,
however, received a mixed reception from ordinary Muslims, who resisted
many of the social and ritual modifications promoted by movement leaders.
<p>When strong antagonisms between the Philippine State and Muslim nationalists
erupted into armed rebellion in the late 1960’s, rebels rallied to the
separatist cause, and the nationalist movement eventually received broad
popular support. Muslim subordinates nevertheless evaluated the pronouncements
of movement leaders based on their separate shared experience. Those evaluations
were made independently of authorized discourse and led at times to actions
that not only deviated from the official aims of the separatist movement
but effectively thwarted them. Ordinary Muslims were equally skeptical
of the hegemonic project of the State and its Muslim collaborators, measuring
the ideological pronouncements against their own life experience.[21]
<p>The peace agreement, which called for the establishment of a “Muslim
Autonomous Region” in the southern Philippines, was never genuinely implemented
by the Marcos administration. As a consequence, fighting broke out once
more before the end of 1977, but did not again approach the level of intensity
experienced prior to the cease-fire. The Muslim separatist movement entered
a period of disarray marked by factional infighting and a weakening of
popular support. By the early 1980s it had refashioned itself in the South
into a mass-based and self-declared Islamic movement guided by Islamic
clerics. With the fall of the Marcos regime in 1985, movement leaders (with
the now-modified aim of genuine political autonomy for Philippine Muslims)
fully adopted the practices of popular politics. They organized mass demonstrations
to petition the government for political autonomy and formed an Islamic
political party to contest provincial elections. In most of those endeavors
they received substantial support from ordinary Muslims.[22]
<p><b>The emergence of Abu Sayyaf</b>
<br>In 1991, a radical group, which disagreed with the peace process between
the Muslims and the State, left the MNLF and formed the <a href="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=3">Abu Sayyaf Group</a>
(Bearer of the Sword). Its main purpose is to establish an Islamic state,
based on the Islamic law (<i>Shariah</i>) in the southern Philippines.
The emergence of Abu Sayyaf is indicative of an important shift within
the Muslim Nationalist movement of the Philippines. It represents a process
towards the Islamization of the Moro identity and the formalization of
the already existing Islamic trend within the MNLF. The nationalist essence
of the MNLF was incorporated into the Abu Sayyaf’s protracted struggle
for Islamization of the Moro community, entailing operational transformation
of the movement.
<p>The founder of Abu Sayyaf was Abduragak Abubakar Janjalani, who led
the group until December 1998, when was killed by the police in the Lamitan
village in Basilan Island.[23] Janjalani was a veteran of the Afghan war
and during his participation in the war he developed close ties with other
Islamic radical groups. He strongly opposed the peace process between the
government of the Philippines and the MNLF, and demanded an independent
Islamic state. After his death, his brother, Khaddafy Janjalani, emerged
as the new leader.
<p>Abu Sayyaf rejects the practice of the complementary non-violent mobilization
(<i>Dawa</i>) since violent struggle (<i>Jihad</i>) corresponds to the
group’s ideological strategy, while moderation of the struggle constitutes
an inevitable acceptance of the MNLF’s “concessions” to the State. Since
its inception, Abu Sayyaf has competed with the MNLF for the leadership
of the Moros’ national struggle. During the 1970’s and 1980’s, the Moros
nationalist main-stream political force did not take any measures against
the Islamists’ increasing role in the arena of the armed struggle, acknowledging
their contribution to the overall effort to drive the Philippines’ government
to make political and territorial concessions. During those years, therefore,
the Islamists faced only pressures imposed by the state authorities to
their course of action.
<p><b>Abu Sayyaf at a crossroads</b>
<br>Now however, both the state and the mainstream MNLF operate to limit
the scope of Abu Sayyaf’s growing influence. Under the changing atmosphere
and circumstances in the Southern Philippines through the peace process,
Abu Sayyaf’s sensational terrorist activities may consolidate the basis
for the continuation of Jihad, and turn the movement into an alternative
political force to the mainstream MNLF. The resort to violence, through
the conduct of the armed struggle against the State may entail Abu Sayyaf’s
increasing political influence among the Moros. Such a development would
pose a serious threat for the Muslim nationalist movement, since criticism
and opposition threaten to weaken it from within if the peace process fails
once again to meet the expectations of the Muslim community of the Philippines.
<p>Alternately, should Abu Sayyaf choose to conduct a non-violent struggle
against the State, the group could find itself on a track of decline since
such developments could be perceived as a diversion from the Islamic aim
of its struggle. Therefore, the group’s options are clear-cut.
<p>Abu Sayyaf’s Islamic ideology has guided the articulation of radical
objectives and strategy. The group’s choices of action have primarily reflected
the search for policy shifts among those radical Muslims who perceive the
ongoing peace process as a threat. Furthermore, the choice of sensational
terrorist actions, like bombings and kidnappings of foreigners placed Abu
Sayyaf’s struggle on the international agenda. Against the backdrop of
the evolving—albeit problematic and shaky—peace process between the MNLF
and the government, threading this fine line is a challenge to Abu Sayyaf’s
survival.
