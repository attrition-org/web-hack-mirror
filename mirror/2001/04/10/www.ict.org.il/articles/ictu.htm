Unit</font></b></center>

<p><b>Eric Herren</b>
<br><b>ICT consultant</b> 
<p><b>Preface</b>
<br>In an article titled “Countering State-Sponsored Terrorism” Boaz Ganor
proposes the establishment of an International Institution to Fight Terrorism.
This assumes that the international community has arrived at an accepted
definition of terrorism, and the concomitant establishment of a permanent
international mechanism to combat terrorism.
<p>One of the first benefits of such a step would be that democracies with
less experience in combating terrorism would no longer be as powerless
when confronted by the threat of terrorism
<p>Among the other notable benefits of international consent regarding
counter-terrorist policies would be the ability to set up an International
Counter-Terrorist Unit. (ICTU).
<p>This article will focus on the possible structure and environment of
such a multinational tool in the struggle against terrorism. We will not
deal here with the necessary political circumstances and arrangements surrounding
its use.
<p><b>Theoretical Basis</b>
<br>In order to counter the variety of threats from modern terrorism such
a unit would have to interface smoothly with the existing network of cooperation
between security and intelligence services. The ground already cleared
by international experience and expertise would be the soil in which such
a unit could grow. Considerable international effort in this field would
be necessary to provide the unit with substantial information, warnings
and inside intelligence.
<p><img SRC="../graphics/ctu4.gif" height=200 width=256 align=RIGHT>Our
“Future Force,” put together from the best available soldiers and specialists
from various nations should have a sister organization working in the field
of intelligence. This unit, like its sister unit, would have the task of
providing the international community with a flexible, multinational instrument
against threats from multiple vectors. Both forces should be capable of
conducting missions against all possible terrorist tactics, including cyber-attacks.
In order to cope with new forms of terrorism—non-state actors and post-modern
terrorists—the defense posture, training, equipment and tactical structure
of the world’s military, intelligence, security and law enforcement communities
has to be redirected and refocused into a international rather than a national
format.
<p><b>Operational Environment</b>
<br>The shift in focus from a national or bipolar theater to a world/regional
scenario will necessitate a number of modifications on the tactical and
strategic level. The force must be rapidly deployable. In overall concept
such a force will need to operate in close cooperation with the local units
that will be first on the scene. The International Unit must be trained
to respond to a variety of crisis scenarios with exceptionally flexibility.
The instability of the current international environment requires the ability
to adapt. The international approach to Counter-Terrorism must overcome
the limitations of the present national forces. International cooperation
and exchange of technical and tactical soft-and hardware would be essential
for the success of any operation.
<p>At the same time we must take into account the exceptional requirements
for security regarding the exchange of such sensitive data. Today a number
of former members of Special Forces are selling know-how to private organizations
and individuals. For the most part, this consists of techniques and tactics
no longer in use. However, any such information can hint at further developments
and can thus provide an idea of the actual level of capability. The new
character of the operational environment—the broad scope of the potential
threat, combined with sophisticated terrorist strategies—demands extraordinary
efforts to preserve in secrecy the actual capabilities of counter-terrorist
forces.
<p><b>Structure of an International Counter Terrorist Unit</b>
<br><img SRC="../graphics/ctu3.gif" height=206 width=245 align=RIGHT>The
international force could be made up of fighters from existing national
counter terrorist units, who would enlist in the Unit for a limited time.
The ICTU could be split up into several operating squadrons, each with
its own multi-region operational area, based on existing resources and
personnel. National experience and various specialized abilities (language,
cultural background etc.) would enhance the overall capability of the team.
The individual fighter would remain with the Unit for several years, rather
than for a certain period of each year. One of the skills selected for
in the team’s members would be the ability to integrate successfully into
a new formation.
<p>Existing international organizations in other fields prove the advantage
of international cooperation. To give only one example, the Unit’s training
can take advantage of the instruction of external experts and the use of
qualified international educational teams under both inter-unit and external
supervision.
<p><b>Research and Development</b>
<br>One innovation in the structure of regular counter terrorist unit would
be the augmentation of the tactical intelligence section to include a research
and development division. Research and development are not only necessary
tools for the technical section; they also stimulate a better understanding
of tactical and operational aspects of the force within the intelligence
branch. Tactics and/or techniques must be adapted to new technical equipment
or intelligence information.
<p>Research projects and links to academic research organizations would
also be a task of the intelligence branch. This section of ICTU would be
in charge of the contacts with local and national counter terrorist units.
To have the greatest possible strike capability such a unit needs the opportunity
to train jointly with local and national units around the world. The intelligence
section would provide the liaison between the Unit and other forces. Its
officers would determine areas of common interest and exchange with other
institutions.
<p>Such a unit could also provide limited training and effective know-how
to friendly states in order to improve their capability in countering terrorism.
There should be the possibility for participating nations to send observers
as part of the intelligence branch within ICTU. This give-and-take on the
national and international level would lay the groundwork for unlimited
cooperation in selected fields of the Unit’s activities, thus greatly improving
the overall effectiveness of the organization. All available international
resources could be used to accomplish increasingly difficult tasks.
<p><b>Psychological Advantages to International Cooperation</b>
<br>Because of its international character the Unit could make the most
efficient use of human resources, by easily integrating the individual
expertise of different cultural characteristics. New tasks of the counter-terrorist
unit must include participation in combined reconnaissance operations including
the monitoring, infiltration and destruction of the terrorist’s capability
wherever they are found.
<p><img SRC="../graphics/ctu2.gif" height=211 width=207 align=LEFT>Any
intervention carried out by an international counter-terrorist unit would
be a legal act according to the agreements concerning the definition of
terrorism. Such activity would seriously damage the “hit and run” guerilla
tactics of terrorist organizations and may force them into a more defensive
position. Turning the tables on the terrorist organizations would send
a clear message to terrorist organizations that terrorist tactics will
not be tolerated by the international community. The international response
to an organization’s crossing the red line by using terrorism (attacks
on civilians) as an instrument of political policy can thus be unambiguous
and unanimous (supported by the international community through their support
for the ICTU).
<p>But the primary psychological advantage of the existence of such an
International Counter-Terrorist Unit would be the fact that any terrorist
action would be met by the full force of all the world’s resources, and
not by those of one nation alone. Of course one can say that in establishing
such an instrument the international community is merely playing into the
hands of the terrorists. After all, one of the goals of terrorism is to
provoke a government over-reaction and moviolent persecution of certain
groups. However, if we analyze the history of counter-terrorist operations
it can be shown that the more professional the forces involved, the higher
the precision of strike capability and the less need for the kind of uncoordinated
violence on which terrorism thrives.
<p><b>Summary</b>
<br>A rational look at current international affairs raises the possibility
that the problem of terrorism is not yet great enough to bring the international
community to make common cause. It would be self-delusion to think that
the establishment of an International Counter-Terrorist Unit could solve
the problem by itself. But the battle against terrorism and its perpetrators
needs to be discussed on the level of international military and intelligence
tools regardless of the possibilities of establishing such a unit. The
international response and countermeasures to terrorist actions should
be directed against those responsible and their supporters at all levels.
We are only beginning to reach an understanding of the destructive potential
of terrorism and its influence on the sensitive world balance.
<p>Terrorists have become a major force on the international scene. Together
with the network of organized crime, terrorist organizations have become
a lethal cross-border tool used by groups and states for political and
strategic purposes. Terrorism has the potential to become a serious strategic
threat to each and every nation.
<p>The independent counter-terrorist efforts of democracies swallows up
huge amounts of money, with little real impact. Even if an International
Counter-Terrorist Unit is far from realization, the existing forces need
much closer cooperation and development. The international struggle against
terrorism is only as strong as its weakest limb. Those nations with less
tactical experience in the field of countering terrorism are especially
in need of sharing the expertise of “combat-proven organizations.” The
saying that “all roads lead to Rome” naturally applies in this field, however
those who choose to “go it alone” may well pay for this independence with
possibly fatal results.
<p>In addition, terrorist organizations may benefit from the lack of international
cooperation by simply going for softer targets—in this case targets in
nations with less experience in dealing with terrorist activities. It is
a tragic mistake, often made by nations not currently under attack by terrorists,
to underestimate the threat to their own interests. This mistake impacts
negatively on the tendency of these nations to engage in international
cooperation to fight terrorism. Terrorism is “some one else’s problem.”
But in turning a blind eye on terrorist activity, so long as their own
interests are not affected, these nations by their refusal to take a stand
inadvertently provide the soil in which international terrorism can grow
and flourish. It is only a matter of time before the phenomenon of terrorism
moves from the television screens into the living space of these nations.
