<p>On January 30-31<sup>st</sup>, 1999, the council of Arab Interior Ministers
held its 16th meeting in Amman in an effort to consolidate a united policy
on counter-terrorism, and to reaffirm the Arab counter-terrorism accords
of April 1998. A general statement was issued “rejecting terrorism in all
its forms,” while the participants vowed to “make any effort to fight terrorism.”
They also gave their backing to an international conference to be held
under the auspices of the United Nations. The statement distinguished between
“terrorism and the right of people to struggle against foreign occupation
and aggression by all means including armed struggle.”
<p>An important element of the statement was a “promise to furnish all
necessary aid to the Palestinian police,” and the agreement that “every
state will separately coordinate its support for the Palestinian police
with Arafat.”
<p>The discussions of the meeting were closed to the Media and so far there
has been very little information in the Arab Media. One exceptional was
the weekly <i>Al- Sabil</i>, the organ of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood
and a prominent supporter of Hamas.
<p>The interest of the Islamic movements in this meeting is obvious, because
terrorism in our period in the Arab World implies primarily the various
Islamic organizations and groups, which act in the framework of an Islamist
fundamentalist or radical terrorism. The Islamic weekly therefore, chose
to emphasize the disputes between various Arab states in this meeting.
<p>According to <i>Al-Sabil</i>, many states, lead by Syria, had expressed
disagreement with the accords, especially with regard to the extradition
of criminals from one state to another. For this reason, only seven Arab
states have thus far signed the accords: Jordan, The United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Sudan, plus the Palestinian
Authority. According to <i>Al-Sabil</i>, so far only five states have presented
their approval of the accords to the general secretariat of the Council
of Arab Ministers of Interior.
<p>Observers have pointed out that although the last meeting had expressed
“the right of people to struggle against occupation and aggression,” there
was no mention of Israel or “Israeli terrorism,” in contrast to the previous
convention on April 1998. According to the secretary general of the council
Dr. Ahmad al-Salim in his press conference, the denial of terrorism by
the meeting “includes all the countries that initiate terrorism.”
<p>Another disputed issue in the present meeting was the definition of
terrorism, despite the fact that the Arab Interior ministers had already,
at their meeting in Tunis in 1989, arrived at the following definition:
<blockquote>“Terrorism is every organized act of violence or threatening
by violence that causes terror and fear, such as killing, assassination,
kidnapping of hostages, airplanes or ships, and the use of bombing, aimed
at achieving political objectives.”</blockquote>
The Islamic weekly obviously viewed with great antagonism and anxiety,
the particular decision of the ministers of Interior expressing support
for the Palestinian police. Naturally they see this article as aimed specifically
against Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic groups. This general Arab support
should be seen on the background of the arrests of hundreds of Hamas activists
in the past year, together with the American involvement in Palestinian
counter-terrorism as a consequence of the Wye River Accords.
<p>To sum up, we can conclude that the issue of counter-terrorism in the
Arab world will probably continue to be in dispute. For the tendency to
legitimize the struggle against Israel is a two-edged sword. It cuts both
ways—against Israel—and against secular Arab regimes, which suffer from
Islamist terrorism no less than does Israel.
