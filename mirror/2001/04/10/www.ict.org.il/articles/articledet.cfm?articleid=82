Islam at Large:
<br><font size=3>The Drive for Power</font></h2></center>

East Quarterly</a> in June 1996</i></font>

<p><p>As the century closes, two words,
Islam and fundamentalism, have become intimately linked in English usage.
The <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English</i> now defines <i>fundamentalism</i>
as the “strict maintenance of ancient or fundamental doctrines of any religion,
especially Islam.” However problematic this formula, it does acknowledge
that fundamentalism in Islam is today the most visible and influential
of all fundamentalisms.
<p>The nature of fundamentalist Islam,
and even the use of the term, is hotly debated. But this debate is largely
a self-indulgent exercise of analysts. Within Islam, there are Muslims
who have created an “-ism” out of Islam — a coherent ideology, a broad
strategy, and a set of political preferences. They do not defy definition.
They defy the world.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>What Is Fundamentalist
Islam?</font></b></center>

<p>What is fundamentalist Islam? Its
contradictions seem to abound. On the one hand, it manifests itself as
a new religiosity, reaffirming faith in a transcendent God. On the other
hand, it appears as a militant ideology, demanding political action now.
Here it takes the form of a populist party, asking for ballots. There it
surges forth as an armed phalanx, spraying bullets. One day its spokesmen
call for a <i>jihad</i> (sacred war) against the West, evoking the deepest
historic resentments. Another day, its leaders appeal for reconciliation
with the West, emphasizing shared values. Its economic theorists reject
capitalist materialism in the name of social justice, yet they rise to
the defense private property. It moralists pour scorn on Western consumer
culture as debilitating to Islam, yet its strategists avidly seek to buy
the West’s latest technologies in order to strengthen Islam.
<p>Faced with these apparent contradictions,
many analysts in the West have decided that fundamentalism defies all generalization.
Instead they have tried to center discussion on its supposed “diversity.”
For this purpose, they seek to establish systems of classification by which
to sort out fundamentalist movements and leaders. The basic classification
appears in many different terminological guises, in gradations of subtlety.
<dir>
<dir>We need to be careful of that emotive
label, `fundamentalism’, and distinguish, as Muslims do, between revivalists,
who choose to take the practice of their religion most devoutly, and fanatics
or extremists, who use this devotion for political ends.[1]</dir>
</dir>
So spoke the Prince of Wales in a 1993
address, summarizing the conventional wisdom in a conventional way. The
belief that these categories really exist, and that experts can sort fundamentalists
neatly into them, is the sand on which weighty policies are now being built.
<p>Fundamentalist Islam remains an enigma
precisely because it has confounded all attempts to divide it into tidy
categories. “Revivalist” becomes “extremist” (and vice versa) with such
rapidity and frequency that the actual classification of any movement or
leader has little predictive power. They will not stay put. This is because
fundamentalist Muslims, for all their “diversity,” orbit around one dense
idea. From any outside vantage point, each orbit will have its apogee and
perigee. The West thus sees movements and individuals swing within reach,
only to swing out again and cycle right through every classification. Movements
and individuals arise in varied social and political circumstances, and
have their own distinctive orbits. But they will not defy the gravity of
their idea.
<p>The idea is simple: Islam must have
power in this world. It is the true religion—the religion of God—and its
truth is manifest in its power. When Muslims believed, they were powerful.
Their power has been lost in modern times because Islam has been abandoned
by many Muslims, who have reverted to the condition that preceded God’s
revelation to the Prophet Muhammad. But if Muslims now return to the original
Islam, they can preserve and even restore their power.
<p>That return, to be effective, must
be comprehensive; Islam provides the one and only solution to all questions
in this world, from public policy to private conduct. It is not merely
a religion, in the Western sense of a system of belief in God. It possesses
an immutable law, revealed by God, that deals with every aspect of life,
and it is an ideology, a complete system of belief about the organization
of the state and the world. This law and ideology can only be implemented
through the establishment of a truly Islamic state, under the sovereignty
of God. The empowerment of Islam, which is God’s plan for mankind, is a
sacred end. It may be pursued by any means that can be rationalized in
terms of Islam’s own code. At various times, these have included persuasion,
guile, and force.
<p>What is remarkable about fundamentalist
Islam is not its diversity. It is the fact that this idea of power for
Islam appeals so effectively across such a wide range of humanity, creating
a world of thought that crosses all frontiers. Fundamentalists everywhere
must act in narrow circumstances of time and place. But they are who they
are precisely because their idea exists above all circumstances. Over nearly
a century, this idea has evolved into a coherent ideology, which demonstrates
a striking consistency in content and form across a wide expanse of the
Muslim world.[2]

<p><b><font size=+1>Fundamentalist Forerunners</font></b></center>

<p><b>Afghani</b>
<p>The pursuit of power for Islam first gained some intellectual coherence
in the mind and career of Sayyid Jamal al-Din “al-Afghani” (1838-97), a
thinker and activist who worked to transform Islam into a lever against
Western imperialism. His was an age of European expansion into the heartlands
of Islam, and of a frenzied search by Muslims for ways to ward off foreign
conquest.
<p>In many respects, Afghani was the prototype of the modern fundamentalist.
He had been deeply influenced by Western rationalism and the ideological
mode of Western thought. Afghani welded a traditional religious hostility
toward unbelievers to a modern critique of Western imperialism and an appeal
for the unity of Islam, and while he inveighed against the West, he urged
the adoption of those Western sciences and institutions that might strengthen
Islam. Afghani spread his unsettling message in constant travels that took
him to Cairo, Istanbul, Tehran, and Kabul. He visited Paris, London, and
St. Petersburg as well, where he published and lobbied on behalf of revolutionary
change.
<p>A contemporary English admirer described Afghani as the leader of Islam’s
“Liberal religious reform movement.”[3]
But Afghani—not an Afghan at all, but a Persian who concealed his true
identity even from English admirers—was never what he appeared to be. While
he called for the removal of some authoritarian Muslim rulers, he ingratiated
himself with others. While he had great persuasive power, he did not shrink
from conspiracy and violence. A disciple once found him pacing back and
forth, shouting: “There is no deliverance except in killing, there is no
safety except in killing.”[4] These were not idle
words. On one occasion, Afghani proposed to a follower that the ruler of
Egypt be assassinated, and he did inspire a supple disciple to assassinate
a ruling shah of Iran in 1896. Afghani was tempted by power, and believed
that “power is never manifested and concrete unless it weakens and subjugates
others.” Quoting this and other evidence, one Arab critic has argued that
there is a striking correspondence between Afghani’s thought and European
fascism.[5]
<p>Was Afghani a liberal or a proto-fascist?
A reformist or a revolutionary? Was he the forerunner of those fundamentalists
who plead their case in political ways? Or those who open fire on the motorcades
of government ministers? Afghani was athese things, and one can only wonder
how today’s taxonomists (and with them, the Prince of Wales) would have
classified him. Some fundamentalists still pose this same intractable dilemma
of classification, although most of them have far weaker “liberal” and
“reformist” credentials than had Afghani.
<p><b>Banna</b>
<p>Between Afghani and the emergence
of full-blown fundamentalism, liberal and secular nationalism would enjoy
a long run in the lands of Islam. Europe had irradiated these lands with
the idea that language, not religion, defined nations. In the generation
that followed Afghani, Muslims with an eye toward Europe preferred to be
called Arabs, Turks, and Persians. “If you looked in the right places,”
wrote the British historian Arnold Toynbee in 1929, “you could doubtless
find some old fashioned Islamic Fundamentalists still lingering on. You
would also find that their influence was negligible.”[6]
Yet that same year, an Egyptian schoolteacher named Hasan al-Banna (1906-49)
founded a movement he called the Society of the Muslim Brethren. It would
grow into the first modern fundamentalist movement in Islam.
<p>The Muslim Brethren emerged against
the background of growing resentment against foreign domination. The Brethren
had a double identity. On one level, they operated openly, as a membership
organization of social and political awakening. Banna preached moral revival,
and the Muslim Brethren engaged in good works. On another level, however,
the Muslim Brethren created a “secret apparatus” that acquired weapons
and trained adepts in their use. Some of its guns were deployed against
the Zionists in Palestine in 1948, but the Muslim Brethren also resorted
to violence in Egypt. They began to enforce their own moral teachings by
intimidation, and they initiated attacks against Egypt’s Jews. They assassinated
judges and struck down a prime minister in 1949. Banna himself was assassinated
two months later, probably in revenge. The Muslim Brethren then hovered
on the fringes of legality, until Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had survived
one of their assassination attempts in 1954, put them down ruthlessly.
Yet the Muslim Brethren continued to plan underground and in prison, and
they flourished in other Arab countries to which they were dispersed.
<p><b>Safavi</b>
<p>At the same time, a smaller and more
secretive movement, known as the Devotees of Islam, appeared in Iran, under
the leadership of a charismatic theology student, Navvab Safavi (1923-56).
Like the Muslim Brethren, the Devotees emerged at a time of growing nationalist
mobilization against foreign domination. The group was soon implicated
in the assassinations of a prime minister and leading secular intellectuals.
The Devotees, who never became a mass party, overplayed their hand and
were eventually suppressed. Navvab himself was executed, after inspiring
a failed assassination attempt against another prime minister. But the
seed was planted. One of those who protested Navvab’s execution was an
obscure, middle-aged cleric named Ruhollah Khomeini, who would continue
the work of forging Islam and resentment into an ideology of power.
<p>In the checkered history of Afghani,
the Muslim Brethren, and the Devotees of Islam, clear patterns emerge.
They saw foreign domination as a symptom of Muslim weakness, and its elimination
as the key to Muslim power. Such domination could be attacked directly
by <i>jihad</i> against foreigners, or indirectly by promoting an Islamic
awakening. Those who gave priority to direct confrontation sometimes favored
alliances with other nationalists who opposed foreign rule. In Afghani’s
anti-imperialist campaign, especially against the British in Egypt, he
took all manner of nationalists as allies, including non-Muslims who became
some of his most ardent disciples. The Muslim Brethren, who joined the
attacks against the British presence in the Suez Canal zone, had many ties
to the Egyptian Free Officers who overthrew the monarchy in 1952, but their
vision of an Islamic state eventually made them bitter enemies of the new
regime. The Devotees of Islam, while thoroughly antiforeign, never collaborated
with secular nationalists, whom they deeply distrusted. Whatever their
strategies, however, they all worked to redress the gross imbalance of
power between Islam and the West.
<p>They also sought to replace weak
rulers and states with strong rulers and states. Such a state would have
to be based on Islam, and while its precise form remained uncertain, the
early fundamentalists knew it should not be a constitutional government
or multiparty democracy. Preoccupied with the defense of Islam and the
acquisition of power, they preferred the strong rule of a just and virtuous
Muslim. Afghani, the “Liberal,” did not advocate constitutional government.
His biographer, reviewing the famous Arabic newspaper published by Afghani
in Paris, has noted that “there is no word in the paper’s theoretical articles
favoring political democracy or parliamentarianism.” Afghani simply envisioned
“the overthrow of individual rulers who were lax or subservient to foreigners,
and their replacement by strong and patriotic men.”[7]
The Muslim Brethren in Egypt also rejected party politics. Banna demanded
the abolition of all political parties in Egypt and the creation of a single
Islamic party. Within this party there could be elections, but electoral
campaigning would be limited, voting would be compulsory, and elections
would be done by list, which Banna said would “liberate the representative
from the pressure of those who elected him.” Banna pointed to Stalin’s
Soviet Union as a model of a successful one-party system.[8]
Navvab also allowed elections, but all representatives had to be “devout
Muslims,” who would be kept “under the supervision of an assembly of pious
religious leaders in order to keep [their] activities in line with the
Islamic provisions.”[9] This preference for a strong,
authoritarian Islamic state, often rationalized by the claim that Islam
and democracy are incompatible, would become a trademark of fundamentalist
thought and practice.
<p>The pursuit of this strong utopian
state often overflowed into violence against weak existing states. These
“reformers” were quick to disclaim any link to the violence of their followers,
denying that their adepts could read their teachings as instructions or
justifications for killing. Afghani set the tone, following the assassination
of Iran’s shah by his disciple. “Surely it was a good deed to kill this
bloodthirsty tyrant,” he opined. “As far as I am personally concerned,
however, I have no part in this deed.”[10] Banna,
commenting on the assassinations and bombings done by the Muslim Brethren,
claimed that “the only ones responsible for these acts are those who commit
them.”[11] Navvab, who failed in his one attempt at
assassination, sent young disciples in his stead. For years he enjoyed
the protection of leading religious figures while actually putting weapons
in the hands of assassins.[12] (Only when abroad did
he actually boast. “I killed Razmara,” he announced on a visit to Egypt
in 1954, referring to the prime minister assassinated by a disciple three
years earlier.)[13] But despite the denials, violence
became the inescapable shadow of fundamentalist Islam from the outset—and
the attempt to separate figure from shadow, a problematic enterprise at
best.
<p>The fundamentalist forerunners also
determined that fundamentalist Islam would have a pan-Islamic bent. The
peripatetic Afghani took advantage of steamship and train, crossing political
borders and sectarian divides to spread his message of Islamic solidarity.
His Paris newspaper circulated far and wide in Islam, through the modern
post. Egypt’s Muslim Brethren also looked beyond the horizon. In 1948,
they sent their own volunteers to fight the Jews in Palestine. Over the
next decade, branches of the Muslim Brethren appeared across the Middle
East and North Africa, linked by publications and conferences. Egyptian
Brethren fleeing arrest set up more branches in Europe, where they mastered
the technique of the bank transfer.
<p>The fundamentalist foreruneven laid
bridges over the historic moat of Sunni prejudice that surrounded Shi`i
Iran. Iran’s Devotees of Islam mounted massive demonstrations for Palestine,
and recruited 5,000 volunteers to fight Israel. They were not allowed to
leave for the front, but Navvab himself flew to Egypt and Jordan in 1953,
to solidify his ties with the Muslim Brethren. Visiting the Jordanian-Israeli
armistice line, he had to be physically restrained from throwing himself
upon the Zionist enemy.[14] Navvab presaged those
Iranian volunteers who arrived in Lebanon thirty years later to wage Islamic
jihad against Israel.
<p>From the outset, then, fundamentalists
scorned the arbitrary boundaries of states, and demonstrated their resolve
to think and act across the frontiers that divide Islam. The jet, the cassette,
the fax, and the computer network would later help fundamentalists create
a global village of ideas and action—not a hierarchical “Islamintern” but
a flat “Islaminform”—countering the effects of geographic distance and
sectarian loyalty. Not only has the supposed line between “revivalist”
and “extremist” been difficult to draw. National and sectarian lines have
been erased or smudged, and fundamentalists draw increasingly on a common
reservoir for ideas, strategies, and support.
<p>A resolute anti-Westernism, a vision
of an authoritarian Islamic state, a propensity to violence, and a pan-Islamic
urge: these were the biases of the forerunners of fundamentalist Islam.
No subsequent fundamentalist movement could quite shake them. Indeed, several
thinkers subsequently turned these biases into a full-fledged ideology.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>An Ideology of Revolution</font></b></center>

<p>In the middle of this century of
ideologies, the fundamentalists set out to transform Islam into the most
complete and seamless ideology of them all. All-encompassing Islamic law,
based upon the Qur’an and the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad, constituted
their ideological manifesto and program. Many of the provisions of that
law had been remote ideals, enforced unevenly over the centuries by weak
states. Now fundamentalists, recognizing the enhanced coercive power of
the modern state, began to imagine that this law could be implemented in
its entirety, and that this total order would confer hitherto unimaginable
strength on the Islamic state. Fundamentalist ideology therefore insisted
not only on power, but on absolute power—an insistence, admits one advocate
of an Islamic state, that “has tended to make modern Islamists into proto-fascists,
obsessed with dragging their compatriots kicking and screaming into paradise.”[15]
<p><b>Mawdudi</font></b>
<p>Much of the ideological spadework
was done by Mawlana Abu’l-A`la Mawdudi (1903-79), the founder of the fundamentalist
Jama`at-i Islami in India and Pakistan. His many writings, translated into
every major language spoken by Muslims, provide a panoramic view of the
ideal fundamentalist state. In this state, sovereignty would belong to
God alone, and would be exercised on his behalf by a just ruler, himself
guided by a reading of God’s law in its entirety. As an ideological state,
it would be administered for God solely by Muslims who adhered to its ideology,
and “whose whole life is devoted to the observance and enforcement” of
Islamic law. Non-Muslims, who could not share its ideology, and women,
who by nature could not devote their entire lives to it, would have no
place in high politics. Everything would come under the purview of this
Islamic state. “In such a state,” announced Mawdudi, “no one can regard
any field of his affairs as personal and private. Considered from this
aspect the Islamic state bears a kind of resemblance to the Fascist and
Communist states,” although Mawdudi rejected individual dictatorship, instead
advocating a variety of one-party rule. Mawdudi was certain about what
the Islamic state would not resemble: it would be “the very antithesis
of secular Western democracy.”[16] Mawdudi himself
never had a sufficient following to make a concerted bid for power in Pakistan,
but his writings exerted a wide influence over fundamentalists better positioned
to act upon his vision.
<p><b>Qutb</font></b>
<p>Mawdudi’s ideas were carried to their
ultimate conclusion by an Egyptian Muslim Brother, Sayyid Qutb (1906-66).
Qutb borrowed heavily from Mawdudi’s vision of an Islamic state, but he
broke new ground in his analysis of how to realize it. Mawdudi had written
about the need for a “revolution” to create an Islamic state, but he believed
this revolution had to be prepared by a long campaign of persuasion. Qutb,
confined to one of Abdel Nasser’s prison camps when he wrote his major
work, was far more impatient. Islam was under assault, and redemption could
not wait for a bloodless revolution. Qutb urged that a believing vanguard
organize itself, retreat from impious society, denounce lax Muslims as
unbelievers, and battle to overturn the political order. As Qutb put it,
“those who have usurped the power of God on earth and made His worshippers
their slaves will not be dispossessed by dint of Word alone.”[17]
Qutb thus transformed what had been a tendency toward violence into an
explicit logic of revolution. He hardly had the chance to act on his theory,
for he spent almost a decade in prison before his final arrest and execution.
But later fundamentalists would return to his writings, to justify their
own resort to force.
<p>Qutb also placed the anti-imperialism
of the early fundamentalists on an ideological footing. He attributed his
own Islamic awakening to a period of more than two years spent in America
from 1948. America repelled him on every level. It was, he claimed, a disastrous
combination of avid materialism and egoistic individualism that commercialized
women and practiced a ferocious racism. Qutb went still further, claiming
that there existed something called “Crusaderism”—a systematic plan to
eradicate Islam linking medieval Christianity, modern imperialism, and
Western consumer culture. “Western blood carries the spirit of the Crusades
within itself,” wrote Qutb. “It fills the subconscious of the West.”[18]
Qutb’s work would later prove crucial to the fundamentalist rationale that
formal independence from the West had to be accompanied by a purging of
Islam’s own bloodstream of all Western cultural influence.
<p><b>Khomeini</font></b>
<p>It was Ruhollah Khomeini (1902-89)
who finally wrote the ideological formula for the first successful fundamentalist
revolution in Islam. Khomeini added nothing to fundamentalist ideology
by his insistence on the need for an Islamic state, created if necessary
by an Islamic revolution, but he made a breakthrough with his claim that
only the persons most learned in Islamic law could rule: “Since Islamic
government is a government of law, knowledge of the law is necessary for
the ruler, as has been laid down in tradition.” The ruler “must surpass
all others in knowledge,” and be “more learned than everyone else.”[19]
Since no existing state had such a ruler, Khomeini’s doctrine constituted
an appeal for region-wide revolution, to overturn every extant form of
authority and replace it with rule by Islamic jurists. In Iran, where such
jurists had maintained their independence from the state all along, this
doctrine transformed them into a revolutionary class, bent on the seizure
and exercise of power. Much to the astonishment of the world—fundamentalists
included—the formula worked, carrying Khomeini and his followers to power
on a tidal wave of revolution in 1979.
<p>Khomeini also revalidated the anti-Western
and anti-American credentials of fundamentalism. Qutb’s idea of “Crusaderism”
had worked particularly well in Egypt and the Levant, where the legacy
of the Crusades could be resurrected from the depths of collective Muslim
memory, but it did not speak to the people of Iran, a land untouched by
the Crusades. Khomeini thus drew a striking metaphor to make the same point:
America, historical heir to unbelief, was the “Great Satan.” This posited
an absolute conflict between Islam and the West, not just in history but
in eschatology.[20] It was dramatized by the seizure
of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran and the 444-day detentionof its staff. In
fundamentalist ideology, political conflict with the West was transformed
into a timeless cultural and religious conflict with the “enemies of Islam,”
led by America and represented on the ground by its proxy, Israel.
<p>Not all of Khomeini’s ideas had a
full impact on wider Islam. His legitimation of rule by Islamic jurists
proved difficult for other fundamentalist movements to assimilate, because
it assumed such jurists were inclined to take an oppositional stand. In
Sunni lands, Islamic jurists usually served the state, and Sunni movements
therefore tended to coalesce under lay leaders. Likewise, while Khomeini’s
anti-Americanism struck a deep chord, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
in 1980 diffused its impact. Sunni movements mobilized to wage an international
Islamic <i>jihad</i> against the Soviets, and were even ready to cooperate
temporarily with America to do so.
<p>Khomeini’s delegitimation of rule
by nominal Muslims kings and presidents, though, found a powerful echo,
and he demonstrated how a revolution might succeed in practice. Khomeini
also showed how cultural alienation could be translated into a fervid antiforeign
sentiment, an essential cement for a broad revolutionary coalition. Later
it would be assumed that only “extremists” beyond Iran were thrilled by
Iran’s revolution. In fact, the enthusiasm among fundamentalists was almost
unanimous. As a close reading of the press of the Egyptian Muslim Brethren
has demonstrated, even this supposedly sober movement approached the Iranian
revolution with “unqualified enthusiasm and unconditional euphoria,” coupled
with an “uncritical acceptance of both its means and goals.”[21]
Sunni doubts would arise about implementation of the Islamic state in Iran,
but for the next decade, much of the effort of fundamentalists would be
invested in attempts to replicate Khomeini’s success and bring about a
second Islamic revolution.
<p>The attempts to make a second revolution
demonstrated that fundamentalists of all kinds would employ revolutionary
violence if they thought it would bring them to power. Frustrated by the
drudgery of winning mass support, full of the heady ideas of Mawdudi and
Qutb, and inspired by Khomeini’s success, they lunged forward. From the
wild-eyed to the wily, Sunni fundamentalists of all stripes began to conspire.
A messianic sect seized the Great Mosque in Mecca in 1979. A group moved
by Qutb’s teachings assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
The Muslim Brethren declared a rebellion against the Syrian regime in 1982.
Another path of violence paralleled this one—the work of the half-dozen
Shi`i movements in Arab lands that had emerged around the hub of Islamic
revolution in Iran. They targeted their rage against the existing order
in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, and the smaller Gulf states. In
Iraq, they answered Khomeini’s appeal by seeking to raise the country’s
Shi`is in revolt in 1979. In Lebanon, they welcomed Iran’s Revolutionary
Guards in 1982, first to help drive out the Israelis, then to send suicide
bombers to blow up the barracks of U.S. and French peacekeepers there in
1983. Another Shi`i bomber nearly killed the ruler of Kuwait in 1985. Some
of Khomeini’s adepts went to Mecca as demonstrators, to preach revolution
to the assembled pilgrims. Others hijacked airliners and abducted foreigners.
Khomeini put a final touch on the decade when he incited his worldwide
following to an act of assassination, issuing a religious edict demanding
the death of the novelist Salman Rushdie in 1989.
<p>This violence was not an aberration.
It was a culmination. From the time of Afghani, fundamentalists had contemplated
the possibility of denying power through assassination, and taking power
through revolution. Because resort to political violence carried many risks,
it had been employed judiciously and almost always surreptitiously, but
it remained a legitimate option rooted firmly in the tradition, and it
became the preferred option after Iran’s revolution emboldened fundamentalists
everywhere. For the first time, the ideology of Islam had been empowered,
and it had happened through revolution. Power for Islam seemed within reach,
if only the fundamentalists were bold enough to run the risk. Many of them
were. They included not just the avowed revolutionaries of the Jihad Organization
in Egypt, but the cautious and calculating leaderships of the Muslim Brethren
in Syria and the Shi`i Da`wa Party in Iraq.
<p>It was a seesaw battle throughout
the 1980s. Nowhere was Iran’s experience repeated. The masses did not ignite
in revolution, the rulers did not board jumbo jets for exile. Regimes often
employed ruthless force to isolate and stamp out the nests of fundamentalist
“sedition.” Fundamentalists faced the gaol and the gallows in Egypt. Their
blood flowed in the gutters of Hama in Syria, Mecca in Saudi Arabia, and
Najaf in Iraq. Yet fundamentalists also struck blows in return, against
government officials, intellectuals, minorities, and foreigners. While
they did not take power anywhere, they created many semi-autonomous pockets
of resistance. Some of these pockets were distant from political centers,
such as the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and several governates of Upper Egypt,
but fundamentalists also took root in urban quarters and on university
campuses, where Islamic dress for women became compulsory and short-cropped
beards for men became customary. From time to time, impatient pundits would
proclaim that the tide of fundamentalist Islam had gone out, but its appeal
obviously ran much deeper. Its straightforward solution to the complex
crisis of state and society spoke directly to the poor and the young, the
overqualified and the underemployed, whose numbers were always increasing
faster than their opportunities.
<p>After Iran’s revolution and the subsequent
revolts, it was impossible to dismiss the ideological coherence fundamentalist
Islam had achieved. It had succeeded in resurrecting in many minds an absolute
division between Islam and unbelief. Its adherents, filled with visions
of power, had struck at the existing order, turned against foreign culture,
and rejected not only apologetics but politics—the pursuit of the possible
through compromise. Fundamentalism mobilized its adherents for conflict,
for it assumed that the power sought for Islam existed only in a finite
quantity. It could only be taken at the expense of others: rulers, foreigners,
minorities. Fundamentalists did not admit the sharing of this power, anymore
than they admitted the sharing of religious truth, and although fundamentalists
differed on the means of taking power, they were unanimous on what should
be done with it. One observer has written that even in Egypt, where the
fundamentalist scene seemed highly fragmented, the political and social
program of the violent fringe groups “did not seem to differ much from
that of the mainstream Muslim Brethren,” and was shared by “almost the
whole spectrum of political Islam.”[22] This was true,
by and large, for fundamentalist Islam as a whole.
<p><b>Repackaging the Islamic State</b>
<p>Yet at the same time, a younger generation
of thinkers added crucial refinements to the ideology, adapting it to the
times. Even fundamentalists could not reject the West in its entirety.
The West, despite fundamentalist faith in its ultimate decline, continued
to produce technologies and institutions that gave it immense power. Muslims,
to acquire that power, had to import these tools or risk being overwhelmed
completely. This next generation of thinkers imagined the Islamic state
not so much as a bulwark against the West, but as a filter screening the
flow of Western innovations and influences. This ideological filter would
admit whatever might enhance the power of the Islamic state and reject
whatever might diminish the unity and resolve of Islamic society. It took
a different kind of fundamentalist leader to play this role—Muslims who
knew the West’s strengths and weaknesses first-hand, who had themselves
come through the searing fire of its skepticism with their belief intact.
<p><b>Turabi</b>
<p>Sudan’s Hasan a<strike>l</strike>t-Turabi
(b. 1932) is the most notable representative of this successor generation.
Coming from a strong religious background, Turabi took a doctorate in law
at the Sorbonne from 1959 to 1964. Unlike Qutb, he was not altogether repelled
by his sojourn in the lands of unbelief: “I was excited by the richness
and precision of the French language, the culture, the history of the revolution,
the relations between church and state, and the study of the different
constitutions. I was not focused exclusively on my law studies. I went
to the national library, I visited museums.”[23] This
unique formation has helped to transform Turabi into the <i>ma&icirc;tre</i>
of contemporary “Islamism,” for he is presumed to know the West intimately
enough to decide what should be borrowed and what should be spurned. His
partnership with the military regime in Sudan, since 1989, has put him
in the best position of any contemporary fundamentalist to implement an
Islamic state.
<p><b>Ghannushi</b>
<p>Another member of this generation
is Rashid al-Ghannushi (b. 1941), leader of the Tunisian fundamentalist
movement.[24] Ghannushi took to the ideas of the Muslim
Brethren while studying philosophy in Damascus, where he also witnessed
the Arab debacle in June 1967. Ghannushi briefly continued his preparation
in philosophy at the Sorbonne in the crucial year of the 1968 student uprising.
By his own account, he read not only the works of Islamic philosophers,
but Descartes, Bacon, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Althusser.[25]
But on his return to Tunisia, he preferred to teach the ideas of Mawdudi,
Banna, and Qutb to an emerging fundamentalist movement. Ghannushi repeatedly
ran afoul of the Tunisian authorities, and in 1989 chose voluntary exile.
He is now a political refugee in Britain, where he plays the role of the
foremost defender of Islamism in the West. His region-wide stature derives
from the fact that he speaks knowingly from the belly of the beast.
<p><b>Fadlallah</b>
<p>A third figure of comparable stature,
certainly among Shi`is, is Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah (b. 1936) of
Lebanon. Fadlallah, born in Iraq of Lebanese Shi`i descent, is a product
of the Shi`i academies of Najaf in Iraq. But even there, he was drawn to
study the forbidden knowledge of philosophers and unbelievers, as he himself
later hinted: “My studies, which were supposed to be traditional, rebelled
against tradition and all familiar things.”[26] Fadlallah
arrived in Beirut in 1966, at a time when the city often mistook itself
for an <i>arrondissement</i> of Paris. In this marketplace of ideologies,
Fadlallah learned to package Islam in a highly competitive way. He, too,
produced a nuanced argument for borrowing from the West while battling
it. In the course of the 1980s Fadlallah became the oracle and mentor of
Hizbullah, preaching dialogue and resistance in the same breath.
<p>Turabi, Ghannushi, and Fadlallah
did not rewrite the idea of the Islamic state developed by Mawdudi, Qutb,
and Khomeini. They repackaged it. They understood that the young doubted
whether the secular West really intended a crusade against Islam, and so
they played down the themes of “Crusaderism” and the “Great Satan,” substituting
the more fashionable rhetoric of Third World anti-imperialism. This came
naturally, for they had overheard the West incriminate itself during their
own sojourns in and near its privileged academe. Their arguments for the
inevitable triumph of Islam drew upon the dark prophecies of the West’s
decline that have emanated from European and American philosophers for
a century. At the same time, they understood that many of the young had
been influenced by notions of class struggle. This they incorporated by
developing a terminology that referred to Muslims as the “dispossessed”
of “the South.”[27] Not surprisingly, fundamentalists
even managed to find apologists among the West’s own Third Worldists, who
thought they heard an echo in the words pumped from Islamist pulpits. (“Because
they hate us, they must be right,” wrote a French writer in irony. “What
a wonderful coincidence that the revelation of truth coincided with anti-imperialist
struggle!”)[28]
<p>The genius of the new thinkers, though,
was to create a climate that could sustain an altogether different analogy.
They understood that many of the young had a sneaking or grudging admiration
for the science and democracy of the liberal West. Thus, they claimed that
elements of both could be selectively borrowed if this served to strengthen
Islam. Without sacrificing any element of ideological principle, they worked
to present Islamic fundamentalist movements as the functional equivalent
of the “reform” movements of the former communist bloc.
<p>This latest repackaging not only
has brought new adherents to fundamentalist movements, but has persuaded
a surprising number of the West’s most hopeful observers of the Middle
East that “Islam is the solution.” They now argue that beneath a monolithic
fa&ccedil;ade, Islamism has grown diverse, and carries the seed of the
long-awaited reform of Islam. “Islam is now at a pivotal and profound moment
of evolution,” announces a journalist, “a juncture increasingly equated
with the Protestant Reformation.”[29] “This is, indeed,
the most exciting period in Islamic religious history since the twelfth
century,” gushes a professor.[30]
<p>But who are the “reformers” who supposedly
are making the first breakthrough in seven centuries? Where are the pathfinding
texts without which a “Reformation” is impossible? As one Western critic
of Islamist thought observes, since the writings of the founders, compiled
well before Iran’s revolution, “there are nothing but brochures, prayers,
feeble glosses and citations of canonical authors.”[31]
In works written a generation ago or more, Fundamentalist Islam became
a coherent ideology, resting on a fixed canon. The road to redemption leads
through the Islamic state of the kind envisioned by Mawdudi, Qutb, and
Khomeini. Turabi speaks for nearly all fundamentalists when he dismisses
the need for any further thought: “Those Muslims who venture to reform
Islam because they are impressed by the Western Reformation. . . did write
a few books, but they did not go very far. They did not impress any Muslim.”[32]
For Turabi’s generation, the intellectual work of thinking through an Islamic
state has already been done. It is now a matter of repackaging the vision
and mobilizing Muslims for its implementation. Turabi himself puts it best:
Islamist movements are today “without elitism or obsession with quality.”
They represent “quantity and the people.”[33]
<p>So far, there has been no “reform,”
and certainly no “Reformation.” While fundamentalist ideology has been
refashioned at its edges, its core remains consistent and stable. A decade
ago, Hasan Hanafi, another Sorbonne-schooled Islamist, described this irreducible
and unalterable core:
<dir>
<dir>In the past, Islam found its way
between two falling empires, the Persian and the Roman. Both were exhausted
by wars. Both suffered moral and spiritual crises. Islam, as a new world
order, was able to expand as a substitute to the old regime. Nowadays,
Islam finds itself again as a new power, marking its way between the two
superpowers in crisis. Islam is regenerating, the two superpowers are degenerating.
Islam is the power of the future, inheriting the two superpowers in the
present.[34]</dir>
</dir>
A decade later, the Soviet Union is
gone and the fundamentalists of Islam claim they pose the last ideological
challenge to the last superpower. Ahmad Khomeini, son of the man who detonated
the first explosion, summarized the fundamentalist point of view: “After
the fall of Marxism, Islam replaced it, and as long as Islam exists, U.S.
hostility exists, and as long as U.S. hostility exists, the struggle exists.”[35]
This Islam, forged by a century of thought, claims the status of a world
ideology. For fundame, the proof of its validity will not be found in the
number of souls it wins but in its empowerment of Islam.
<br><i></i>&nbsp;
<p><br>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Purge Before Power</font></b></center>

<p>To achieve that, of course, Islamism
must first come to state power. Given the strength of existing regimes,
its leaders must build coalitions with other groups if they are to stand
any chance of breaking out of encirclement. And it is here that Islamism
seems to be failing. The Islamic revival was perhaps most flexible at its
outset, in the preaching of Afghani. He altered his message to accommodate
a wide range of political alliances, and his biographer has rightly described
his interpretation of Islam as “more <strike>‘</strike>`progressive’ than
that of the modern revivalists—more open to new ideas and not concerned
with reinforcing the Islam of the past.”[36] Guile
can sometimes compensate for a lack of flexibility: Khomeini’s interpretation
of Islam was not “progressive,” but he struck just such a posture before
the revolution, allowing him to forge a coalition of diverse forces. Because
the shah’s state collapsed so fast, that coalition swept him to power before
it unwound in recriminations and purges. A capacity for dissimulation,
such as that so effectively cultivated in Shi`i Islam, is an immense asset
in the art of politics, and goes far to explain how leaders like Afghani
and Khomeini found crucial allies.
<p>In contrast, today’s Islamists, certainly
in the Arab world, are unwilling to suspend enough of their belief to find
a common ground with potential partners. Their words and deeds frighten
many Muslims, even those who long for change. The reason is violence—not
against the West, but against other Muslims. Even in opposition, Islamist
movements cannot resist the temptation to intimidate opponents, rivals,
and even lukewarm supporters. The kind of purge Khomeini carried out once
in power is being attempted by Islamist movements today, when it only serves
to isolate them. Sayyid Qutb’s idea of an unbelieving society, the basis
of Islamism as ideology, is the congenital defect of Islamism as politics.
Its deleterious effects can be seen in the continuing bloodshed between
Islamic movements in Afghanistan, in the murder of intellectuals in Egypt,
in the indiscriminate bombings against civilians in Algeria. Islamists
claim they have been forced to follow the methods of the regimes they oppose,
but if this is so, why should anyone prefer them? Regimes invoke the threat
of Islamist “terror” precisely because there is a genuine dread of it in
society at large. As a result, the Islamists have no allies, and without
allies their chances of assuming power are slim.
<p><b>Dissimulation</b>
<p>There are some Islamists who know
this, and who are trying (late in the day) to borrow a page from Khomeini’s
techniques of dissimulation. But for dissimulation to succeed, it must
be consistent and seamless. As it is now practiced by many Islamists, dissimulation
is no more than telling each audience whatever it prefers to hear. It is
not too difficult to assemble these utterances and demonstrate their incompatibility.
This is why Turabi, Fadlallah, and Ghannushi, despite protestations of
pluralism, create deep unease among liberals, leftists, nationalists, and
feminists, who might have been allies. They overhear the full discourse
on the Islamic state—a discourse in which one can hear democracy, free
expression, and equal rights denounced as Western cultural imperialism.
<p>Turabi is the only leading Islamist
whose alliance-building has given him some access to power in Sudan, but
his friends are generals and colonels. In the absence of other allies,
the temptation of befriending the military may also prove irresistible
to other fundamentalist movements. If so, Islamism will then have filled
not only the same political space as Arabism. It will have made the same
fatal choice. At some point, it dawned on the military partners of the
Arab nationalist ideologues that they could do without the guidance of
a Sati` al-Husri or a Michel Aflaq. They could formulate ideology for themselves,
whenever needed. Likewise, generals and colonels who take leading Islamists
as guides are likely to discard them, even as they appropriate their ideas
and language. Perhaps this will be the next phase of Islamism, as men of
theory are thrust aside by new military potentates, hungry for Islamic
legitimacy. Libya’s Mu’ammar al-Qadhdhafi is perhaps the transitional man
in this gradual shift from Arab to Islamist military rule.
<p>But this is only speculation, and
it is impossible to predict the future fortunes of Islamism. Of its many
outcomes, only one seems absolutely certain. Like Arabism, Islamism may
fail; and like Arabism, Islamism may fail at great cost, its adherents
gradually becoming its victims. But by then, it will have launched a hundred
careers and a thousand books. Of Marxism, it has been said that it failed
materially everywhere but in Western academe, where its professors turned
it into tenure and grants. Islamism seems destined to do the same.
