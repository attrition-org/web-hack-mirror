<p><center><h2>The IDF’s Technological War against Hizballah Through the Eyes of the Lebanese Media</h2></center>

<p><p>Toward the middle of 1998 the Lebanese media began disseminating articles
to the effect that the IDF has introduced a variety of innovative
methods to improve its intelligence capabilities vis-a-vis Hizballah and
its activists. These new methods have the goal of improving the IDF’s operational
capabilities and adapting them to the conditions of guerilla warfare prevalent
in Lebanon. Reportedly new technological means have been deployed by air,
sea and land, whose object is to constrain the activity of Hizballah in
its attempt to carry out attacks against IDF personnel in Lebanon.
<p>Starting in August ’98 the Lebanese media reported the establishment
of radar installations at several IDF positions around Lebanon:
<p>Alahmadiyya (Radio Nur, 10.1.99); Jezin (<i>Alwatan al-Arabi</i>,
1.1.99); Dabashah (Al Manar Telivision 29.10.98); Sujhud (Radio
Nur, 31.10.98); Riha’an (Radio Nur 3.11.98); Suweidiyyah and Qala’at Shaqif
(Radio Beirut 29.10.98).
<p>According to these sources, the goals of the radar installations are
varied:
<ol>
<li>
“Detection of unmanned gliders by means of ultraviolet radiation” (<i>Alwatan
al-Arabi </i>1.1.99).</li>

<li>
Detection of personnel movements by means of thermal radiation (<i>Alhayyat</i>
16.12.98; <i>As-Safir</i> 20.11.98).</li>

<li>
Jamming of Hizballah’s electronics (<i>Alhayyat</i> 16.12.98)</li>
</ol>
In addition to these innovations, it was reported that the IDF has deployed
sophisticated video cameras around its positions and at the transit points
that Hizballah units must pass in order to execute an attack. These cameras
are allegedly operative 24 hours a day and their images are sent to the
position’s headquarters (Radio Beirut 17.12.98; <i>As-Safir</i> 17.12.98).
<p>Another new tool, which so far has apparently never been seen, is the
hot-air balloon. These are reported to carry surveillance apparatus and
sophisticated cameras intended to backup reconnaissance of problematic
areas and to cover areas deeper into Lebanese territory than can be seen
from the IDF positions. Thus the newspaper <i>An Nahar</i> reported (8.1.99)
that “people returning from the border areas said that the Israelis have
once more deployed a hot-air surveillance balloon in the region of the
border village of Remiyya.” According to the newspaper report, the balloon
was about the size of a helicopter.
<p>The same paper also reported (2.11.98) that “the Israelis deployed a
hot-air balloon on the slopes of Jabel-e-Sheikh (the Hermon) in the framework
of their reconnaissance of Hizballah movements in the area.”
<p>These balloons or others like them were also deployed by the Israelis
in the western region, according to “The Voice of the People” radio. (13.1.99)
<p>On the naval front, the French press reported from Tyre (11.1.99) that
a Lebanese fisherman named Racha reported that “Israel has set up for the
first time radar systems inside south Lebanese territorial waters, restricting
the movements of fishermen . . .. The fisherman saw the antenna at a distance
of 4 km from Jamal Nakura. He said that here were many parabolic antennas
mounted on buoys or set up together with a TV monitor.”
<p>“The Voice of the People” also reported (13.1.99) “antennas set up by
the Israeli forces on military vessels patrolling the beaches of south
Lebanon and in the vicinity of the of Beit Yahun in the central region,”
whose purpose is to observe the movements of resistance fighters.
<p>However it would seem that the most interesting technique employed by
Israel in Lebanon, according to the same sources is domesticated animals.
The most familiar animal in Lebanon, as in the rest of the world, is the
dog, whose value to military units lies in his ability to sniff out explosives.
(<i>Aldiyar</i>, 29.08.98) The IDF reportedly trains dogs for such missions,
as well as for accompanying foot patrols, and attacking Hizballah personnel
(<i>Al-Ittihad</i>, 20.12.98).
<p>The Lebanese paper <i>Albilad</i> (29.08.98) maintains that “The occupation
forces have recently started using wild pigs, to track resistance fighters.
The Israelis attach electronic instruments to collars on the wild pigs,
so that as the pigs roam the streambeds between occupied territory and
liberated territory, the movements of personnel can be tracked. These instruments
send an electronic signal to a combined command center, from which it is
sent out to forward positions and military command centers . . .. The use
of wild pigs derives from the fact that they frequent inaccessible places,
and from the fact that a wild pig, upon seeing a human, makes a particular
noise. Residents of the Jenin area claimed to have hunted wild pigs fitted
with Israeli electronic instruments.”
<p>Hizballah, for its part maintains that in spite of all these innovations,
it continues to score victories against the IDF, thus proving its techno-operative
superiority over the IDF. However, intelligence sources maintain that such
statements are merely a tool in the psychological war waged by Hizballah
against the IDF. In reality the organization is finding it more difficult
than ever to operate without discovery by the network of surveillance set
up by the IDF in southern Lebanon.
<p>Evidence to this effect was given in an interview with Mohammed Raed,
a member of Hizballah’s “Shurah” Council published in the newspaper <i>Al-lua’ah</i>
(30.08.98): “The enemy has recently implemented sophisticated technological
methods, which severely disrupted the activities of the resistance . .
..”
