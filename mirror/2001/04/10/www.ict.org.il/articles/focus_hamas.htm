<center><b><font size=+2>Focus on Hamas: The PLO’s Friend or Foe?</font></b></center>

<p><b><a href="#author">Morton A. Klein</a></b>
<p><i>This article was first published by <a href="http://www.allenpress.com/mieq/" target="_blank">Middle East Quarterly</a> in June
1996</i>
<p>From Israel’s point of view, perhaps the single most important benefit
of the Oslo accords was the pledge by Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) chairman Yasir Arafat to prevent Arab terrorist attacks. As then-foreign
minister Shimon Peres put it, “Why should we chase the Hamas when the PLO
can do it for us?”[1]
<p>The May 1994 agreement that spells out the terms of PLO control over
the Gaza Strip and the city of Jericho explicitly required it to “take
all measures necessary to prevent” terrorists operating on its territory
from attacking Israelis.[2] The Oslo II accords of September 1995, which
gave the PLO and its governing arm, the Palestinian Authority (PA), control
over seven major cities in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), reaffirmed
that obligation: “The Palestinian Police will act systematically against
all expressions of violence and terror.”[3]
<p>Nearly three years have passed since the first Israeli agreement was
reached with the PLO, time enough for a record to be established. Has the
PLO in fact maintained its part of the bargain? If not, what does this
imply for the peace process?
<p>This analysis examines the PLO’s relations with the terrorist groups
during three periods: the nineteen months following the White House handshake
(September 1993 to April 1995); the first so-called crackdown by the PLO
against terrorist groups (April 1995 to February 1996); and the second
so-called crackdown (beginning in March 1996).
<p><b>September 1993 to April 1995</b>
<br>Israelis did not assume the PLO and PA would prevent every single terrorist
attack, but they did expect Arafat and the PLO-PA[4] to do their very best,
which, according to the agreements, meant disarming terrorists and honoring
any requests Israel would make for extraditing terrorists.[5] It also meant
the PLO-PA would regard Hamas and Islamic Jihad as its enemy and would
do everything possible to stamp out those groups.
<p>In fact, the PLO has made great efforts to maintain friendly relations
with Hamas throughout the almost three years since the White House handshake.
<blockquote>The PLO has made great efforts to maintain friendly relations

During the first nineteen months following the White House signing, the
PLO did not even pretend to be taking action against the terrorists. Indeed,
Arafat openly said “that he will not disarm Hamas,” Reuters reported.[6]
Initially, the PLO claimed it could not take any real anti-terrorist measures
until it actually controlled some territory. Yet, the PLO’s takeover of
Gaza and Jericho in May 1994 did not stop terrorist attacks. From the beginning
of Gaza-Jericho self-rule until the April 1995 “crackdown,” 172 terrorist
attacks took place, in which 78 Israelis were killed and 230 wounded, and
21 Arabs were killed and 16 wounded.[7] The great majority, but not all,
of these attacks were undertaken by fundamentalist Islamic groups; twenty
of them were carried out by factions of the PLO.[8]
<p>According to Israeli military officers, members of Fatah placed themselves
under Hamas command shortly after that ceremony, and continued to engage
in terrorism under the cover of Hamas.[9] The PLO police even hired Hamas
members, including ninety individuals who staffed the new “vice department”--evidently
a euphemism for the PLO death squads that murdered over one thousand Palestinian
Arabs during the intifada years on suspicion of committing “acts of immorality.”[10]
And in local elections in Hebron, Fatah ran together with Hamas on a joint
list, the “Palestinian Martyrs Bloc.”[11]
<p>By early 1994, investigative journalists for the Washington Jewish Week
found that the PLO had “quietly built up a working relationship” of “close
coordination” with Hamas.[12] Sheikh Ahmad Yasin, the quadriplegic, imprisoned
Hamas leader, announced his support for “Arafat’s steps to recover part
of Palestine.”[13] In return, Arafat pressured Israel to release Yasin,
whom he called “my brother Ahmed Yasin the warrior,” and all other Hamas
members, from prison.[14] Formalizing this bond, the PLO and Hamas signed
a “Document of Honor” in late 1993, pledging an end to violence between
them.
<p>When asked about this PLO-Hamas collaboration, the first counselor to
the PLO Mission to the United Nations, Muin Shreim, explained: “Our tactics
vary; our schedule might vary. We believe the agreement [with Israel] is
the first step toward a Palestinian state. We vary in how many steps.”
Shreim confirmed that as a result of the accord with Hamas, “there is a
local cooperation between Fatah and Hamas.”[15] PLO minister of planning
Nabil Sha`th declared that the PLO has “a brotherly relationship with Hamas.”[16]
The PLO’s “foreign minister,” Faruq Qaddumi, said that “no one can complain
about what Hamas and Jihad are doing. I say it is the right of every Palestinian
to struggle so long as there is a single Israeli soldier in the land of
Palestine.”[17]
<p><b>April 1995 to February 1996</b>
<br>In response to a particularly horrifying attack on April 9, 1995 --
in which nine people were killed, including a Brandeis University student
from New Jersey, Alisa Flatow -- the Israeli and U.S. governments demanded
a PLO crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The PLO dutifully promised
compliance. But when it came to disarming the terrorists, prosecuting them,
extraditing them to Israel, or even renouncing them verbally, the PLO failed
to live up to its promises.
<blockquote>When it came to disarming the terrorists, prosecuting them,

<i>Disarming terrorists.</i> The PLO-PA announced on April 11, 1995, that
all individuals in Gaza and Jericho possessing weapons had to surrender
them by May 11 “and if they do not do so, the weapons will be confiscated.”[18]
But as The New York Times reported in late May, “the deadline came and
went without any visible response by the Palestinian security forces. There
have been no sweeps of neighborhoods to find unlicensed weapons or to disarm
Muslim militants, and Palestinians who missed the deadline for licensing
their guns have not been punished.” The PLO-PA’s police commander, Nasir
Yusuf, said such steps had not been taken because Arafat had not yet given
the order to do so.[19] Hamas training camps also continued to operate
in the Gaza Strip, according to information gleaned from Hamas members
captured by Israeli forces in early June 1995.[20] When Youssef M. Ibrahim
of The New York Times visited Gaza in July, the only evidence he could
find of PLO-PA action was the detention of a handful of Hamas members;
and in one case, he reported, PLO-PA police interrogators forcibly shaved
the hair of a Hamas detainee.[21]
<p><i>Prosecuting terrorists. </i>When Jerusalem and Washington also made
clear in April their insistence that the PLO-PA formally prosecute Hamas
and Islamic Jihad members for attacks on Israelis, the PLO-PA began conducting
quick, middle-of-the-night trials; between April 10 and July 10, twenty-three
such trials took place, eight of them in the period April 9-19, when publicity
was focused most intensely on the PLO’s actions. Once the limelight shifted,
the frequency of the trials dropped drastically.
<p>Significantly, none of the defendants was accused of the murder of Israelis.
Rather, they were charged with (in the words of PA spokesmen) such crimes
as “conspiracies to affect the general security” and “weapons training
without a license.” The sentences were commensurately light: in a case
in which the two defendants were reportedly involved in murdering an Israeli,
they were convicted only of unauthorized weapons training and sent to jail
for two years.[22] Not only did this minor punishment make light of the
killing of Jews but it negated the deterrent effect of a serious sentence.
In effect, the PLO-PA signaled that attacks on Israelis would not be punished.
<p><i>Extraditing terrorists.</i> In all, the Israeli authorities during
this period requested that eindividuals be extradited but the PLO-PA at
all trefused to honor its obligation to hand over terrorists.[23] Toadd
insult to injury, one of those eleven, Yasir Abu Samhadana, was hired by
the PLO-PA police as its senior commander for the Khan Yunis area of Gaza.[24]
<p><i>Condemning terrorists. </i>Although Arafat did condemn terrorism
in the abstract, he refused to mention Hamas or Islamic Jihad by name.
Quite the reverse, he dismissed Hamas’s responsibility and instead blamed
Israelis for the death of their own people. Speaking to a delegation headed
by Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, Arafat made the bizarre and insulting
accusation that Israeli nationalists carried out recent terrorist attacks
“to help kill the peace process,”[25] then the following month Arafat repeated
this allegation to a Peace Now delegation.[26] The bombing of a Jerusalem
bus in August 1995 prompted a similar analysis by Arafat: the attack, he
said, resulted from “cooperation between fanatics on both sides.”[27]
<p>In short, the PLO’s April 1995 “crackdown” never took place. To the
extent that terrorist attacks decreased after April 1995, this resulted
not from actions taken by Arafat but from the Israeli security services’
capture of more would-be terrorists. In June, the commander of an Israeli
army brigade in the Gaza Strip revealed that “the main reason” for the
decrease was “the intensive activities” of Israeli forces, including the
arrest of more than seventy Hamas activists who were planning car bombings,
kidnappings, and hijackings.[28] In August, officials of the General Security
Services (Shin Bet) said they had foiled an additional forty-eight attacks,
including ten planned kidnappings, but again reported that their success
“was due not to cooperation from the Palestinian Authority but rather the
use of interrogation techniques which have been allowed under special temporary
permission.”[29]
<p><b>“A Brotherly Relationship”</b>
<br>The PLO-Hamas partnership continued after April 1995. `Abbas Zaki,
a member of the Central Committee of Fatah, said that Hamas’s attacks “strengthen
the Palestinian position. . . . It would be dangerous to stop these actions,
because the accords will crumble if there is nothing to make Israel go
forward.”[30] The PLO-PA’s Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein, declared
that “the PLO and the [Hamas] opposition complement each other. . . . We
regard Hamas and Islamic Jihad as national elements. . . . The main enemy,
now and forever, is Israel.”[31] Hanan Ashrawi, a PLO activist, declared
that “it is not up to Israel to decide or define who is our enemy. Hamas
is not the enemy, it is part of the political fabric.”[32]
<p>When Musa Abu Marzuq, a top Hamas leader, was detained at Kennedy airport
in July 1995, Arafat’s spokesman called him “Brother Abu Marzuq” and condemned
Israel for requesting his extradition.[33] Arafat then offered Abu Marzuq
haven in Gaza.[34] Interestingly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation found
on the person of Abu Marzuq’s wife an address book that contained six private
phone numbers for Arafat, including those of his cellular phone and his
car phone.[35] Abu Marzuq’s attorney subsequently announced Arafat’s agreement
to testify on behalf of Marzuq at his forthcoming trial,[36] and Ashrawi
declared her willingness to submit an affidavit for his extradition hearing.[37]
<p>Hoping that an Israeli withdrawal from Arab-populated areas would persuade
the Arabs to reduce or halt terrorism -- or at least persuade the PLO-PA
to take steps against the terrorists -- Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed
the Oslo II accords on September 28, 1995, in which he agreed to an Israeli
withdrawal from seven cities in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) in November-December
1995.
<p>Contrary to Rabin’s hope, terrorism against Israelis worsened after
Oslo II. In the half year after its signing, 136 terrorist attacks took
place (leading to 65 Israeli deaths and 344 wounded, plus 6 Arabs killed
and 4 wounded). By contrast, the half year prior to Oslo II saw only 73
attacks (killing 21 Israelis and wounding 185, plus 1 Arab killed and 1
wounded). The number of attacks, in other words, increased nearly 100 percent,
Israeli deaths from terrorism increased more than 300 percent, and the
number of wounded almost doubled.
<p>On December 22, 1995, soon after the PLO took over the West Bank cities,
it signed an agreement to define relations with Hamas in the PLO-controlled
territories. According to the terms of the deal, which Arafat praised as
“good” and “nice,” Hamas would hold off suicide bombings until after the
Palestinian Arab elections on January 20, 1996. After that date, Hamas
would be free to resume attacks against Israelis anywhere in Israel or
in Israeli-administered territory.[38] Salim Za`nun, head of the PLO-PA
negotiating team, explained the agreement:
<blockquote>We are not the defenders of the Israeli entity. We see it as
sufficient to obligate Hamas not to embarrass the Palestinian Authority,
which is responsible for security in the areas it has received. . . . If
Israel wants to spare itself Hamas attacks, it had better hurry and withdraw
from the rest of the territories.[39]</blockquote>
When the master Hamas bomb-maker Yahya `Ayyash (responsible for killing
at least 70 Israelis and wounding 350) was assassinated by an exploding
cellular telephone in January 1996, Arafat responded by praising him as
a “martyr” and a “hero of the Palestinian people.” The PLO-PA gave `Ayyash
a funeral with full honors and a twenty-one-gun salute, while Arafat paid
a personal condolence call on the Hamas leadership.[40] It later came out
that Arafat’s representatives had previously offered `Ayyash “safe passage”
across the Gaza-Egypt border.[41] On February 10, 1996 -- just two weeks
before the recent suicide bombings began -- thousands of residents in PLO-controlled
Nablus held a memorial rally for `Ayyash; at it, the organizers presented
a young, masked man whom they introduced as “the next suicide bomber.”
All this took place, Israel Television reported, “with the approval and
under the vigilant eye of the Palestinian police.”[42] Then, just twenty-four
hours before the suicide attacks began, Arafat reportedly met with Muhammad
Dayf, Hamas’s outstanding organizer of terror, and offered Hamas seats
in his cabinet.[43]
<p><b>Since March 1996</b>
<br>Sure enough, soon after the Palestinian Arab elections took place,
Hamas struck. A series of five devastating assaults took place during eight
days at the end of February 1996: two suicide bus-bombings in Jerusalem,
a bomb at a shopping mall in Tel Aviv, one at a bus station in Ashkelon,
and an incident where a terrorist rammed his car into a Jerusalem bus stop.
The carnage left 59 people dead and over 200 wounded.
<p>This time, it was said, Arafat would really crack down on Hamas. The
New York Times reported that “until the latest attacks, Mr. Arafat had
resisted Israel’s calls for a real crackdown on Hamas.” So, after the new
bombings, “Israel and the United States put heavy pressure on Mr. Arafat
to go after the militants,” and Arafat responded by declaring “that he
was ready to take on unsanctioned armed groups.”[44] But would the PLO
this time really live up to its promises?
<p><i>Disarming terrorists. </i>Arafat announced in early March 1996 that
his forces would seize all illegal weapons held in PLO-controlled territory.
But then he appeared to hedge. Asked about disarming Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, Arafat took refuge in a conspiracy theory: “We must remember that
these organizations were created by Israel, which also distributed arms
to them, so are we supposed to collect the arms Israel distributed?”[45]
Asked at a House International Relations Committee hearing on March 12,
1996, why the PLO-PA was not undertaking a house-to-house search for illegal
weapons, the PLO’s representative in the United States, Hasan `Abd ar-Rahman,
replied: “We don’t wish to harm anyone’s civil rights. We have a democracy.”
<p>At a press conference on March 6, the PLO-PA police displayed 45 pistols
and 53 rifles which they claimed to have seized from Hamas members.[46]
But the PLO-PA’s claim that it was making a serious effort to disarm terrorists
was challenged by AmiHess, Gaza correspondent for the left-wing Israeli
daily Ha’aretz: “All of the action is for the television cameras,” Hess
said. “It is a fantasy like the Tales of the Arabian Nights. No serious
quantity of seized guns has been shown and if they did show some I would
not be surprised if they took them from the police armory.”[47] In any
event, the handful of pistols and rifles exhibited at the press conference
paled in comparison with the 26,000 illegal weapons in the possession of
Gaza residents alone--the estimate made by Arafat himself.[48]
<p><i>Prosecuting terrorists.</i>The string of four bombings prompted the
PLO-PA to detain several hundred Hamas and Islamic Jihad members.[49] Most
detainees, a leftist Israeli newspaper reported, were “the social and political
activists of Hamas, who are not viewed by the Israeli security services
as a real danger. . . . Arafat has refrained thus far from a real confrontation
with the members of the military wing of Hamas.”[50] “Until now the PLO
police have not arrested the heads of the terror organizations in Gaza,”
said Yitzhak Eitan, commander of the Israeli army’s Gaza Brigade. “The
wanted Hamas leaders are walking free. The Palestinian Authority only arrested
`small fry’ . . . the heads of the attackers are walking free in Gaza,
and the Palestinian police are arresting people who are not connected to
the military arm and the attacks.”[51] Asked if the PLO-PA had done enough
to fight the terrorists, the officer responsible for security in the administered
territories (i.e., the West Bank) replied: “The answer is no.”[52]
<p>Likewise, Israeli security officials said that “Mr. Arafat, for all
of his previous assurances to Israel that he would crack down on Hamas,
has not done so in any meaningful way. . . . By contrast, Mr. Arafat’s
security services have energetically, efficiently and ruthlessly hunted
down and killed many suspected Israeli informants.”[53] PLO-PA officials
dismissed Israel’s request for the arrest of top Hamas leaders as “interference
in Palestinian affairs.”[54]
<p>Of those who were detained, only one, Muhammad Abu Warda, was prosecuted.
His middle-of-the-night trial on March 5 “was held so quickly,” The Jerusalem
Post reported, “that it appeared designed to head off an inevitable Israeli
request for his extradition,” since a loophole in the Oslo accords permits
the PLO to delay extraditing an individual so long as the person is in
a PLO prison.[55] What sort of justice other Hamas members might receive
remains to be seen: two judges appointed to handle security-related cases
in a new PLO-PA military court in Kalkilya are former PLO policemen who,
just days before the February 1996 bombings, were present at a rally in
Kalkilya where Hamas supporters burned an effigy of an Israeli bus labeled
“Dizengoff No. 5” to the cheers of a mob.[56]
<p><i>Extraditing terrorists.</i> Israel had by late March requested the
extradition of twenty-one terrorists. But the PLO-PA made it clear that
it would not oblige. A senior PA police official declared that “the Palestinian
Authority will never extradite any of the Hamas or Islamic Jihad detainees
to Israel.”[57] To make matters worse, PLO officials urged Muhammad Diaf
and other Hamas leaders to take temporary refuge in the Sudan “so as to
avoid being arrested or harmed by Israel.” The aim of the offer, according
to The Jerusalem Report, was “to get [Arafat] off the hook when Israel
pressed him to root out the militants.”[58]
<p><i>Condemning terrorists.</i> At the height of the February bombings,
Arafat never condemned Hamas or Islamic Jihad by name.[59] After the first
Jerusalem bus bombing, on February 25, it took the PLO-PA more than six
hours to release a statement, which blamed the terrorism on Israel for
refusing to release all imprisoned terrorists.[60] Abu Medein declared
that Israel could stop such violence by setting free 2,500 Hamas terrorists
held in Israeli prisons.[61]
<p>Indeed, far from blaming and condemning Hamas, Arafat absolved Hamas
of responsibility for the bombings. During the wave of suicide bombings
in February 1996, he claimed that a group of former Israeli soldiers known
as “OAS” had provided the bombs to the terrorists; and that Israel’s Foreign
Minister Ehud Barak had previously secretly served as the head of “OAS.”[62]
<p>Nor has Arafat outlawed Hamas or Islamic Jihad; as of mid-March, Ehud
Ya’ari, the Arab affairs correspondent for Israel Television, wrote that
“there has been no official sign to date” to indicate that he had done
so.[63] Quite the contrary, Ze’ev Schiff, Israel’s most respected security-affairs
reporter, writes that one of the PLO’s senior negotiators with Hamas, Muhammad
Dahlan (formerly an architect of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the
1972 Munich Olympics, now the PLO’s preventive security chief in Gaza),
knew in advance of Hamas’s intention to carry out a “major attack” against
Israel:
<blockquote>He neither arrested the Hamas “military wing” leaders nor tried
to talk them out of perpetrating the atrocity. All he asked was that they
postpone it until after the Israeli elections [on May 29, 1996]. Even after
the first bus bombing in Jerusalem on February 25, Dahlan did not arrest
those responsible for masterminding the bombing, but continued negotiating
with the Hamas terrorists, including Muhammad Diaf, who heads Israel’s
wanted list.[64]</blockquote>
Arafat himself maintained contact with Hamas at the height of the bombing
wave in February, as shown by the fact that he personally sent Prime Minister
Shimon Peres a proposal from Hamas temporarily to halt the bombings in
exchange for an end to Israel’s search for the bombers.[65]
<p>After the recent wave of Hamas terrorist suicide bombings, and after
Arafat solemnly proclaimed his intent to combat Hamas, Faruq Qaddumi, the
PLO’s number-two figure, declared that “Hamas is part of the national movement
and it has its own style and approach to action. It is resisting the Israeli
enemy.”[66]
<p><b>The Danger Israel Faces</b>
<br>Israel now faces a situation in which the PLO-PA treats Hamas as an
ally, not an enemy. Arafat’s police have seized only a token number of
weapons, have detained a few low-level Hamas members but did not prosecute
them, and have left Hamas’s training camps and infrastructure intact. IN
many ways, Hamas and the PLO behave like allies, not enemies.
<p>The Hamas response to these PLO-PA actions points to its acceptance
of Arafat’s moves as a carefully calibrated slap on the wrist. As Ehud
Barak, now Israel’s foreign minister, once put it, “The PLO and Hamas are
two faces of the national movement, with very similar long-term goals in
all that regards Israel.”[67] Note, for example, that Hamas has never tried
to assassinate Arafat or other PLO-PA officials; nor has it tried to blame
its terrorism on the PLO. Quite the contrary, by claiming responsibility
for attacks in its own name, Hamas makes the PLO look moderate in comparison,
thereby helping Arafat. Along these lines, Israel Television correspondent
Ehud Ya’ari has observed that “none of Hamas’s leaflets or underground
writings ever say that Hamas is interested in stopping the peace process.”[68]
<p>Hamas uses terrorism not to end the peace process but to speed it up,
a point that PLO-PA leaders sometimes acknowledge. Addressing a pro-Hamas
audience, the head of the PA’s Israel Desk remarked that “the attacks push
Israel and, in effect, assist us in implementing the process.”[69] On the
occasion of the PLO’s takeover of the city of Jenin in November 1995, Arafat
praised it as the “city of `Izz ad-Din Qassam”--the terrorist after whom
the Hamas military wing is named.[70] Hamas leaders have reciprocated by
not attacking Arafat. Note that `Imad Faluji, a senior Hamas activist,
did not denounce Arafat’s plans for the elected Palestinian Council: “This
is good, but it is not enough,” he said.[71]
<p>When the Israeli army controlled the West Bank and Gaza territories,
it could gather intelligence to prevent terror attacks and break up terrorist
cells. With thePA now in charge of much of the territories, however, Hamas
can retain its infrastructure of hideouts, weapons depots, trainincamps,
and the like. The New York Times reported on March 3 that “Arafat made
clear his not about to go after what Mr. Peres called the Hamas ‘infrastructure.’”
Likewise, Gen. Yaakov Amidror, chief of Israeli Military Intelligence,
told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee more than two weeks
after the suicide bombings that Arafat “has done a minimal amount to fight
Hamas terrorism, despite the serious situation” and “has failed to do anything
to destroy the Hamas infrastructure.”[72] Thanks to the quiet collaboration
of the PLO, Hamas cells are flourishing, weapons and explosives have come
pouring in, terrorists are given safe haven, and Israel is no longer able
to gather intelligence.[73]
<blockquote>With the PA now in charge of much of the territories, Hamas
can retain its infrastructure of hideouts, weapons depots, training camps,
and the like.</blockquote>
“Hamas is not seeking to block [Oslo II],” Ya’ari wrote recently. “The
leadership of the Islamic movement has no desire to prevent the Israeli
army’s withdrawal from Palestinian population centers. . . . Hamas believes
it will be able to set up new terror arms in West Bank cities. . . . Hamas
doesn’t want to stop the peace process--it just wants to empty it of the
elements of cease-fire.”[74] Thanks to the quiet collaboration of the PLO-PA,
Hamas is doing just that.
