<p><img SRC="../graphics/militants_w.gif" height=174 width=210 align=RIGHT><b>Preface</b>
<p>This paper deals with the financing of Islamist terrorist groups in
the Middle East. It is these groups that have in the past decade become
the center of terrorist activity in the region and elsewhere in the world.
Furthermore, we can trace in the last two to three years a shift of Islamist
terrorist influence from the Middle East to Central and Southern Asia.
This shift is the result of several main factors. Among these, we can cite
the fall of the Soviet Union; the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan; the Oslo
Accord and the expected process of reconciliation between Israel and the
Palestinians; the rise of national and nationalistic feelings in Southern
Europe and the Balkan; and better cooperation of Middle Eastern countries
in countering terrorism, even between Israeli and Palestinian security
service. All this has caused a re-centering of Islamist terrorist activity
from the heart of the Middle East eastward and toward the Balkans—Bosnia,
Albania, and Kossovo; toward the Caucasus—Chechnya and Dagestan; and lastly
toward Asia—Uzbekistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, and the Philippines. There
is kind of nationalist-Islamist terrorism even in Xinjiang in Western China,
carried out by Uighur nationalists and Islamists.
<p>This shift is part of another process of the globalization of the Islamist
struggle.[1] However, to date, this shift in the focus and axis of Islamist
terrorism has not changed one important fact: the ideologies, cultural
influence and religious justification for this kind of terrorism still
emanate from the Middle East and the Arab World. As long we are facing
Islamist terrorism, the Arab Muslim World remains the source of what we
may call the “Islamist culture of terrorism.” Two of the most prominent
phenomena of the 1990s are ample evidence of this: the phenomenon of the
“Afghan Alumni”/ “Afghan Arabs,” and the spread of Islamist Suicide terrorism
as a religiously legitimate <i>Modus Operandi</i>, from Lebanon and Israel
to Turkey and—this last year—to Chechnya and Kashmir.
<p>This paper does not deal with Islam or Islamic groups in general, or
with the notion of confrontation between Islam and the West. Instead, it
examines the views and perceptions of Islamist terrorist groups towards
Western culture and the way in which these groups present this confrontation
as a <i>clash of civilizations </i>or Islam vs. the West. For this reason,
this paper uses the term “Islamists” or “Islamist terrorist groups.” This
term applies to those Islamic groups that use the radical and militant
interpretation of Islam in order to portray the religious duty of <i>Jihad</i>
as meaning the use of violence and indiscriminate terrorism. These groups
often misinterpret Orthodox Islam and many of their perceptions are in
dispute in the Arab and Muslim world. And yet, they influence many believers
all over the Muslim world as well as Muslim communities in the West. This
influence is the consequence of a combination of political, social, economic
and cultural confrontations under the guise of religious expressions.
<p><b>Introduction</b>
<p>Financing and fund-raising are difficult topics for research when dealing
with organizations in general, to say nothing of clandestine ones.[2]The
tendency of both the individual and community is to keep this issue private,
far from public eyes. Dealing with clandestine groups is naturally much
more difficult, and in the case of Islamist terrorist groups, perhaps the
most difficult of all.[3] These groups are in many cases unique, compared
to other kinds of known terrorist groups, such as nationalists, Marxists,
or Anarchists.
<p>This uniqueness is the consequence of two main factors. One is the Islamic
religious element in which charity is one of the most important duties
and is used as the primary means to disguise financial activity. The other
is the relatively widespread support given to the Islamic movements and
organizations for political, social, or cultural reasons. Above all, there
is the fact that these are religious groups, or at least pass themselves
off as such. This is of great benefit in a society in which Islam is deeply
rooted and highly respected among the vast majority of the Arab and Muslim
World.
<p>This religious element is most important in the case of the financing
of terrorist groups. In recent years there has been a decline in the sponsoring
of terrorism by states, as pointed out in the 1999 report, “Patterns of
Global Terrorism” published annually by the US State Department.[4] What
this means is that <i>public support</i> for terrorist groups has become
the most essential element in fund-raising and the main source of finances.
Indeed, contrary to what many might think, public fund-raising from individuals
is the most important element in the finance of many institutes, associations
and public organizations. This has been shown by researches and surveys
in the U.S. We should therefore focus on this point too with regard to
the finance of terrorist groups in the Middle East.
<p><b>Sources of the Islamist “Terrorist Culture”</b>
<p>The public support for such Islamist terrorist groups, so vital to their
success and their financial prospects, is the consequence of four social
and psychological factors underlying the Islamic social-political renaissance:
<ul>
<li>
Islamic and Islamist movements and groups have succeeded in the past three
decades in fostering in Arab and Muslim societies the notion of a kind
of global cultural war, in which they confront a global conspiracy against
Islam as a religion, culture and way of life. Thus, concepts synonymous
in the Western political culture with terrorism and political violence
are now viewed by many in the Islamic world to be Islamic religious duties.
Such concepts include <i>Jihad, Takfir </i>(refutation), <i>Istishhad</i>
(Martyrdom, including by suicide), and <i>Shahid</i> (Martyr). The central
notion, common to most of the Islamic movements and groups—those that carry
out terrorism and political violence, and those that justify it and feed
the atmosphere that promotes such activity—is that of being in a state
of siege which calls for self defense. To the believers in this concept,
the confrontation justifies the use of all means—particularly when these
means are given religious legitimacy.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Many of the Islamist and Islamic movements and groups have succeeded in
convincing many in the Muslim world that they represent the true contemporary
interpretation of Islam. Moreover, most of these groups developed out of
the perceived need to return to the fundamental sources of Islam. Thus,
they based their views on Islamic scholars like Ibn Hanbal (7<sup>th</sup>
Century), Ibn Taymiyyah (14<sup>th</sup> Century), and Ibn `Abd al-Wahhab
(18<sup>th</sup> Century), who were the leading fundamentalist religious
scholars, as well as the most unyielding in doctrine.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
The success of the Islamist movements lies in the basic diversity of Islam.
However it also owes much, on one hand, to the lack of a single Islamic
center that enjoys the confidence of the vast majority of the Muslim World,
and the control of the modern secular regimes in the Muslim World over
the religious establishments, on the other. Those establishments are viewed
by large parts of the public as civil servants of the secular state, whose
interpretations and rulings conform to the interests of the state. Thus,
Islamic and Islamist groups and individuals have become the spiritual guides
of quite a large population, and maintain a great deal of power and influence.
<p>Most of the Islamic movements and groups, primarily those that emerged
during and after the 1960s, present the Arab and Muslim regimes—and in
some cases rightfully—as symbols of arbitrary oppression and the distortion
of the social justice rooted in Islam. Thus they encourage their followers
to sympathize with and support those who present themselves as the protectors
of the weaker elements of society. In many cases they manage to recruit
to their side elements of social, political and cultural protest against
Arab and Muslim regimes. These elements also see themselves as standing
against the alleged global conspirators: The United States, Israel, the
Jews, Western “Crusader” heretic culture, etc.
<p>At the base of this phenomenon lies the inability of large sections
of Muslim publics to cope with the technological, cultural, or economic
aspects of Western modernization. This has brought about the tendency to
blame the secular cultures that have given rise to these regimes on one
hand, and to find salvation in the return to Islam and its glorious past—a
kind of “Messianism” that gives hope for a better future, on the other.
Since Orthodox Islam is identified with the Islamic establishments of the
modern nationalist secular—sometimes even revolutionary and socialist—states,
the support was given to those who represented the opposite culture: the
activist alternative that stands against the state.
<p>The Islamic social-political revival, particularly since the 1960s,
is linked both to social changes in the Arab and Muslim World, and to the
formation of an educated middle class in different countries. This middle
class has in part distanced itself from the Western secular modernization
and the institutions of the modern state: the military, government, economic
institutions controlled by the state, the public media, etc. Another part
of this class, mainly professionals with respected professions such as
physicians, lawyers, pharmacists, engineers, academic scholars, or merchants
who have suffered from the tendency to nationalize the economy by the state,
have found in the Islam propounded by modern Islamist trends the solution
to their problems. This process created a large and highly educated group
of individuals, who saw themselves as a social <i>Avant-garde</i>, and
who based their struggle on Islamist theories of historical trends.
<p>The next stage was characterized by massive activity within the existing
Islamic groups, along with the formation of new Islamic groups, followed
by the publication of new ideologies that did not necessarily correspond
with Orthodox Islam. Many of these newer ideologies won numerous adherents
in the course of the ensuing violent struggle. Thus there emerged popular
ideologues such as Sayyid Qutb, the engineers Shukri Mustafa and Muhammad
`Abd al-Salam Faraj, and Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri and Dr. Rifa`i Ahmad Taha
in Egypt. In Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, the struggle was championed
by Dr. `Abdallah `Azzam and Osama Bin Ladin. In addition there were the
Palestinian Dr. Fathi Shiqaqi, Omar Muhammad Bakri in London, Dr. Hasan
al-Turabi in the Sudan, the Tunisian Rashid al-Ghanushi now in exile in
London, the Syrian Dr. Issam al-`Attar in Germany, and others.
<p>Alongside these ideologues there emerged individuals of high Islamic
religious education who encouraged the new radical Islamic perceptions
and gave their counterparts religious legitimacy. These included Sheikh
Omar `Abd al-Rahman in Egypt, who is now serving a life sentence in an
American prison, the Egyptian Yousef al-Qardawi now in Qatar, Dr. Yousef
al-`Azm in Jordan, Fathi Yakan and Sa`id Hawwa in Syria and Lebanon, Muhammad
al-Albani in Syria, and the Palestinian As`ad Bayyoud al-Tamimi in Jordan.
<p>All these processes assisted the Islamist groups in gaining more power
and public support, enabling them in some cases to attract elements of
social protest and the struggle for human and civil rights. But, there
is another very important element to note here, mainly in regard to the
issue of the financing of terrorist activities. This is what we may call
“the Islamic atmosphere” created by movements and groups that are not connected
to political violence or terrorism. Some of these movements even publicly
condemn the use of terrorism, or at least express reservation towards it.
Their importance for terrorist financing lies in two linked factors:
<ul>
<li>
These groups and movements carry out the vast majority of political, social,
cultural and educational Islamic work, both in the Muslim world and among
Muslim communities in the West. Therefore, they serve as the most important
element in creating and preserving the “Islamic atmosphere” that is used
by more extremist and violent Islamist groups. They are in many cases a
greenhouse for the emergence of violent groups and the preservation of
worldviews of hostility towards the West or Western culture.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The infrastructure—whether social, political, cultural, educational or
charitable—of these movements is the main venue for the financing of Islamic
projects. As such they can be used also, as by-product, for the financing
of violent and terrorist groups. They are also most active in consolidating
Muslim communities in the West, and therefore are the foundation for massive
fund-raising by militant Islamist groups among these publics.</li>
</ul>
The Islamic societies, whether in the Muslim World or in the West, together
with the “Islamic atmosphere,” even if non-violent, thus play a crucial
role not only in the financing social and cultural activities, but of Islamist
terrorism as well. Social Islamic work is also in many cases part of social
protest, either against secular Muslim regimes or Western societies—a protest
that facilitates the activities of some of the Islamist groups. The Islamist
“Terrorist Culture” can be sketched as a pyramid; at base there is the
large-scale activity of the Islamic social and non-violent groups: associations,
institutes, and projects of all kinds. At the head of the pyramid there
are the terrorist groups. In the middle there are various processes that
refine certain social elements into hatred, revenge, the search for power
and violence. This violence is in many cases indirectly financed by innocent
elements.
<p><b>The Financing of Islamist groups</b>
<p>The aforementioned factors are very important not only to the understanding
of the Islamist phenomenon, but to the explanation of the complexity of
the financial and economic system of the Islamist groups. To the above-mentioned
factors we should add the significant involvement of Arab and Islamic states
in the financing of Islamic activities—not only at social and cultural
activities, but terrorism and political violence as well. On one hand,
countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Sudan, and Pakistan, give—whether
directly or through official and unofficial foundations and companies—enormous
sums of money to Islamic movements. This money goes to a wide range of
Islamic organizations, and to foundations, associations, institutions,
charity associations, projects, and institutes all over the world. Many
of these bodies serve as front organizations for groups that engage in
terrorism.
<p>On the other hand, most of this financing feeds—directly or indirectly—an
atmosphere based upon violent Islamist perceptions, thus encouraging public
support for the phenomenon in general, and for the various groups in particular.
Very often, especially in the case of Saudi Arabia and some of the Gulf
States, wealthy individuals donate a good deal of money to Islamic movements
or projects directly or through private foundations. Although these donations
are private, in most cases they come from officials or individuals of high
public position in their countries, or even members of the royal families.
The donations are thus perceived as part of governmental support.
<p><b>Criminal Activities</b>
<p>An additional factor that is of importance to the public support for
Islamic movements and groups, including the violent ones, is the comparative
confidence in matters of financial integrity enjoyed by their activists
as men of religion or religious authorities. Most of these groups are generally
perceived as dedicating their activities to the public interest, and free
of corruption. Paradoxes such as the cultivation of narcotic plants and
drug trafficking in order to finance Islamist groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan
or Lebanon are forgiven in such societies. In these countries this is a
legitimate enterprise, particularly if the narcotics are used for commerce
and not for personal use or distribution among Islamic societies. Some
Islamic groups that actually fight drug dealers engage in the treatment
of drug addicts, sometimes publicly state that the distribution of drugs
among the “infidels” is permitted, although there is no known public Islamic
ruling that permits this.
<p>Most of the Islamic and Islamist groups do not engage in the type of
criminal activities common to non-Islamic terrorist groups all over the
world, such as bank robberies,[5] burglary, extortion and criminal threats,
kidnapping for ransom, etc. In the past three decades there have been many
cases of hijacking of planes and marine vehicles, the kidnapping of tourists
or military and government officials. However this was usually done in
order to win the release Islamist prisoners and not to finance terrorist
groups. There were raids on arsenals and the theft of military equipment.
But, in all of these cases the groups involved managed to maintain their
public image free from the stain of criminality. Although there are, again
no known public or internal religious rulings that permit such acts, in
the case of attacks against non-Muslims, they have a kind of ideological
legitimacy in the framework of “the struggle of self defense against the
infidels.”
<p>A few exceptions in this regard are small terrorist groups, whose Sheikhs
pronounce religious rulings permitting robbery of non-Muslims for the financing
of the group. Sheikh Asa`d Bayoud al-Tamimi, one of the religious authorities
of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in 1983 issued a ruling permitting his
followers to steal the property of Jews.[6] In the course of the investigation
that followed the assassination of the late President Anwar al-Sadat in
October 1981, Egyptian Islamists from the Egyptian Islamic Jihad admitted
robbing jewelry stores owned by Christian Copts in Cairo and Upper Egypt,
based upon a religious ruling.[7] In the trial of Egyptian Returnees from
Albania, or “The Arab Balkans,” in 1999, members of the Egyptian Islamic
Jihad confessed that some members had, while living in Jordan, Yemen, and
Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, planned to rob jewelry shops in those countries.
Unknown Sheikhs issued a special Fatwah for the purpose.[8] It should be
noted that they failed to carry out the plans because they could not obtain
the necessary weapons, had no escape routes, and did not know how to sell
the jewelry for cash or how to smuggle it. This means that they had neither
the “criminal mind” nor any link to criminal circles.
<p>In the investigations that followed the arrest in December 1999 of a
large group in Jordan linked to Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qa`idah organization,
some of the detainees admitted to planning the robbery of Christians in
Jordan to finance their activities. It was not known whether they had a
religious ruling for that.[9] Some Islamists were involved in 1999 in the
kidnapping of tourists in Northern Yemen for ransom, but it appeared that
this activity was part of the widespread phenomenon of kidnapping among
the Yemenite tribes there. Involvement of terrorism, guerrilla warfare,
and criminal activity of Islamist groups is widespread in Chechnya and
the Caucasus, as it was in Bosnia, Albania and Kossovo. But, it would seem
that this is a result of the political and economic culture in those regions,
and connected to nationalist groups that carry out a struggle more nationalist
than Islamic in nature.
<p>A prominent exception, far from the Middle East, is the Islamist radical
group, Abu Sayyaf, in the Southern Philippines, which has turned the kidnapping
of Western tourists, Christian missionaries and local businessmen into
a thriving industry. This group, which split in 1991 from the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), has, according to Philippine military officials,
raked in some $5.5 Million from ransoms. Most of the money is spent on
buying arms.[10] The case of the Abu Sayyaf is unique among Islamist groups,
and there is considerable doubt whether the group acts on the basis of
religious Islamic rulings, like the MNLF, its father group. However, there
is an interesting connection between these groups, especially in recent
years. This is their links to Al-Qa`idah and the increasing role of the
Egyptian and Palestinian Islamists connected with Bin Laden, whether in
Afghanistan, or various other regions. It seems that, whether they have
religious ruling for criminal activity against non-Muslims or not, Al-Qa`idah’s
perception of the global struggle, together with Bin Laden’s <i>Fatwah</i>
of February 1998, gives them the legitimacy to commit criminal acts against
the “infidels.”[11]
<p>Islamic organizations that engage in social and communal activity alongside
their terrorist activities—such as Hizballah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian
territories, Harakat ul-Ansar in Pakistan, and others—also enjoy public
support and sympathy for their efficiency in assisting the public. In this,
they usually perform better than their governments. The most prominent
such groups in the Middle East are those that belong to the Muslim Brotherhood
or their school. The Brotherhood developed a comprehensive organizational
theory of the formation of a totally independent economic infrastructure.
This economic activity is integrated in the religious duties of charity,
and hence, is sometimes immune from the attacks of the hostile regimes.
However, in many cases this same immunity provides the primary cover and
legitimacy for fund-raising, the transfer of money and the financing of
subversive or terrorist activity.
<p><b>Muslim communities in the West</b>
<p>There is a very important element in the financing of Islamist terrorist
groups and the globalization of Islamist terrorism that has not yet been
sufficiently observed by Western countries. This is the establishment of
large Muslim communities in the West, and their growing alienation from
the surrounding societies. Hatred of foreigners in the major countries
in Europe, poverty and unemployment, difficulties in coping with Western
modernization and values, clash of values and cultures, and disintegration
of family values, have brought about an increase in social and political
activity of Islamist activists in these communities. Islamic social and
welfare movements, which are not part of the radical trend, help in creating
the Islamic atmosphere that directly and indirectly assists the radicals,
particularly in fund raising, recruitment of supporters and members, establishing
all kinds of institutions, and distributing publications. Above all, they
attempt to implant in growing Muslim societies in the West the perception
of Western culture as the enemy—the party of the devil (<i>Hizb al-Shaytan</i>)
set against the true believers, the party of God (<i>Hizballah</i>).
<p>An important example of the consolidation of Muslim communities has
been led by the Pakistani Dr. Kalim Siddiqui, who lived for many years
in London and directed the Islamic cultural center of the pro-Iranian circles
there. Siddiqui, who was one of the first Islamic ideologues to talk about
the globalization of the Islamic struggle, was behind the theory of the
<i>“Non-territorial
Islamic State.”</i> In the framework of this ideology he established in
the 1980s the Muslim Parliament of the UK—an attempt to create an Islamic
body to represent all the different groups of Muslims in the UK, who came
from different Muslim countries and various Islamic sub-cultures and trends.
He viewed the Muslim parliament not just as the minority political system
for Muslims in Britain. The parliament was meant to be, first of all, the
basis for the “Non-territorial Islamic State.” The key word for him was
<i>power</i>—the
State was the instrument by which a community could exercise its collective
power in action.[12] The “non-territorial Islamic state” may in the coming
years become a major factor in Islamic communities in the West, both for
the improvement of their own status, and as the backbone of certain Islamic
and Islamist groups that fail to establish such a state in their homelands.
The issue of financing would probably be a prominent factor too in socially
changing societies that reside in materialistic surroundings.
<p>In many cases Islamist activists influence is greatest on those Muslim
publics whose religious knowledge is poor. As a consequence of social pressures,
these people tend to adopt motives that sometimes lack religious rules
or norms, emphasizing instead the social and political confrontation. The
radical perception of Jihad is therefore quite attractive to many of them.
According to press reports quoting court papers of US prosecutors, this
element has been used by Bin Laden through international companies and
relief organizations acting as front organizations, in obtaining US residences,
with which they could communicate by fax, satellite phones and coded letters.[13]
<p>A good recent example of the use of Muslim communities in the West is
the story of the Algerian Ahmad Rassam who was arrested on 14 December
1999 on the US- Canadian border. His arrest and subsequent arrests in the
US and Canada, revealed a plot by the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA
in French) to carry out terrorist operations in different places in the
US on the occasion of the Millennium. American investigators linked this
plot to Bin Laden and his global struggle. Rassam was part of the growing
Algerian community in Montreal, where according to press reports “people
seeking refugee status can drop from sight despite arrest warrants and
deportation orders.” He entered Canada in 1994 with a forged French passport
and applied for asylum, claiming that he fled from torture and persecution.
He did not show up at the hearing on his refugee claim and was therefore
denied. He was arrested in August 1995 on an order of deportation, but
was released after a month and was asked to arrange his status with the
immigration authorities, which he failed to do. Only in May 1998 did immigration
officials issue an arrest warrant for him. By that time, he was not to
be found. In June 1998 he was arrested for theft but was not detained by
the immigration authorities and again disappeared among the 30,000 Algerians
living in Montreal.[14]
<p>Statistics and data published by various bodies of the United Nations
show a growing number of people from Muslim countries who seek refuge and
asylum, mainly in Germany (40%), the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
France. The number of Algerians seeking refuge or political asylum in Europe
in the years 1990-1993 for example increased from 1600 to 14,000 per year.[15]
In February 1998, the German Minister of Interior decided on a temporary
ban on the deportation of Algerians in response to the upsurge in violence
in Algeria. An estimated 6,500 rejected Algerian asylum seekers remained
in Germany in 1998. The number of first-time asylum seekers in Germany
in 1998 was 143,429, most of them from Muslim countries including Bosnia
and Albania. This was a decrease from the 1992 numbers—438,191—but in general
the number of Muslim immigrants to Germany itself was over one million
people.[16]
<p>The major violent events in the 1990s—the Gulf war, the Iraqi war against
its Kurds, Bosnia, Albania, Kossovo, Afghanistan, Algeria, Chechnya, and
elsewhere—brought waves of Muslim immigrants to West European countries,
seeking refuge, political asylum and work. This is besides the “regular”
immigrants, many of them illegal that do not appear in the official statistics.
In the second half of the 1990s, the UK faced a significant increase of
asylum seekers and refugees, leading the government to announce in July
1998 an administrative reform. This was intended to clear “the huge backlog
of asylum applications” through a parliamentary White Paper called “Fairer,
Faster, Firmer – a modern approach to immigration and asylum.”[17]
<p>Muslim immigrants to the US are a minority among the enormous number
of immigrants from all over the world, but the statistics published by
both the US and the UN show a significant increase in the past decade.
The US is very active in seeking solutions by resettlement of refugees
from areas of risk in other countries, but during the 1990s, Washington
had to increase the admission of refugees to the US as well.[18] Statistics
of political asylum cases approved by immigration judges in the US between
1989-1999 show that only 22.4% of the applications were approved. But,
in the case of Muslim countries, such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia,
Iran, and Iraq, the majority of the applications were approved.[19]
<p>The increasing number of Muslim immigrants to Europe and the US is a
result of the political violence in Muslim countries in the 1990s. In many
cases those immigrants and asylum seekers were actively involved in violent
events and may be easily affected by extreme radical Islamist ideas.
<p>In most cases the long-term goals of many radical groups are vague.
They tend to speak in terms of an eternal global mission in accordance
with the basics of orthodox Islam, whose victory, which, according to their
belief is sure to come about, may be accomplished only in the far future.
They also lack normal political observance, and therefore are not pragmatic
except for in cases where they are confronted by force, as happened in
the second half of the 1990s. When Arab regimes started to fight the Islamists
by force, we have witnessed the start of a move from terrorist groups to
the demand to become legitimate political movements and parties. This happened
during 1998-99 in Egypt, Algeria, the Yemen, and partially affected the
relations between Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). A
very important element in this regard was the significant decline of public
support for these groups in their homelands, as a result of their murderous
operations, mainly during the last years in Algeria. This was also the
case following the operation in Luxor in November 1997 in Egypt, which
shocked the Egyptian public and the Islamic establishment. But, this process
is also part of the shift of Islamist terrorism to globalization. Islamist
groups started targeting the growing Muslim communities in the West in
order to seek support.
<p>A crucial element in the 1990s and if we look at the near future, is
the massive fund raising for all kinds of Islamic activity in Europe and
the US. In many cases the money is spent on social and cultural projects,
either for the benefit of Muslim population in the West or in the Arab
countries. But part of it is raised by various radical Islamist groups
or by front organizations and institutions established by them. US officials
reported that they have discovered that a significant number of Islamic
terrorists were concealing their activities and sources of funds by using
charitable organizations as fronts. Many of these charities do substantial
community service work. Such investigations are not easy and can raise
allegations of targeting religious or ethnic groups.[20]
<p>An Algerian immigrant to Canada who was writing a doctoral thesis on
Islamic groups claimed that Canada has served as a transit point for much
of the $137 Million raised worldwide for the Islamic movements in Algeria.
He found that GIA was using tactics ranging from special taxes to outright
extortion to raise money funneled through Canada. The group had only a
little support among the Algerians in Montreal, but exploited the freedom
under the Canadian Rights Charter to operate in that country.[21]
<p><b>The Means of Financing</b>
<p>The means of financing terrorist groups in the Middle East vary from
direct transfer of cash to terrorist groups by special couriers,[22] and
a variety of legitimate bank accounts, to the financing of a wide range
of associations, institutions for social and educational projects, hospitals,
orphans and other humanitarian goals.
<p>The money is transferred to the Arab or Muslim World by means both sophisticated
and secret, but in most cases <i>legitimate</i>, transactions—through bank
accounts in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Some of the Islamic
institutions in the West are used also to launder large sums of money transferred
from different countries or wealthy individuals, primarily in Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and some other Gulf states. During the 1990s this transfer
of money has gradually increased. Following the decision by the Gulf States
to cease financing the PLO because of its position in the Gulf war, these
states shifted their financial support to Islamic groups, organizations
and projects. This led to the foundation of many kinds of institutions,
cultural centers, publications, research institutes and welfare associations
one of whose main goals was fund raising and money laundering. This was
in addition to the use of these organizations for the spread of radical
Islamist messages among Muslim populations in the West.
<p>The financing of social projects in Muslim societies in the Middle East
and, in the 1990s, in the Balkans, and in Central and Southern Asia is
a controversial issue in many cases. The Saudi example in this case is
the most controversial. On the one hand, the Saudi government is the greatest
financier of Muslim relief organizations in the world. But, on the other
hand, by doing so it in certain areas directly assists publics that support
Islamist terrorist groups, thus indirectly assisting these groups. There
are numerous reports concerning one of the Saudi official relief organizations—The
International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO)—that it provides financial
support to Wahhabi groups in the Middle East and Central Asia. Other recent
reports from the Philippine government even connect IIRO to Bin Laden,
claiming that he uses the organization as a front for the financing of
the Abu Sayyaf group and the MNLF. The reliability of these reports is
not known.[23]
<p>According to IIRO publications found on its website, in the period of
1987-1995, the organization donated 418 million US dollars, 140 million
of which (33.4%) to “special projects.”[24] These special projects, unlike
other issues such as education, health, social welfare, or goods donation,
are not detailed. This does not mean that IIRO is financing terrorism,
but some of their projects fund various activities that indirectly serve
terrorist groups and the support for them. The IIRO is connected with the
Saudi governmental organization of the Muslim World League (MWL), the biggest
Islamic relief organization in the world, which has over 100 branches in
more than 30 countries.[25] The organization, together with the largest
Kuwaiti Islamic Relief organization, has often been accused by Arab governments—Egypt
in particular—of financing Islamist terrorist groups
<p>The issue of the financing of Islamist terrorism was raised in recent
years mainly with regard to Osama Bin Laden, who appears in many documents,
press reports—and probably intelligence report—as the wealthiest financier
of terrorism currently active. In April 2000, the British <i>Times</i>
published a report from British intelligence sources, concerning an investigation
by the British security agencies of reports that Bin Laden “has been funding
young British Muslims at armed training camps.” The reports claimed that
“militant Islamic groups” recruited and sent 200 British youngsters to
desert camps in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Sudan.” Some of them took
part in battles and were killed.[26]
<p>Bin Laden’s actual wealth is not publicly known, and the range of his
wealth as reported by the Media is between millions and billions of $US.
His family, which owns an empire of business companies in the field of
constructions in Saudi Arabia, is indeed quite wealthy. However, the Saudi
authorities deported Bin Laden in 1994, and since then he has found refuge
in the Sudan and, after 1996, in Afghanistan. There is no reliable information
about his real fortune and how much of it is invested in terrorist operations.
Furthermore, in the past two years since the terrorist explosions of the
American embassies in East Africa in August 1998, he has resided in a limited
area in Afghanistan. Although he is secured by the patronage of the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan, we may assume that his ability to run businesses
from there is very limited, if it is possible at all. According to American
intelligence reports Bin Laden is also suffering from several diseases
of the bones and kidneys, and is due to be replaced as head of al-Qaidah
in the near future by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the Egyptian
Islamic Jihad group.[27] Other reports claim that Bin Laden is even dying
of liver disease.
<p>In fact, there are hints that his funding of terrorist operations is
limited. For example, there is the case of the Jordanian group arrested
in December 1999, which Jordanian authorities suspected of being linked
bin Laden. In their confessions, as published in the Jordanian press, they
confessed to planning robberies in order to finance their activities, and
to receiving very small sums of money from abroad, no more than $2000 US.[28]
This may prove that Bin Laden did not finance them and that the reports
about his financing of terrorist groups and operations are far from reality.
This story was repeated in the case of a Palestinian Islamist group uncovered
by Israeli security service in April-June 2000, whose leader was linked
to Bin Laden. Most of their finance came from Hamas sources. In an investigation
into an alleged Bin Laden network in the United States in 1999, about $11,000
was sent from the US to an Islamist activist linked to Bin Laden in the
Middle East. In other words, the transfer went the other way: certainly
not the way it is supposed to work in the case of a terrorist network financed
by Bin Laden.[29]
<p>In general, the issue of the financing of Islamist terrorism appears
somewhat exaggerated in the media or in the rhetoric of politicians. This
is a very difficult issue to research relying on open sources. It would
seem that the vast majority of the money raised by Islamic movements, groups
and organizations is spent on their social and welfare activity, rather
than directly on terrorism. However, taking into consideration the afore-mentioned
pyramid of Islamic activity, the Islamist terrorist groups and global Islamist
networks, indirectly enjoy a good deal of support from this fund raising.
<p>This has started to decline in the past two years in the US, as a result
of legislation and federal investigations, particularly in the case of
the Palestinian Islamist groups, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
But none of the American steps has so far been taken in any of the European
countries, which continue to be an ideal greenhouse for Islamist radical
activity, and above all the UK. The countering of this kind of terrorism,
even by legislation and other non-violent means, particularly by international
cooperation, is crucial in the fight against radical Islamist terrorism.
If European countries join the US in this field it could lead to the decline
of the massive fund raising at the very least.
<p>British authorities took their first real move in this direction only
recently, in January 2000. The British Charities Commission issued a ruling
that stripped a charity associated with the Muslim Cultural Society of
its tax-exempt status, and declared that the organization could no longer
be called a charity. This charity was directed by Sheikh Omar Muhammad
Bakri, a known ex-Tahrir activist in the Islamic circles in the UK, who
heads a group called Al-Muhajiroun. British press reports claimed that
he was also the head of the political wing of the Islamic Political Front
(IPF), which has sent British volunteers to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bosnia
and Chechnya. The military wing of the IPF was allegedly founded by Bin
Laden.[30]
<p>A good example of the real goals of various Islamist institutions and
centers established in the US and Europe in the last decade, is an internal
document written in the early 1990s by activists of one of the most radical
Middle Eastern Islamist groups, the pro-Iranian Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The document sets forth a comprehensive plan to establish a hostile intelligence
organization in the US and elsewhere. Among other things it states, “Our
presence in North America gives us a unique opportunity to monitor, explore
and follow-up… We are in the center that leads the conspiracy against our
Islamic world. Therefore, here we can monitor and watch the American policies
and the activities of those questionable organizations, establish a center
for studies, intelligence and information.” Part of the activities of this
“center for studies” is “military training programs, benefiting from the
available opportunities that exist in this country.”[31] This institute
has been under investigation by US authorities for the past five years.
<p><b>Conclusion: Targeting the financing of terrorist groups</b>
<p>The most important elements in the financing of Islamist terrorist groups
are the public support given by Islamic societies and communities in the
Middle East or elsewhere in the Muslim World, as well as in the West, to
the socio-political messages and interpretations presented by these groups
under the guise of religion. The social element is important in the financing
of these groups, since the social, welfare, charity, and relief activity
is an essential element in the consolidation of communities that support
such groups.
<p>Even in cases where Islamic societies or parts of them, do not support
terrorism <i>per ce, </i>in many cases they support the atmosphere of anti-Western
or anti-Jewish messages of Islamist terrorist groups. This factor is vital
in the ability of terrorist groups in the Middle East, or Middle Eastern
terrorist groups elsewhere<i>,</i> to raise funds, launder money through
legitimate institutions, and maintain financial facilities.
<p>Among Muslim communities in the West there has been a social change
in the past decade or two. The first generation of immigrants sought to
merge into Western society and was much occupied with economic difficulties.
The expectations of the second and third generations of immigrants were
in many cases unfulfilled, reinforcing their alienation from the Western
societies that surround them. Although in many countries, primarily the
United Kingdom, Scandinavia and Germany, they were granted generous economic
support, as well as freedom of speech and activity, organization and education,
there was a flood of financial support from the wealthier Muslim countries
that assisted them in building and promoting their own communities.
<p>The Westerners’ resentment of foreigners in their midst, and the ongoing
difficulties of coping with modernization, unemployment and traditional
culture, allowed a wide range of Islamic infrastructure to thrive in the
Western democratic system, which could serve as a most suitable greenhouse
for Islamist movements and groups and their financing. A variety of associations
in London, or research institutes in the United States, for example, could
serve as the backbone of terrorist Islamist groups for diverse goals: recruitment,
fund-raising, publications, communications and so on. This element seems
to reinforce the internationalization of Islamist terrorism in the Middle
East or Asia. Thus, the growing feeling of alienation among Muslim youth
is perhaps the most important factor in analyzing the prospects of future
Islamist terrorism in general, and the financing of terrorist groups in
particular.
<p>The list of Middle Eastern and Asian Islamic relief organizations is
enormous, and most of them are active in Western countries, where the supervision
over them is very difficult under democratic laws. Most of them have very
active Internet websites to promote their activities, primarily among Muslim
communities in the West.
<p>There have been only a few cases in which governments or security services
succeeded in proving the link between such funds or associations and terrorist
activity. In most cases there were investigations that led no where. Foundations
like Interpal in the UK, Holy Land Foundation in Texas, USA, Al-Aqsa Foundation
in Germany, and others, were subject to investigation without any real
success. One reason for the lack of success was insufficient cooperation
between countries, along with differing views on how to deal with terrorism
in general, and with this kind of religious terrorism in particular.
<p>These differences exist not only between Western countries—particularly
the European Commonwealth and the United States—but also between Arab and
Middle Eastern countries. The disputes in the Arab world are especially
detrimental to countering the financing of Islamist terrorist groups, since
a major part of the financing comes indirectly from Arab governments, institutions
or wealthy individuals. The issue of financing Islamist terrorist groups
was in some cases a source of accusations of Arab governments toward other
Arab states. A good example was the accusation made by the Egyptian government
against Kuwait.[32]
<p>In the last years there have been several initiatives on the international
or national plane to block the funding of Islamist groups. In his testimony
before the International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives
in July 2000, Ambassador Michael Sheehan, Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism
in the US State Department, stated:
<blockquote>“One of the most important ways to combat terrorism is to disrupt
the financing of terrorist groups and activities… The ability of terrorists
operating in Afghanistan, for example, to obtain funds and other material
support is a symptom of the other primary trend in terrorism: the shift
from terrorist groups sponsored by states to international networks of
terrorists not affiliated with particular governments.”[33]</blockquote>
On 9 December 1999, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted
the <i>International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism </i>[34]<i> </i>on the initiative of France. So far, only 25
countries have signed the convention and no one has ratified it.[35] The
last one to sign so far was India, which signed in September. But, the
convention can come into force only after 23 countries ratify it. This
situation reflects the main obstacle for targeting the financing of terrorism:
the absence of real international cooperation. This is not new, but the
decline of sponsoring terrorism by states should make this cooperation
easier to achieve, since national political interests and considerations
towards certain states no longer exist. Countries like Russia, India, and
China, joined the Western countries that for years suffer from Islamist
terrorism, in the call for better cooperation, but the real advance in
cooperation is still very slow.
<p>Wherein lies the problem, and what is the main obstacle?
<p>The “ordinary” obstacle lies in the different interests of different
countries, and suspicion and competition in their relationships with Muslim
countries. These are all natural factors in international relations. In
the case of the war in Bosnia, Albania, and Kossovo, the Muslim rebels
were the “good guys” and the Serbians were the “bad guys.” In the case
of Chechnya, the “bad guys” are the Islamic rebels who are assisted by
a battalion of “Arab Afghans” accused of links to Bin Laden.
<p>But the main obstacle the failure to deal with internal socio-political
problems. This paper cannot cover the whole field of analyzing the solutions
for the socio-economic problems of Muslim communities in the West or Muslim
societies in the Middle East. But, in the narrow field of countering the
financing of terrorist groups there must first of all be better understanding
of the importance of the role of Islamic infrastructures as the main source
of financial support for Islamist terrorist groups. Much better supervision
over such infrastructures does not necessarily mean fighting Islam, even
though Muslim communities and countries would like to present it as such.
Such supervision must be accompanied not only by international conventions,
but also by national and <i>coordinated </i>conventions in different Western
and Middle Eastern countries. Legislation, such as that passed by the United
States in 1996 and after, should be imitated by other countries and parliaments.
A side benefit of such legislation would be better cooperation between
countries.
<p>Last but not least, is the cooperation between countries in the field
of intelligence. Information should be exchanged between polices and security
services about institutes and associations that serve as financing bases
for terrorist groups, and not only in the case of terrorist operations
in progress, but on a regular basis. The globalization of Islamist terrorist
networks should be followed by the <i>globalization of cooperation</i>
in countering them.

dealt with the IRA and Irish terror groups. See: John Horgan and Max Taylor,

<font size=-1>It should be noted that even in “Patterns of Global Terrorism,”

<font size=-1>There were a few cases in which Islamist small groups planned
to attack banks, not for robbery but in order to cause economic damage.
The Egyptian Islamic Jihad, for example, planned to attack banks in Egypt
because they did not follow Islamic Shari`ah. A member of the Egyptian
group of Returnees from Albania told interrogators that the famous <i>Fatwah</i>
of Ibn Taymiyyah against the Tatars applied to the banks. <i>Al- Sharq
al-Awsat</i> (London), 8 March 1999, p. 10. In March 1999, the Egyptian
authorities accused members of the group of “Returnees from Albania” in
planting explosives in front of three Egyptian banks in 1994. <i>Al-Sharq
al-Awsat, 9 March 1999.</i></font></li>

<font size=-1>For example, in two cases on 1990 and December 1992, a special
courier arrived at Israel with suitcases of 100,000 US$ each, in order
to give the money to Hamas activists. In his interrogation and trial he
confessed that the money was aimed at the reorganization of the terrorist
activity of the movement. But, it should be noted that the money was transferred
for the terrorist activity and not for the social activities. This might
mean that in the case of Hamas, there was total separation between the
two fields of activity.</font></li>
