<p><b>Dr. Ely Karmon</b>
<br><b>ICT Senior Researcher</b>
<p><img SRC="../graphics/neo-nazism.gif" height=183 width=175 align=RIGHT><b>Background</b>
<br>Investigators into the explosion of a shrapnel bomb on July 27, 2000
in a Duesseldorf train station have determined that the attack may have
been racially motivated. All of the people injured in the blast were recent
immigrants from the former Soviet Union—from Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Russia.
In addition, six of them Jews.
<p>The group may have been intentionally targeted. They were in the habit
of walking as a group from the station to a German class and back at the
same times every weekday, making them a potential target for a remote control
device.
<p>According to media reports, the German police are focusing on far-right
groups in their investigation. CNN reported that just two days before the
blast, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had said he was fed up with the growing
number of racist attacks. He was quoted as saying that xenophobia was a
serious threat to domestic security as well as Germany’s foreign image.[1]
<p>Johannes Mocken, spokesman for state prosecutors was quoted as saying,
“We know that there is an extreme-right scene in Dusseldorf. But the existence
of a right-wing scene in Dusseldorf doesn’t necessarily mean that they
would commit such a serious crime.” He added that such an attack has no
precedent in recent years. Police in the neighboring state of Lower Saxony
reported a wave of neo-Nazi graffiti in the days prior to the bombing.
The graffiti appeared at bus stops, on garage doors and cigarette machines.
However, there was no obvious connection between the two incidents.[2]
<p>Two weeks prior to the attack, Heinz Fromm, the President of the German
Security Service (Bundesamt f&uuml;r Verfassungsschutz - BfV) warned in
an interview to the Berlin daily <i>Tagenspiegel </i>of the increasing
danger of terrorist attacks by right-wing extremist groups in Germany.
<p><b>Right wing activities on the rise</b>
<br>According to the last annual report of the BfV, 10,034 offenses were
registered as having either proved or suspected right-wing extremist motives
in 1999, compared with 11,049 in 1998. But these included 746 acts of violence
in 1999, compared with the 708 in 1998, which means that the acts of violence
rose by by 5.4% during the last year.[3] (See the abridged English version
of the report at <a href="http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/publikationen/gesamt/page5.html" target="_new">http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/publikationen/gesamt/page5.html</a>
<p>If we look at the number of militants involved in right-wing radical
activities the same trend appears. The number of organized and non-organized
right-wing extremists has diminished by about 4 % to approximately 51,400
in total against the preceding year’s 53,600. About 37,000 people are organized
in right-wing extremist legal parties, while the 1998 figure was 39,800.
The Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) with 7,000 members and the REPUBLIKANER (REP)
with 14,000 members have suffered a decrease in membership by approximately
1000 whereas the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) has been
stable at 6,000 members.
<p>However, the number of violence-prone right-wing extremists has risen
by about 10 % from 8,200 in 1998 to 9,000, thus continuing the growth trend
established since 1996.[4] Violence-prone individuals also include right-wing
extremists, who, while advocating the use of force, refrain from committing
acts of violence themselves. These include the right-wing extremist skinheads,
who represent the strongest group (85 %) within violence-prone right-wing
extremism. But skinheads dislike firm structures and seldom integrate into
right-wing extremist organizations.
<p>In 1999 individual activists demanded a more violence-orientated strategy
to enforce their political aims. For years there have been indications
that these individuals possess firearms and explosives, though without
the motivation to use them. In parts of the right-wing extremist scene,
however, there have been more and more signs of rising militancy.[5]
<p>It should be remembered that in June 1998, German police discovered
large caches of weapons at several locations around the country, containing
automatic and semi-automatic weapons, shells, mortars, machine guns and
grenades, along with Nazi insignia and uniforms. In March 1999, a bomb
exploded at an exhibition about war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht during
World War Two. The bomb, believed to have been planted by neo-Nazis, showed
a level of technical sophistication not previously seen from the German
far right. More recently, further arrests followed the discovery of bomb-making
equipment, including chemicals, timers, batteries, steel pipes and detonators.[6]
<p>Violent acts against foreigners and members of ethnic minorities have
become daily occurrences in many districts, though special police units
have helped somewhat to control violence in the streets. Since 1990 at
least 16 people have been killed by right-wing extremists, motivated by
xenophobia and/or anti-Semitism.[7]
<p>In 1998 there were 991 anti-Semitically-motivated crimes, an increase
of 1.5 percent. In Berlin alone, the number of anti-Semitic incidents increased
by 20 percent. Most of the incidents were propaganda and defamation offenses,
but desecration of Jewish cemeteries and sites (synagogues, museums and
memorials) continued in 1998 at the same level as in previous years. A
noteworthy example was the vandalism of the memorial to deported Jews in
Berlin, on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Reichsprogromnacht. The
most serious violent anti-Semitic incidents were two arson attacks in September
and December that destroyed the grave of Heinz Galinski, an important leader
of the Jewish community in Germany after World War II.[8]
<p><b>Developments on the neo-Nazism scene</b>
<br>A number of the executive measures have been taken in recent years
by the BfV and other German security agencies against right-wing extremist
activities, including a ban on associations, prohibition of assemblies,
searches, arrests, convictions. As a result, neo-Nazis have been seeking
to develop new forms of action. In order to evade protective and preemptive
measures taken by the state, leading neo-Nazis are particularly involved
in setting up new structures aimed at preserving or even improving their
ability to act.
<p>The neo-Nazi scene has in particular preferred the formation of “autonomous
comradeships.” This includes the creation of loose, non-organizational
structures rather than the former firm, association-like organizations.
Their coherence is to be ensured by information networking, i.e. the use
of modern means of communication.[9]
<p><b>Organizations</b>
<br>At the end of 1998, according to the BfV, there were 114 extreme right
organizations and groups, compared to 109 in 1997. This is up about 11
percent from the previous year. By now, there are at least 150 such groups.
The number of neo-Nazis dropped about 8 % from 2,400 in 1998 to 2,200,
however, the number of organizations rose from 41 in 1998 to 49.
<p>According to the Anti-Semitism Worldwide 1998/9 Report by The Stephen
Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism and Racism at
Tel Aviv University, the umbrella organization Nationaler Widerstand (Nationalist
Resistance) represents the basic concepts, goals and targets of the radical
right and neo-Nazi action groups. Under the motto “Unity will lead to victory,”
these concepts include:
<ul>
<li>
Our nation is our race;</li>

<li>
No to a “multi-cultural” society;</li>

<li>
The re-establishment of an independent national state;</li>

<li>
An end to “globalization.”</li>
</ul>
Under the guise of humanitarian groups that support prisoners and their
families, The following organizations are increasing their membership and
influence amongst the radical right, both nationally and internationally:
<ul>
<li>
Hilfsorganisation f&uuml;r nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angeh&ouml;rige
e. V. (Support Organization for National Political Prisoners and Their
Relatives—HNG), with a 19 percent rise in membership in 1998, is now considered
the largest neo-Nazi group in Germany;</li>

<li>
Internationales Hilfskomitee f&uuml;r nationale politische Verfolgte und
deren Angeh&ouml;rige e. V. (International Support Commfor National Socialist
Victims of Persecution—IHV);</li>

<li>
Kameradschaftswerk f&uuml;r nationale Gefangene (Fellowship for Nationalist
Prisoners);</li>

<li>
Gefangenenhilfe der Nationalen e. V. (Support Organization for Prisoners
of Die Nationalen [see ASW 1997/ 8]);</li>

<li>
Nationalfreiheitliche Gefangenenhilfe (National Freedom Prisoner Support).[10]</li>
</ul>
The skinhead organizations “Blood &amp; Honour” and “Hammerskins” with
an international range of action have succeeded in extending their influence
among German skinheads. This is largely due to the fact that some of their
leading members have belonged to the neo-Nazi skinhead scene for a number
of years and as a result have organizational experience derived from the
neo-Nazis’ political work as well as contacts in skinhead circles. The
increase in influence owes even more to the organization of concerts and
the fact that the magazine “Blood &amp; Honour” became the most important
skinhead-structure by the end of 1999.
<p>For a number of years German neo-Nazi agitation has been focusing on
economical and social issues: unemployment and the “flood of asylum seekers.”
But they also chose other subjects close to current concerns for their
agitation. In 1999 they campaigned against the exhibition on crimes committed
by the German Wehrmacht, often in cooperation with the NPD. In addition
they ran an “anti-NATO campaign” during the NATO-intervention in Kosovo
in the Spring of 1999, in order to attract public attention and to achieve
acceptance in the general political contest. Considerable numbers of neo-Nazis
can be mobilised only on a few occasions, in general only in joint action
with the extreme right-wing parties such as the NPD. Independent nationwide
actions on the occasion of the twelfth anniversary of Rudolf Hess’ death
(17 August) failed. Moreover, a few small regional demonstrations were
prevented by the security authorities.[11]
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>The recent wave of terrorism indicates that the various groups and
individuals active in the wider right-wing sphere have learned the lessons
of the past, have adapted to the modern environment and feel sufficiently
confident to up-grade and intensify their violent aggression against the
democratic societies. In recent years the technical knowledge needed to
build offensive weapons has been available not only in neo-Nazi literature
but also on the Internet. Another characteristic of the recent terrorist
activity is the large number of anti-Semitic incidents, although the general
background is racist and xenophobic. Far right groups have certainly used
terrorism in the past, but the ubiquity of neo-Nazi terrorist attacks in
1999 was a global escalation from which the neo-Nazi movement is unlikely
to retreat.
<p>It seems that the neo-Nazi and radical right-wing terrorism in Germany
follows the patterns seen these last two years around the world, mainly
in the Unites States, Britain, Sweden and Russia. Though it does not threaten
the population at large, right-wing terrorism—enhanced by the huge coverage
of modern media—represents mainly a political and psychological danger
to the stability of democratic societies.[12]
<p>The BfV report for 1999 concluded that the developement in German right-wing
extremism is not uniform and no right-wing extremist organization is presently
committing serious offences to enforce their political objectives. The
warning by the president of the BfV two weeks ago shows that the German
authorities arrived at the conclusion that the threat is growing since
the beginning of 2000. The Dusseldorf attack has only served to reaffirm
this evaluation.
