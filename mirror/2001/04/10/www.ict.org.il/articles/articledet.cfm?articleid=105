<p><center><h2>Hamas Analyzes its Terrorist Activity</h2></center>
<P><b>Reuven Paz</b>

<p><p><b>Preface</b>
<br>In the past two years there seems to be a decline in both the quantity
and quality of Hamas terrorist activity. Israeli politicians and journalists,
as well as many observers from the Israeli security community tend to analyze
this decline as meaning that although the movement is attempting to continue
its massive terrorist activity, this attempt fails due to Israeli and Palestinian
success in uncovering its activity. Others tend to emphasize—usually for
political reasons—the Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in the security field
as the main reason for the decline. The Palestinians also seems to be very
keen on giving maximum exposure to its pressures on Hamas, both political
and military.
<p>On the other hand, there are observers who, like this author, believe
that although the Israeli-Palestinian cooperation and the pressure on Hamas
play a prominent role, this is not the whole story. On the contrary, the
change in Hamas activity and the decline in its terrorist operations result
primarily from the movement’s own decisions rather than its inability to
carry out these operations.
<p><b>Constant reevaluation of Hamas’ positions</b>
<br>The leaders of Hamas, especially the local leaders in the Palestinian
Authority—and primarily in the Gaza Strip—are fully aware of what is written
and said about their activity. This awareness is central to their high
sensitivity to Palestinian public opinion—perhaps even to Israeli public
opinion—not to mention to that of their own supporters, or what we may
call the Islamic public. It is typical of movements belonging to the school
of the Muslim Brotherhood that they constantly reevaluate their situation.
In the 12 years since the outbreak of the <i>Intifadah</i> Hamas has tended
to view its activity in stages. Every stage has its own strategy, goals
and tactics. In most cases they do not conceal their reasoning and reevaluations,
but publish it publicity in their main organ, <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>,
and some of their pamphlets.
<p>During the past two years we can see several reevaluations of the Palestinian
scene on one hand and of its activity on the other, made by the Hamas leadership
in the Territories. The analysis of these reevaluations has been presented
on this website in three different articles by the author—“<a href="reevaluation.htm">Is
Hamas Reevaluating the Use of Terrorism?</a>” on September 28<sup>th</sup>
1998; “<a href="new_hamas.htm">A New Tactic of Hamas Terrorism</a>” on
October 13<sup>th</sup> 1998; and “<a href="yassin_kanossa.htm">Is Yassin
Going to Kanossa?</a>” on May 7<sup>th</sup> 1999. The main consequence
of this analysis has been the thesis that Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his closest
aides in Gaza have thoroughly reconciled themselves to the existence of
the Palestinian Authority as a kind of Palestinian regime in a semi-independent
state. This change has come about since the Yassin’s release and his return
to the leadership of the movement in the Gaza Strip, in October of 1997.
<p>It seems that Yassin’s return to power has brought about two important
changes in Hamas. One of these changes stems from Yassin’s position as
the last prominent figure of the old leadership of the Palestinian Muslim
Brotherhood. As such he has brought Hamas to abide by the movement’s principles
and doctrines, without loosing sight of the enormous political importance
of the social, cultural and Islamic welfare activities. The second change
was Yassin’s success in taking over the authority and influence of the
“external” leadership, based mainly in Amman. These external leaders had
placed greater emphasis on the military side of the struggle—concentrating
mainly in the struggle against Israel rather than on gaining the local
support of the Palestinian society in the Territories. The expulsion from
Jordan of the Hamas activists by the Jordanian government has further weakened
their position vis-a-vis the “internal” leadership under Yassin, and has
thus strengthened his position. In fact, although he was obliged to publicly
condemn the Jordanian act, we have not seen any real activity of Hamas
in the Palestinian Authority to protest against this act. It seems that
Yassin and his followers in the Territories can now function more easily,
without feeling the external leadership breathing down their necks.
<p><b>A new course?</b>
<br>In the December 1999 issue of the London-based <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>,
an important unsigned article appeared concerning “The Development of the
Influence and Activity of the Islamic Trend in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in the last two years.” As in previous cases concerning such movements,
an unsigned article means that it reflects the official position of the
movement and not the views of someone within the movement. For this reason
the content of such articles is all the more important in analyzing the
changes in the movement and its strategy.
<p>The first thing that should attract our attention in the article is
the connection made between the military and political activity of Hamas.
The article compares the terrorist operations during the past two years
with the success of the Islamic Blocks in the student council elections
in the Palestinian universities over the past three years. This combination
is important because it seems that the article is mostly directed to the
movement’s supporters and the Islamic public.
<p>The manner in which the data is presented in the article gives the reader
the impression that the terrorist activity of the “Islamic Resistance”
in the past two years was meant primarily to affect Palestinian public
opinion and to increase the Palestinian support of the movement, rather
than to halt the peace process or to intimidate the Israeli public. Some
may say that this was a consequence of the Movement’s weakness following
heavy pressure brought to bear by the Israeli and Palestinian security
forces. Some may say that the strategy of Hamas has not changed, but that
it can no longer maintain its terrorism in Israel. But the fact is that
several of the movement’s publications since the release of Yassin two
years ago point to the conclusion that the local leadership is concentrating
more on the future than on waging a war against the “rear guard” of the
present political process. It seems that Hamas has fully internalized the
fact that the Palestinian independent state on part of Palestine as a consequence
of the reconciliation process with Israel is about to become a reality.
Moreover, it has internalized the fact that this is the expectation of
the vast majority of the Palestinians. The movement’s main direction of
struggle should therefore take place in the internal arena and center around
the nature of this future state.
<p><b>The popular support for Hamas</b>
<p>The essence of the Hamas self-analysis is the contribution of the terrorist
activity to the increased support of the Movement among the students, which
in their view reflects the support in the Palestinian public in general.
This is the important thing, not to the cessation of the peace process
with Israel. The fact is that during the last three elections in the prominent
universities Hamas gained the support of two thirds of the students. Since
it is hard to argue with facts, we should pay attention to the enormous
rates of support for Hamas among Palestinian students and ask the reasons
of this phenomenon. Even though this support among the students do not
necessarily reflect the support for the movement in the general Palestinian
public, as Hamas proudly indicates in the article, it is no doubt significant
for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>
Palestinian society in the Territories is very young, especially the Muslim
population. The same holds true for the population in the Gaza Strip, which
is all Muslim. The students are therefore the leading social and political
element in the younger generations.</li>

<li>
The social revolution in the Territories and the development of higher
education under Israeli rule have brought about a very high level of political
awareness in Palestinian youngsters, which leaves no place for political
vacuum. Most of the Palestinian students come from the middle and lower
classes, and many of them are villagers or residents of refugee camps.
Their integration in the new Palelite in the future, a process that began
in the 1980s gives them an important role in the shaping of the future
Palestinian State.</li>

<li>
The Palestinian Authority is relatively democratic, although there are
lot of complaints about corruption and Arafat’s dictatorship. The influence
of Israeli society and politics upon the Palestinians has brought about
a relatively pluralistic society in the Palestinian Authority, and a relative
highly-developed public opinion, much higher than in most of the Arab World.
The student element in that pluralism is very important.</li>

<li>
The student blocks in Palestinian universities are closer to political
parties than in any other sector, and maintain daily activity. Moreover,
the elections for the students’ councils are held each year, so they can
be used as a good criterion for the political diversity of the younger
generation.</li>

<li>
The number of students in various institutions of higher education—universities,
small colleges, Islamic colleges, various professional institutes, etc.—is
continually increasing. In 1999 there were about 22,000 students in the
Palestinian universities and about 8,000 in various other institutions
of higher education. This means that the students are about 1.5% of the
Palestinian population in the Palestinian Authority, a relatively high
fraction in the Arab World and not far from that in Israel (about 1.8%).</li>

<li>
Just as the Palestinian students played in the important role the 1980s
in the <i>Intifadah</i>, they are going to play a significant role in the
development of the future Palestinian State and society.</li>
</ul>
The Palestinian students, due to their youthful tendency to be more revolutionary,
as well as the role of the universities in the struggle against Israeli
occupation, tend more toward extremism. This explains the enormous support
for Hamas in the elections in the past few years. This phenomenon is not
new as Hamas or the Islamic Blocks of the Muslim Brothers have often won
elections in the universities. But, in the past this was under Israeli
rule and under the influence of the struggle against Israeli occupation,
with the PLO being outside of Palestine. In recent years the elections
were held under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has the
means to influence their results from near at hand. Therefore, the significance
of the Islamic achievements in these elections is greater.
<p><b>Terrorist tactics</b>
<br>Hamas has not ceased to be a terrorist organization and probably does
not intend to neglect that part of its activity. But, it is interesting
to look at the list of terrorist operations in the past two years, as shown
in the following translation of the article in <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>.
First, it should be noted that there is one double operation missing from
the list—the two car explosions in Haifa and Tiberias on September 1<sup>st</sup>
1999, which were carried out by Israeli Muslim citizens. Normally, Hamas
would be proud of these two operations, although they failed to cause casualties
(only one wounded in Tiberias). The fact that they were excluded from the
list may hint at the wish of the Hamas leadership to emphasize operations
carried out by Palestinians from the Territories, as it was for this audience
that the article was written.
<p>The list of terrorist operations published in the article (Table No.
1) includes 30 operations, 14 in the period between September 1997 to August
1998, and 16 between September 1998 to September 1999. Although we’re dealing
with relatively small numbers, the comparison of the data for each year
shows a very definite change. In the first period Hamas carried out 9 (out
of 14) operations using explosives (Suicide bombing, bombs and car bombs),
while in the second period only 5 out of 16 used this <i>modus operandi</i>.
Furthermore, in the first period Hamas carried out 5 out of 14 operations
using small arms (Shooting, grenades or Molotovs, stabbing and auto collisions),
while in the second 11 out of 16 operations used such methods. This means
that the terrorist apparatus is having difficulties obtaining and using
explosives, probably due to the greater effectiveness of both the Israeli
and Palestinian security forces, and the better cooperation between them.
<p>But, another interesting change can be seen in the locales and targets
of Hamas’ terrorism. In the first period 9 out of 14 operations were carried
out in Israel, including East-Jerusalem (4 out of the 9 outside Jerusalem).
In the second period 6 out of 16 were such operations (only 3 outside Jerusalem).
In other words, there is a decline in the operations carried out in Israel
(inside the “Green Line”) and an increase (from 5 to 9) of the operations
carried out in the Territories, against Israeli soldiers or settlers, who
are perceived by Hamas as soldiers as well.
<p>The question is whether this change reflects merely the scarcity of
explosives, or an overall change in tactics, or both. It is difficult to
answer this question in a decisive way. But, if we look at Hamas’ pamphlets
over the past year and some of the articles in <i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>,
we can at least mark a greater emphasis on the internal competition with
the Palestinian Authority than on the armed struggle against Israel. Hamas
has not changed its verbal war against the Jewish State nor its Jihad-like
language. But, it seems that some of the changes on the political scene
have brought about a reevaluation of the tactics of Hamas, at least in
the present and near future. Such political influences include the renewal
of the Israeli-Palestinian talks, the election of a new government in Israel,
the higher expectations within the Palestinian society, the pressures on
Hamas’ activity in Jordan, and the departure of some Palestinian leftist
factions like the PFLP and PDFLP from the “Opposition Front.”

of the Islamic Trend in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Last Two Years”&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><i>Filastin al-Muslimah</i>, December 1999.</b></center>

<p>The absence of the suicide operations that marked the activity of the
armed Islamic resistance in the period of 1994-1997, has brought with it
the assumption that there were signs of retreat caused by the circumstances,
which led the resistance to abandon its flags and weapons. This assumption
has been reinforced by the media and was nourished by the elements of the
compromising camp.&nbsp;
<p>In the shadow of stormy propaganda, accompanied by a noisy drumming
on the drums of reconciliation, the resistance and those who believed in
it have been viewed as a thing of the past. But, if we sift the dust of
propaganda and stick to the facts, we see that the reconciliation is eating
from the bread of history while the caravan of resistance is moving onwards
to the future. This is revealed if we seriously analyze the results of
the students’ elections, which precisely reflect the direction of the popular
current that is concealed by the Palestinian Authority and the powers of
dictatorship. These are the same consequences when we survey the resistance
activity by the rifle that refuses to be broken, despite the poisoned winds
over the area in this aching moment of its history.
<p><b>A. The resistance activity against occupation</b>
<br>The Palestinian scene has witnessed during the last months a real escalation
of the Jihad operations carried out by Hamas. It seems that those operations
have contradicted the rumors that the movement had changed its strategy
of Jihad and abandoned the alternative of the resistance, under the pressures
of persecution and arrests of its activists and members, both on the political
and military levels.
<p>The movement has proven its capability to reconstruct and promote itself
by more powerful means than in any period in the past, after every blow
directed at its military apparatus, either by the Israeli occupation or
the Palestinian National Authority. This was proven by the latest series
of operations, which kindled the red lights in the Israeli security system,
and pushed it to raise the level of alertness among its ranks, to besiege
some of the Palestinian cities, and to put mopressure on the Palestinian
Authority in order to increase its efforts in persecuting the activists
of the resistance in its territory.
<p>It should be noted that there was not only an escalation of the military
operations and increase of the activity of the military cells, but a development
in the organizational level of Hamas and the capability of taking new and
diverse measures, of maneuvering and of succeeding to carry out most of
the operations without any losses.&nbsp;

<b>B. The popular support in the leading universities.</b>
<br>The Palestinian universities can be viewed as microcosms reflecting
the tendencies of the Palestinian public opinion or at least its vast majority.
The Palestinian universities are an extension of the Palestinian environment
that faces the reality of the occupation and the peace agreements. Therefore,
they can be viewed as an important criterion of this reality.&nbsp;
<p>The Palestinian universities, like the rest of the universities in the
world, are a reflection of the political and social components in society.
The students are biased to various political currents. Moreover, the messages
of the political parties and movements reach the university campuses through
the students. Therefore, every studential move is a political position
but from a university point of view. The elections for the students’ councils
in the Palestinian universities are a balance, and the political trends
in the universities are similar to the natural trends in the Palestinian
public. The positions of the students and their voting are therefore means
to the reading of the tendencies of the Palestinian public and its various
currents.&nbsp;
<p>Here are, for example, the results of the elections in some of the universities.&nbsp;
<p><b>Al-Najah University</b>
<p>In 1996 the number of voters was 8166.
<br>In 1997 the number of voters was 9557 out of 9729 students, about 80.6%
<br>In 1998 the number of voters was 8140 out of 10,080 students, about
80.8%
<br>In 1999 the number of voters was 8318 out of 10,407 students, about
80.4%
<br>The council is composed from 81 seats.&nbsp;

<p><br>* The Democratic Polar is a front of the Popular Front, the People’s
Party, FIDA, the Struggle Front and the Communist Party, in the elections
of 1999. It represented the leftist trend.&nbsp;
<p>Al-Najah National University in Nablus is the largest Palestinian university
and the most famous in the history of the Palestinian struggle. Therefore,
you cannot ignore the political, social and cultural elements of the student
movement inside and outside the campuses, with the Israeli occupation in
the past or the Palestinian National Authority, in the present.
<p>If we survey the history of the Palestinian student movement in the
last two decades, we notice the absence of the Islamic trend in the 1970s
and 1980s from the general Islamic arena, while the PLO was the dominant
element in Al-Najah University and a fruitage factor for its supporting
trend—Fath. The Shabibah movement had had a dominance over the student
council’s seats, until it was defeated for the first time since the outbreak
of the <i>Intifadah</i>, and the Islamic block succeeded in gaining the
confidence of the majority of the university students and hence, the control
of the council. Only then, the power balance has changed.&nbsp;
<p>As we see in Table no. 3, Hamas has increased its votes in about 2.7%
between 1996 and 1999 and succeeded in crossing the barrier of majority,
which enabled it to control the council with no need of the other factions.
It seems that the popularity of Fath has retreated versus the increase
of the Islamic trend of Hamas. The increase in the support for Hamas means
that there is a real change in the tendencies of the students and their
affiliations, after a long period in which they supported Fath. The increase
of the rate of the voters should be noticed too, as it reached in 1998
and 1999 more than 80% from the total number of the students, which exceeds
10,000.&nbsp;
<p>The election of 1999 was a kind of referendum on the peace process between
Israel and the Palestinians, between Hamas as the trend of resistance to
the Israeli occupation and Fath and the march of reconciliation supported
by the Palestinian National Authority.&nbsp;
<p>Several days prior to the elections there was wave of arrests of Hamas
students in the university, in order to assist Fath. But the result was
the victory of the Filastin al-Muslimah block in most of the council’s
seats for the second year, in spite of the oppression and threats of the
Palestinian Authority against Hamas members and supporters, and the assistto
Fath.&nbsp;
<p>The progress of Hamas in the elections was firstly at the expense of
the Palestinian left and secondly the traditional dominance of Fath.&nbsp;
<p><b>The Islamic University of Gaza</b>
<p>In 1996 the number of voters was 2635 out of 3629 students, about 73%
<p>In 1999 the number of voters was 2482 out of 4029 students, about 62%
<p>The council is composed from 9 seats.&nbsp;

<p><br>From Table no. 4 we can see that Hamas controlled all the 9 seats
in the Islamic University in Gaza, its traditional center, where it has
been developed before it expanded to the rest of Palestine. Despite the
fact that Gaza Strip was the first area of control of the Palestinian National
Authority and returned to Palestinian hands according to the peace process,
the political trend supporting this reality has failed to win even one
seat of the student council under the banner of Fath. It may be explained
by the bad political and economic conditions in Gaza since the Oslo Accord,
which are much worse than in any other Palestinian area or city. The lower
classes suffer there from poverty and unemployment, while according to
the report of the Palestinian Parliament, enormous sums of money from the
Palestinian budget went to the purchase of tens of vehicles for Palestinian
officials. Not to mention the political situation that was revealed in
the reports of organizations of human rights about the political detainees
in Palestinian jails and the beatings and humiliation they are exposed
to, due to their political opposition tendencies.&nbsp;
<p><b>Bir Zeit University</b>
<p>In 1996 the number of voters was 2366 out of 2986 students, about 78%
<br>In 1997 the number of voters was 2596 out of 3070 students, about 84.6%
<br>In 1998 the number of voters was 2771 out of 3259 students, about 85%

<p><br>The elections in Bir Zeit University were marked by many changes
in the results of all blocks. The Islamic trend has been developing and
maintained relative equality with Fath. The achievement of the Islamic
trend in this university is remarkable due to the importance of the institution
and its weight in the Palestinian public and society. The students at Bir
Zeit have high political awareness and a tendency to absorb ideologies
and ideas of different kinds.&nbsp;
<p><b>Hebron University</b>
<p>The number of seats in the student council in 1997 was 35, and 41 in
1998.
<p>Hebron University has witnessed the dominance of the Islamic Trend,
composed of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, in the first elections under the Palestinian
Authority. This success was at the expense of Fath and the leftist trends.
The Islamic trend won in 1997, 19 out of 35 seats, with 54.3% of the votes.
In 1998 and 1999, it won, under the banner of Filastin al-Muslimah, 22
out of 41 seats, with 53.7% of the votes.&nbsp;
<p>Fath movement won in 1997, 15 seats with 42.9%, retreated in 1998 to
17 seats out of 41, but succeeded in 1999 in gaining 19 seats. Among the
other blocks only the Taghyir (Change) Block gained in 1998 two seats,
and all the others have totally failed.&nbsp;
