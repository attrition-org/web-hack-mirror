<p><center><h2>The Arabs in Israel:
<br><i>Defending Al-Aqsa or Fighting for Equality?</I></h2></center>
<P><b>Reuven Paz</b>
<BR><b>ICT Academic Director</b>
<P><font size="-1">This article was previously published in Peace Watch, the Washington
Institute's Special Reports on the Arab-Israeli Peace Process, Number 281,
October 3, 2000.</font>

<p><p>The riots and violent demonstrations of Israeli Arab citizens in the
last few days have been the most violent in 18 years and can be compared
only to the violent protests that occurred in response to the massacres
in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilah by Christian Phalanges
in September 1982. Israeli Arabs did not give vent to such violence and
rage even during the Palestinian Uprising (Intifadah) in the Territories.
Although most of the Israeli Arab citizens have not taken part in the current
violence, it seems from their reactions that most of them든specially the
Muslim population들dentify with the expressions of rage (Christian, Northern
Bedouin, and Druze villages took no part in the latest incidents).
<p>The current uprising has been named the Al-Aqsa Intifadah, a phrase
coined by Knesset Member Dr. Ahmad Tibi. The phrase implies that the rage
that led to the violent events was a direct consequence of the "danger
to the fate of Al-Aqsa." October 1st has been declared "Al-Aqsa Day," and
is supposed to be commemorated in the coming years, perhaps as an alternative
to "Land Day," which has lost its appeal to most of the Arab population.
<p><b>An escalation on several fronts</b>
<br>The events, which came as a complete surprise in terms of both scope
and intensity, stunned Israeli Jews. Unprecedented, Israeli towns and villages
were closed and under siege for several days, while main transportation
arteries were blocked. There were at least three cases of shooting at Israeli
vehicles. Eight Israeli Arab citizens were killed by the Israeli police.
<p>The Arab leadership, including members of Knesset, made extreme statements,
comparing the Israeli police to Nazis and calling the Israeli government
the enemy. They did nothing to stop or to calm the rioters. Voices calling
for co-existence, in the past the slogan of the Communist Party and many
Arabs, totally disappeared.
<p>For the first time, demonstrations within Israel occurred in tandem
with those within the Palestinian Authority, whose police, security forces,
and Fatah's military infrastructure (Tanzim), were prominent in the violent
events in the Territories. It seemed as if the "Green Line" between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority듡ormerly strictly adhered to by the Israeli
Arabs듰anished entirely. Furthermore, the extreme faction of the Islamic
Movement in Israel was revealed as the primary political power among Israeli
Arabs, despite the fact that its closest Palestinian counterpart듇amas듮ook
no part in organized events in the Territories.
<p><b>Causes of violence in Israel</b>
<br>In addition to the issue of Al-Aqsa, which has in recent years become
the most prominent issue raised by the Israeli Islamic Movement, there
are three main reasons for the present outbreak and its intensity:
<ul>
<li>
The sense of confrontation in the wake of the arrest of tens of Israeli
Arabs suspected of terrorism in the last year. The statements of Israeli
officials, mainly high-ranking police officers have also played a role.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The notion among the Palestinians in general드nd reinforced by the Israeli
withdrawal from Southern Lebanon듮hat the Israeli government and the Israeli
public cannot confront popular force and violence.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The belief among Israeli Arabs that the expected final-status Israeli-Palestinian
agreement leaves them with no improvements to their own situation.</li>
</ul>
It should also be noted that following the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon,
Israeli Arabs took part in public expressions of enthusiasm over the "victory
of Hizballah." They participated in the ritual of visiting the Israeli-Lebanese
border, where they met Palestinian refugee relatives, and in some cases,
encouraged the throwing of stones and other objects from the Lebanese side
at Israeli soldiers. The effects of the "Lebanese victory" and the calls
for "Lebanonization" of the Palestinian struggle in the Territories must
have influenced the Israeli Arabs too.
<p>No doubt all these factors played a role. However the religious element
cannot be ignored. The violence in recent years has tended to center in
Umm al-Fahm, the "capital" of the Islamic Movement. The main areas of confrontation
with the police in the first two days were the towns and villages in the
northern part of the "Triangle" and the Galilee듫laces where the Islamic
Movement is most influential. The flags raised in the demonstrations were
the green flags of the Islamic Movement. Later on the
<br>riots spread to other places and Palestinian national flags began being
raised as well.
<p>The leadership of the extremist party of the Islamic Movement has in
the past decade succeeded in instilling in the Israeli Muslims the importance
of Jerusalem in general and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in particular, as the symbol
of their national aspirations. Furthermore, protecting the sanctity of
the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which Islamists claim Jewish extremists wish to convert
into a synagogue, has become more important.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The visit by Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon and other Likud
Knesset members to the area of the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Thursday September
28th was used by the Palestinian Authority as a trigger for rioting the
next day. This event influenced Israeli Muslims as well. Sharon was immediately
linked by Israeli Arab leaders and demonstrators to the massacre at Sabra
and Shatilah, exactly 18 years ago.
<p>The Israeli Arabs, mainly in Umm al-Fahm and the Galilee, found another
"enemy" in the form of Northern District police chief, Alik Ron. In the
past weeks, Ron publicly and bluntly warned of incitement to and the escalation
of violence among Israeli Arabs. Ron's words were met with extreme and
verbally violent reactions from Arab leaders. Sharon as the "enemy of the
Palestinians," and Ron as "the enemy of the Israeli Arabs," were used by
Israeli Arab leaders to symbolize allegations of discrimination and police
brutality against the Arab population in Israel.
<p>Surprisingly, Israeli Arab leaders and demonstrators have only rarely
denounced Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak - an omission that is all the
more noticeable given recent events. Moreover, it seems that the Arab leadership
has made some efforts to keep the events under control, and expressed their
immediate willingness to meet with Israeli officials. Israeli Arab leaders
generally welcomed moderate statements made by Israeli government officials.
<p><b>A shift in political focus</b>
<br>A significant change has occurred in recent years in the Israeli Arab
leadership that may have influenced recent events. Unlike the 1970s and
the 1980s, when the Israeli Arab leadership was composed primarily of mayors
and local municipal leaders, the present center of mass of the Arab leadership
is in the Knesset. Most of the present Arab Knesset members come, not from
the municipal sector, but from the field of political activism. Their priorities
are not necessarily budgets and development projects but in unifying the
Arab minority on Palestinian national interests.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>Of crucial importance for the future of the delicate relationship between
Arabs and Jews in Israel is the question of the motivations of Arab violence.
Is the main issue one of nationalism and religion, or is it the basic struggle
for equality, characteristic of Arab political activity for so many years?
<p>From the statements of secular Arab leaders든ven in the last few days듮his
main focus is still on equality. The change, which is significant, is the
notion that the use of force and violence is now a primary means of achieving
this goal. The reactions among Israeli Jews to these events have been mixed.
On one hand, there is anger and expressions of hostility. On the other
hand, there is a greater understanding of the social causes that feed this
violence, and a willingness to allocate resources to the Israeli Arabs
<br>for the improvement of their situation.
<p>However, the violent events have established new "red lines" between
the Israeli Arabs and the Israeli government and society. Jerusalem and
Al-Aqsa have become symbols for Palestinian nationalism on both sides of
the "Green Line," and the Islamic Movement in Israel has made another step
in instilling the religious Islamic element in the Israeli Arab struggle.
This may lead to an increase in the participation of Israeli Muslims in
terrorist activity in the coming years드n increase that began in the
past decade, primarily among members of the Islamic Movement.
