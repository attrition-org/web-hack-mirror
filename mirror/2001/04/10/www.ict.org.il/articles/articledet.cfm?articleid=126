<p><p><img SRC="../graphics/libya_w.gif" height=145 width=170 align=RIGHT>On April 23, 2000 a small band of Abu Sayyaf militants raided the divers’
resort on Sipadan Island off Malaysian Borneo. In a lightning raid they
nabbed 21 tourists and resort workers and took them at gunpoint back to
their hideout on Jolo Island, a trip of just over an hour by boat.
<p>While kidnapping foreigners is not unusual for Abu Sayyaf, taking them
on foreign soil is. The Sipadan island raid was the first known international
venture by Abu Sayyaf—an organization that has turned kidnappings of local
businessmen and Christian missionaries into a thriving cottage industry
in the depressed, mainly Muslim islands of the southern Philippines. The
kidnappings provided work, in the form of guard duty, message-running and
liaison, for the unemployed and desperately poor inhabitants of the islands.
<p>Generally the government would pay “board and lodging” expenses—a euphemism
for ransoms—to the kidnappers to redeem the hapless victims. Government
officials tended to deny the payment of ransom, saying that the money came
from private individuals. However, ransom was often filtered through government
negotiators, sometimes with the negotiators cutting themselves into the
deal. The government rarely mounted an intensive offensive against the
kidnappers once the hostages were free.
<p>During the first week of June, Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Sabaya said
that his group was demanding one million dollars for each of the Western
hostages held on Jolo. Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon later
said that Manila would not stop foreign governments from paying ransoms.
<p>Then, on August 7, Philippine Armed forces chief General Angelo Reyes
confirmed that Abu Sayyaf has raked in 245 million pesos ($5.5 million)
in ransoms. According to Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado most of the
money was going to buy weapons.[Manila Times, 7/8/00]
<p>At the beginning of August Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora admitted
the money had come from foreign governments who forked over enormous sums
in ransom for the hostages. However he did not identify which governments,
agencies or individuals had paid the guerrillas. These payments, he said,
were made without the consent of the Philippine government, which has a
no-ransom policy. “Even if we say no or explain that our government’s policy
is not to pay ransom, when the time comes they find a way to pay.” [AP,
8/8/00].
<p><b><font face="Arial">Shopping spree</font></b>
<p>With the ransom payments that Abu Sayyaf has already raked in—payments
said to amount to $5 million (about P225 million), the group now has the
funds to arm and equip a small army. According to sources quoted by the
<i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i>, a large portion of the loot has already
gone to purchase the loyalty of villagers and arm them, to buy a speedboat
and 10 motorcycles. Reuters quoted police sources on Jolo as saying that
Abu Sayyaf has paid 50,000 pesos (about $1,100) to each of some 2,500 followers,
many of whom are new recruits. Most of them have also been given new weapons.
<p>Police intelligence sources on Jolo were quoted by the <i>Philippine
Daily Inquirer</i> on 16 August as saying that some $5.47 million had already
been distributed among 13 Abu Sayyaf chieftains. The paper reported that
Galib Andang, alias Commander Robot, chief of the hostage-takers and Mujib
Susukan, with a combined strength of 880 men, received the lion’s share
of the loot, some P201-million. Two other Abu Sayyaf leaders, Abu Pula
Jumdail and Nadzmi Sahadulla, alias Commander Global, who have a combined
force of 600 followers, each received P5 million, according to the report.
Journalists visiting the rebel camp have reported seeing Galib Andang test-firing
a batch of gleaming new Uzi sub-machine guns.
<p>High currency notes are suddenly common in the markets of Jolo, while
Abu Sayyaf’s arms-buying spree has driven up the prices of weapons in Mindanao.
Prices for mortars, light machineguns, recoilless rifles, M-14s, M-16s
and even old Garand single shot rifles have suddenly jumped.
<p>Intelligence sources quoted in the Philippines media said that the kidnappers
have also built up an inventory of some 3,000 home-made landmines which
they would presumably deploy to deter any government assault once the hostage
crisis is resolved.
<p><b><font face="Arial">2000 new recruits</font></b>
<p>However the increase in the group’s fortunes are nothing compared to
the increase in it prestige. A group such as Abu Sayyaf requires the complicity—even
if passive—of the surrounding population in order to function. Prior to
the Sipadan hostage-taking Abu Sayyaf’s popularity was not high. After
years of setbacks at the hands of the security forces, Abu Sayyaf had degenerated
into a small band of less than 200 armed militants and some 600
followers. In the eyes of moderate Moros, the group was seen as little
more than a band of armed bandits, who gave Islam a bad name by their brutal
attacks on Christians and their indiscriminate bombings. The kidnapping
of nearly 50 schoolchildren in Basilan in March did not help this image.
<p>Now, after years of declining influence and resources, Abu Sayyaf has
reemerged as a force to be reckoned with. Not only has a small band of
militants succeeded in holding the Philippines government hostage to its
demands for four months, it has gone further than the government ever has
in benefiting the economy of the impoverished local population.
<p>In an interview with the Agence France-Press on 16 August, Wahab Akbar,
the provincial governor of Basilan Island expressed anxiety that with the
huge ransoms raised, the Abu Sayyaf could “mobilize across the region.”
The extreme poverty in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines is
driving more young people into the arms of Abu Sayyaf. “Jolo is too small
for them. They need expansion,” he said.
<p>Philippines military sources said that thousands have flocked to join
Abu Sayyaf since the kidnapping, lured by the huge ransoms the group has
squeezed out of foreign governments. Colonel Romeo Tolentino, commander
of a military task force in Jolo was quoted by AFP as saying that Abu Sayyaf
ranks have swelled at least ten-fold to 3,000 since the start of the hostage
crisis in April and recruitment was continuing. Filipino intelligence sources
claimed that local armed groups had offered their services to Abu Sayyaf,
for salaries of from 40,000 to 100,000 pesos ($889-2,222) for the armed
guards for the hostages.
<p><b><font face="Arial">What next?</font></b>
<p>Abu Sayyaf’s decision to go international should spur the Philippines
government to invest far more of its resources into an offensive against
the group. Manila has vowed to go after Abu Sayyaf once the last of the
hostages are freed—with the police set to file criminal charges for kidnappings
and two military battalions set to assault the rebels’ Jolo hideouts. “We
will show them that kidnapping is a dangerous profession,” southern Philippines
military spokesman Colonel Hilario Atendido said.
<p>However, most experts agree that carrying out this threat will not be
easy. The Abu Sayyaf militants are fully aware of their vulnerability to
attack once their last Western hostage is released. They can be expected
to bank on the government’s concern for its image in the eyes of Western
governments until the last moment. What their strategy will be afterward
is still not known, although some sort of immunity would probably be a
central point in the negotiation. Some analysts assume that the Jolo band
will simply kidnap other foreign or Filipino hostages to serve as their
“insurance” against attacks by the Armed Forces and the police. An editorial
in the <i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i> said:
<blockquote>Having found kidnapping for ransom to be such a lucrative business,
they can be expected to continue engaging in it and to protect their business
and themselves. So, we should expect them to continue kidnapping foreigners,
and when they’ve run out of foreigners, wealthy Filipino businessmen and
high government officials and even media persons, to satisfy their insatiable
greed for money.</blockquote>
Thus, the author writes, the cycle will continue.
<p>Abu Sayyaf is a far more formidable enemy now that it was before the
kidnapping. The group’s fighters have gained exerience and a tremendous
lift in morale. They’ve already used their gains to purchase arms and explosives.
In addition they have a powerful ally working for them—the poverty of the
southern Philippines. With this one operation, Abu Sayyaf has become the
single biggest employer in the area. Jolo is one of the Philippines’ poorest
islands. With rampant unemployment, the group will have no shortage of
willing manpower to enlist in its war.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Libya courts world favor</font></font></i></b>
<p>As the Jolo Island hostage crisis finally seemed to be showing signs
of resolution, Libya, long an international pariah, emerged as the hero
of the hour. Libyan negotiators played a key role in the negotiations,
and will apparently be footing the bill for ransoming the hostages. In
what is undoubtedly one of the more bizarre, though undoubtedly clever
public relations operations in its history, Libya is not only openly supporting
a recognized terrorist organization but stands to garner international
kudos for doing so.
<p>Tripoli emerged as a major player when the Lebanese daily <i>al-Nahar</i>
on August 5 announced that Libya and agreed to pay the sum of $25 million
for the release of the foreign hostages being held by Abu Sayyaf. The paper
reported that Seif al-Islam, the son of Libyan leader Moammar Qaddafi sent
an emissary to Manila to try for a deal.
<p>The envoy, Mohamad Ismail, reportedly contacted the Lebanese Embassy
in Tokyo and expressed “full readiness” to pay $1 million for the release
of Marie Moarbes, a Lebanese-French woman. The report said Libya would
then pay $24 million for the liberation of the other hostages.
<p><b><font face="Arial">Past support for Philippine Muslim groups</font></b>
<p>Libya’s role as hostage negotiator is not new. For years, Libya has
mediated between the Philippine government and Muslim rebels fighting for
an Islamic state in the southern Philippines. As part of its policy of
outreach to Islamic groups around the world, Qaddafi’s government funded
schools and mosques in the impoverished Muslim regions.
<p>However, Libya’s role was not confined to providing humanitarian aide
to the region’s Muslims. Tripoli has also been accused of training rebels
from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has been fighting for years
for an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
<p>In 1976, Libya helped to forge an agreement between the Filipino government
and the Islamic MNLF. Known as the Tripoli Accord, the agreement led to
an autonomous Muslim region being established in the southern Philippines
twenty years later.
<p>One of the members of the Islamic panel that helped to hammer out the
Tripoli agreement was Dr. Rajab Azzarouq. Dr. Azzarouq, who served as Libya’a
ambassador to the Philippines between 1990 and 1999 currently heads the
Qaddafi International Association for Charitable Associations, which is
leading the negotiations for the release of the hostages on Jolo. He was
reportedly asked for by name by the Abu Sayyaf cell holding the hostages.
Dr Azzarouq acted in such a capacity many times throughout the Philippines’
long conflict.
<p><b><font face="Arial">Exacting a price</font></b>
<p>Throughout the negotiations, Dr. Azzarouq vigorously denied that Libya
was paying a ransom for the hostages. He said negotiators had persuaded
the rebels to free their captives in exchange for a Libyan pledge to fund
development projects in the poverty-stricken southern Philippines. “Our
offer, which we talked about, is a socio-economic package for livelihood
projects,” said Azzarouq. These projects would include schools, medical
clinics, and housing for one of the country’s poorest areas—an area ruled
in all but name, by Abu Sayyaf. Azzarouq said Libya was helping to free
the hostages purely for humanitarian reasons.
<p>However there are rumors that Libya may be reaping more concrete benefits.
According to the investigative newspaper <i>Le Canard Enchaine</i>, Qaddafi
made a deal for “political compensation” with France in return for his
country’s intermediary role in the Philippines hostage crisis. “France
had asked Libya to pay a ransom in its place,” the paper reported, as an
exchange for “helping Qaddafi’s Libya to return to the diplomatic fold.”
<p>According to <i>Le Canard Enchaine</i>, Yves Aubin de la Messuzi&egrave;re,
director of North African and Middle Eastern affairs at the French Foreign
Ministry visited Tripoli in early August to negotiate terms of Libya’s
help in the release of Sonia Wendling and St&eacute;phane Loisy. He was
allegedly authorized to say that this help would earn “a strong political
gesture.” The report claims that this gesture could take the form of a
French invitation to Qaddafi to join in a November summit in Marseilles,
along with French assistance in lifting U.N. sanctions against Libya.
<p>Regardless of whether France or any of the other countries whose nationals
are among the hostages have promised concrete rewards to Libya, the diplomatic
benefits to Qaddafi are clear. The ambassador of one of the affected countries
was quoted by the Associated Press as saying, “Libya in the past has been
linked to terrorism by America. This is their way of telling the world
that it is not a country that supports terrorism but in fact helps end
this kind of problem.”
<p>Qaddafi has been trying to forge a role as the godfather of the continent
since abandoning the Arab nationalist cause. In a bid for the leadership
of North Africa, Libya has been active in numerous attempts at conflict
resolution. In recent months Tripoli has contributed to ending the war
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and securing the release of kidnapped peacekeepers
in Sierra Leone.
<p>Aside from the conflicts in Sierra Leone, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Libya
has also tried to reconcile Somali warlords, end Sudan’s 17-year-old civil
war and forge peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where he
helped set up a brief cease-fire and sent peacekeeping troops last year.
<p>Now Qaddafi, who always had a flare for the dramatic has emerged into
the spotlight as a sponsor of humanitarian gestures and the freeing of
hostages. Commentators have been quick to point out the diplomatic rewards
that Qaddafi can expect to win. Qaddafi is nothing if not aware of the
importance of the media. He is playing up his country’s role in the negotiations
for all it is worth. The papers have been full of news on Libya’s contributions.
A special plane is even standing by to fly the released hostages to Tripoli
to meet with Qaddafi before they return home.
<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+1><b>Conclusion: </b>Business as usual</font></font></i>
<p>The Associated Press story on 18 August entitled “Gadhafi’s Bids to
Free Hostages” is typical of the reports in the media. “Now, with a bid
to negotiate the release of hostages being held halfway around the world
by rebels in the Philippines, he is trying to win himself a few moments
of glory and bury past links to terrorism and brutality,” says AP’s reporter.
The article quotes Jeremy Binnie, a North Africa expert for the Jane's
group of defense and analysis publications as saying, “He’s trying to end
Libya's isolation,” adding, “Whether he’s done a complete about-face is
doubtful.”
<p>What many seem to have missed however, is that in negotiating to free
the hostages— and particularly in offering to buy their freedom—Libya is
not engaging in any new policy. Tripoli can expect the acclaim of the whole
world for its role in bringing the crisis to a successful conclusion.
<p>However, of equal importance is Libya’s image in the eyes of Islamic
liberation movements. Just as Tripoli’s mediation in the Philippines conflict
in the past showed Libya as the main sponsor of the Filipino Moros, so
in the present situation Tripoli continues to invest in the Islamist movement
in the Philippines.
<p>Qaddafi knows that his country that will not only emerge as the hero
of the crisis but will be seen to have provided more for the development
of the Moro community of the Philippines than has the Philippine government.
This will certainly not hurt Libya’s capital with other Islamist movements.
<p>What is certain is that with the funds provided by Libya—whether earmarked
for “development projects” or paid in cash—Abu Sayyaf’s following in the
southern Philippines can be expected to grow. If the Libyan support does
take the form of social infrastructure projects then the group’s standing
will be enhanced even more than if it simply takes the money and runs.
The building of schools under Abu Sayyaf auspices will do as much to endear
it to the local populace as paying the wages of a few bodyguards.
<p>Jeremy Binnie, the Janes Defense expert quoted above pointed out that
Qaddafi could still be involved with fomenting unrest in places like Chad
and elsewhere in Africa. What isn’t being said is that in paying off the
Abu Sayyaf hostage-takers—in whatever form this payoff takes—Libya is already
involved in fomenting unrest in the Philippines.
<p>If the Libyan mediation succeeds Qaddafi will have accomplished the
seemingly impossible: he will have won the acclaim of Western governments
while openly funding a terrorist organization.
