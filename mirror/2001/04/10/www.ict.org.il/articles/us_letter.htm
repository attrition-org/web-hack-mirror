<P>Mr. Dani Naveh
<BR>Cabinet Secretary
<BR>Office of the Prime Minister
<BR>Jerusalem

<P>Dear Dani:

<P>I wanted to confirm our policy on the issues of Reciprocity/Parallelism,
Permanent Status Negotiations, and Prisoner Releases. In this regard, the
statements issued publicly by the State Department on October 29, 1998,
are accurate and represent our policies.

<P>On Reciprocity/Parallelism, the statement said: "resolving the crisis
of confidence between Israelis and Palestinians requires each side to fulfill
a set of responsibilities based on the concept of reciprocity. I.E., both
sides must carry out their respective obligations in accordance with the
Wye River Memorandum. These obligations will be implemented or carried
out in a parallel phased approach in accordance with the mutually agreed
Time Line."

<P>As for Permanent Status Negotiations, the statement said: "the U.S.
is highly sensitive to the vital importance of the permanent status issues
to Israel's future. We recognize that the security of the State of Israel
and the Israeli public is at stake, and the U.S. commitment to Israel's
security remains ironclad."

<P>"We appreciate that if the U.S. is invited by both parties to participate
in the permanent status talks, which are to be conducted between Israel
and the Palestinians on a bilateral basis, we will do so for the purpose
of facilitating the negotiations."

<P>"Only Israel can determine its own security needs and decide what solutions
will be satisfactory."

<P>"We also understand that any decision to convene or seek to convene
a summit to resolve permanent status issues will need the agreement of
both parties."

<P>With regard to the issue of prison releases and the question of a "revolving
door", the statement said: "we have had discussions with the Palestinians
and they have given us a firm commitment that there will be no 'revolving
door'."

<P>These public statements by the State Department represent our policies.
We will not change them and they will remain our policies in the future.

<P>Mr. Dani Naveh
<BR>Cabinet Secretary
<BR>Government of Israel

<P>Dear Mr. Naveh:

<P>I wanted to provide further clarification of the understanding of the
United States regarding one of the issues addressed in the "Wye River Memorandum."

<P>With respect to the Palestinian side's provision of its list of policemen
to Israel (II(C)(1)(a)), the U.S. has been assured that it will receive
all appropriate information concerning current and former policemen as
part of our assistance program. It is also our understanding that it was
agreed by the two sides that the total number of Palestinian policemen
would not exceed 30,000.

<P>Mr. Dani Naveh
<BR>Cabinet Secretary
<BR>Office of the Prime Minister
<BR>Jerusalem

<P>Dear Dani:

<P>I wanted to confirm our policy on the issue of the 3rd phase of further
redeployment. In this regard, the statement issued publicly by the State
Department on October 27, 1998, is accurate and represents our policy.

<P>Regarding the third further redeployment, the statement said: "during
the discussions leading to this agreement, the U.S. made clear to both
parties that it will not adopt any position or express any view about the
size or the content of the third phase of Israel's further redeployment,
which is an Israeli responsibility to implement rather than negotiate."

<P>"Under the terms of the memorandum, an Israeli-Palestinian committee
is being established. Nonetheless we urge the parties not to be distracted
from the urgent task of negotiating permanent status arrangements, which
are at the heart of the matter and which will determine the future of the
area."

<P>"Our own efforts have been and will continue to be dedicated to that
vital task."

<P>This public statement by the State Department represents our policy.
We will not change it and it will remain our policy in the future.

<P>Mr. Dani Naveh
<BR>Cabinet Secretary
<BR>Office of the Prime Minister
<BR>Jerusalem

<P>Dear Dani:

<P>I wanted to confirm our policy on the issues of unilateral actions and
the Charter of the PLO. In this regard, the statements issued publicly
by the State Department on October 27, 1998, are accurate and represent
our policies.

<P>With regard to unilateral declarations or other unilateral actions,
the statement said: "as regards to the possibility of a unilateral decision
of statehood or other unilateral actions by either party outside the negotiating
process that prejudge or predetermine the outcome of those negotiations,
the U.S. opposes and will oppose any such unilateral actions."

<P>"Indeed, the U.S. has maintained for many years that an acceptable solution
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be found through negotiations,
not through unilateral actions. And as we look to the future, that will
remain our policy."

<P>"For the present, we are doing all we can to promote permanent status
negotiations on an accelerated basis. And we are stressing that those who
believe that they can declare unilateral positions or take unilateral acts,
when the interim period ends, are courting disaster."

<P>With regard to the PNC, the statement said: "the Wye River Agreement
specifies that the members of the PNC (as well as the members of the PLO
Central Council, the Palestinian Council and the Heads of Palestinian Ministries)
will be invited to a meeting which President Clinton will attend."

<P>"The purpose of this meeting of the PNC and other PLO organizations
is to reaffirm Chairman Arafat's January 22 letter to President Clinton
nullifying each of the Charter's provisions that are inconsistent with
the PLO's commitments to renounce terror, and to recognize and live in
peace with Israel."

<P>"This process of reaffirmation will make clear, once and for all, that
the provisions of the PLO Charter that call for the destruction of Israel
are null and void."

<P>These public statements by the State Department represent our policies.
We will not change them and they will remain our policies in the future.
