<P>The ISI has possibly
helped Osama bin Laden and his Arab and Afghan supporters escape action
against them by the US by creating a sanctuary for them in Indian territory,
by taking advantage of the absence of the Indian army from the Kargil-Drass
areas during winter.
<p>Certain advantages from the national security point of view, which the
Rajiv Gandhi Government had secured for India in the Siachen sector, have
been allowed to be neutralised, partly if not fully, by the ISI-supported
intrusion of around 300 to 400 mercenaries into Indian territory in the
Kargil sector and the ISI's apparent creation of a special sanctuary for
the mercenaries on the ridges from which they could, by their potential
ability to disrupt traffic on the Srinagar-Leh road, keep large numbers
of Indian troops bottled up in this area to protect the road.
<p>That seems to be the ominous significance of the developments in Kargil
since the beginning of this month. The Government's embarrassed silence
on this subject has been projected as calculated silence to avoid raising
the temperature and falling into any Pakistani trap to create an international
alarm over a possible new conflict between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir
issue.
<p>That is a very valid reason. At the same time, the silence is also possibly
motivated by concerns over the electoral consequences of the Kargil developments.&nbsp;
<p>The BJP had always been projecting itself as having a better understanding
of national security issues than any other party and the Government led
by it had been bragging about its success in restoring normalcy in Kashmir,
despite the fact that the credit for effectively dealing with Pakistan's
proxy war in Kashmir should go to the Narasimha Rao Government. It had
also been boasting about its initiative in giving a new direction to Indo-Pakistan
relations.
<p>If the intrusion in the Kargil sector is not effectively eliminated
in the coming weeks, it could seriously hurt the credibility of the Government
and the BJP. Consequent popular perceptions that the Government, in its
naivete, had let itself be taken for a ride by the Nawaz Sharif Government,
and had, despite all its bombasts, failed to protect our territorial integrity,
could turn the tide of electoral opinion against the party.
<p>Analysts in New Delhi, official as well as non-official, have given
various reasons, all plausible, for the Pakistani action in helping the
mercenaries intrude into Indian territory and entrench themselves on the
ridges:
<li type="square">
To revive the insurgency in Kashmir.</li>

<li type="square">
To force the Indian army to divert troops from the Valley to protect the
road to Leh.&nbsp;</li>

<li type="square">
To divert attention from the Valley to help the infiltration of fresh mercenaries
into the Valley.</li>

<li type="square">
To bring the issue back on the international agenda by creating fears of
a fresh Kosovo.</li>

<p><br>There is another plausible reason, which needs careful examination,
though, at present, there is no concrete evidence in support of this. The
ISI has possibly helped Osama bin Laden and his Arab and Afghan supporters
escape action against them by the US by creating a sanctuary for them in
Indian territory, by taking advantage of the absence of the Indian army
from this territory during winter.
<p>Faced with the threat of fresh bombings by the US on their sanctuaries
in Afghanistan, bin Laden and his followers had disappeared from the Kandahar
area of Afghanistan in February. Since then, there had been speculation
regarding their present whereabouts.
<p>While the US had been insisting that they were still hiding in Afghan
territory, unofficial reports had been speculating that they had either
escaped to Iraq or Chechnya or were hiding in the Federally-Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan.
<p>The Nawaz Sharif Government had been under tremendous pressure from
the US to help it in having bin Laden captured and taken to the US for
interrogation and prosecution. The Government was reluctant to co-operate
with the US lest there be adverse impact on its relations with the Taliban
leadership and on the Pashtoons for whom bin Laden is a hero figure.&nbsp;
<p>It is likely that the ISI found a convenient way out of this dilemma
by helping bin Laden and his followers escape from FATA to the Kargil area
through the Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan) and set up a fresh sanctuary
in Indian territory, with the logistic and firepower backing of the Pakistani
army.
<p>Plausibly, it was the calculation of the ISI that this action would
provide a double advantage to Pakistan---escape pressure from the US for
action against bin Laden and add to the difficulties of the Indian army
in dealing with the insurgency in Kashmir.
<p>In an interview last year, bin Laden had said that while he was keen
to go to Kashmir and join in the "jihad" against the Indian authorities,
the Pakistani authorities would not permit him to do so. It is likely that
the Pakistani authorities have now decided to help him take sanctuary in
Indian territory and use his mercenaries against the Indian army.
