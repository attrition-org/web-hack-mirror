<P>Reuters reported that the Israeli government denied a previous report
in the Israeli daily <I>Ha'aretz</I> that claimed that Israel intelligence
told the United States to disregard a warning about a possible attack on
the American embassy in Nairobi.

<P><I>Ha'aretz </I>daily cited an Israeli security official as saying that
Washington had sought Israel's opinion on the reliability of the source
of the reported warning, to which Israel had replied that, based on its
past experiences with the man, the reliabtility of the source was questionable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said no basis for the report could be found. "We've checked back six months
and there is absolutely no truth or basis to the story," he said.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Were the embassy bombings revenge for CIA involvement
in extradicting terrorists from Albania?</B></FONT>

<P><I><A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1998-08/12/045l-081298-idx.html">The
Washigton Post</A></I> reported that American officials are investigating
the likelihood that the attacks could have been acts of revenge.&nbsp;
In June of this year a raid was carried out by security personnel from
the United States and Albania in Tirana against an alleged cell of an Islamic
terrorist organization.&nbsp; The raid evidently "went off like clockwork."

<P>The Albanians arrested two suspected employees of Saudi millionaire
Osama Bin Laden, and the Americans took custody of a van load of documents
and computer gear.

<P>However, the Albanians leaked a sketchy account of the raid, "including
an accurate statement about the CIA's prominent role in its planning" to
Albania's largest paper. According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, "By the
time a second raid was conducted two weeks later -- in which two more suspects
were arrested -- any hope of keeping Washington's fingerprints away from
the operation had died."

<P>A possible connection between this sequence of events and last Friday's
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania has provoked American
officials to begin investigating whether the attacks might have been revenge
by Bin Laden's organization for the CIA's role in the arrest of four of
its alleged members in Albania.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>CIA Blocked Two Attacks Last Year</B></FONT>

<P>CIA operatives foiled two attacks on U.S. embassies and disrupted three
other incipient plots last year.&nbsp; The planned attacks were discovered
after the CIA&nbsp; infiltrated terrorist cells, and succeeded in monitoring
and intercepting electronic communications, according to administration
and congressional sources cited by the <I>Washington Post</I>.

<P>The sources suggested that intelligence successes, both in preventing
embassy attacks and aiding in the arrest of more than 40 suspected terrorists
since 1993, may have contributed to the decision by whoever was behind
Friday's bombings to pick the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, both
of which were deemed low security risks by the State Department.

<P>The two more advanced plots, sources said, did not involve embassies
in Africa.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>U.S. Closes Threatened Embassies</B></FONT>

<P>The United States has temporarily suspended operations at about half
a dozen embassies after the State Department received information on threats
to U.S. interests. According to the Associated Press, the State department
named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen as threatened targets.
In Malaysia most services were suspended, and Americans were cautioned
to be on the alert. The warning was also in effect in Egypt and Yemen.
A senior U.S. official said the warnings were based on "credible information,"
but declined to provide any details.

<P>The U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, remained closed for a second day
Tuesday, and Ugandan and U.S. security personnel were on high alert five
days after terrorists bombed American diplomatic missions in neighboring
Kenya and Tanzania.

<P>Tanzania's ambassador, paying a condolence call at the State Department,
said some of the 14 foreigners detained in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy
in Dar es Salaam may have had a role in the attack. All 14 had been turned
over to the FBI for interrogation. They include six Iraqis, six Sudanese,
one Turk and one Somali, he said.
