<P><B>The Syrian Response</B>
<BR>The Syrians have so far refrained from voicing an official reaction
to the American offensive, however the Syrian state-controlled media quoted
an “official source” as condemning the strikes. The same source, quoted
by “Radio Damascus” (21 August) declared that “It is impossible to justify
such actions because they violate the sovereignty of nations and the sanctity
of their land, as well as gravely endangering the lives and property of
innocent people.” The same “official source” argued that Syria condemns
all forms of terrorism, including state terrorism, and that the use of
force if it is not in the framework of the UN Security Council “sets a
dangerous precedent that could endanger the basis of international law
and the UN charter. It invites acts of indiscriminate revenge without offering
any solution to the source of terrorism.”

<P>This reaction is characteristic of the rejectionist and hypocritical
tactics of Syria when dealing with terrorism. On the one hand she pays
lip service to the United States and the Western countries by condemning
terrorism in any form, and protesting the murder of innocent people in
Nairobi and in Dar es-Sala’am. At the same time, Syria denies the legitimacy
of the American response, arguing that such action violates international
law and the sovereignty of the countries in whose territory terrorists
have taken refuge. (This no doubt stems from the awareness of the connotations
of such a response toward Syria itself which harbors and supports a whole
list of terrorist organizations--Palestinian, Lebanese and others.)

<P>Ahmed Jibril’s organization, a Palestinian terror group operating under
Syrian patronage, allowed itself to take a sharper stand. The organization
issued a statement sharply condemning the American strikes and accusing
the United States of “state terrorism” and “hatred of everything Arab or
Islamic.” American is accused of the “Racist Zionist conquest of Palestine,”
the blockade against women, children and old people in Iraq and Libya,
and of supporting the rebels in southern Sudan.<B></B>

<P><B>The Lebanese Reaction</B>
<BR>A number of different sources and groups in Lebanon--inspired by Syria--have
taken an anti-American propaganda line. The most prominent was Hizballah.
In their announcement they sharply condemn the American offensive, and
interject an implied threat against the U.S. The Lebanese government was
somewhat more cautious, but refrained from supporting the U.S. attacks
on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and in Sudan.

<P>Sheikh Naim Kassem of Hizballah denounced the dangerous “American aggression”
and called on the international community to combat it. He also argued
that this “American aggression” constitutes interference in the affairs
of sovereign nations. Omar Musawi, Hizballah’s parliamentary representatives
in the Lebanese government and one of the group’s spokesmen declared (Reuters
in Beirut 21 August) that the American strikes are liable to bring about
more attacks on U.S. targets around. “The American logic justifying the
attacks,” he said, “means that Arab fighters can rightfully attack American
factories that produce weapons for the use of Israel in killing Arabs.”
Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of Hizballah and of
Lebanon’s Shi’ites, warned that American violence would expose the United
States to a wave of counter actions of increasing violence on the part
of the terrorist groups targeted by the U.S.

<P>Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Buez declared (August 21, 1998) that
there is a general impression that the evidence connecting the American
strikes with the bombings in Africa was insufficient.&nbsp; A “high-ranking
Lebanese official” quoted by the French News Agency Beirut as (August 21)
even argued that the American attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan were merely
intended to distract public opinion from the Lewinsky affair. Moreover,
it appears that the American strikes have the Lebanese government--which
supports and endorses terrorist activity from Lebanese soil--worried about
possible Israeli offensives in the same vein as the American one. Hence
“Radio Lebanon” reported (August 23) that the Lebanese Foreign Minister
had contacted the United States and France to warn that Israel might use
the American actions as an excuse to attack Lebanon. He asked the two countries
to intervene in order to prevent a further deterioration in the situation.
