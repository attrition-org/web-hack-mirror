Council Resolution 425</h2></center>

<p><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Characteristics of the Israeli Policy in Lebanon</FONT></B>

<P>The aim of Israel's present policy in Lebanon is to maximize the security
of Northern Israel, while disengaging itself from Lebanon’s internal affairs
and the political aspirations that were part of the Israeli policy before
and during the Lebanon War.

<P>This policy was expressed in the decision of the National Unity Government
of 14 January 1985, which stated that “the government will do everything
necessary to ensure the peace of the Galilee”. In addition the decision
determined that peace in the Galilee would be achieved by a redeployment
of IDF forces along the international border creating an area in South
Lebanon in which local forces (the South Lebanese Army - SLA) would operate
with the active support and backing of the IDF. This region later came
to be known as the “Security Zone”.

<P>This policy - supported over the years by all the Israeli governments,
regardless of their political leanings - has allowed the residents of Northern
Galilee to live for long periods a more or less normal life from the Lebanon
War up to the present. However, it cannot wholly solve the problem of terrorist
attacks from Lebanese territory. The heavy and painful price paid for the
security of Israeli citizens is the loss of lives of IDF soldiers in the
“security zone”.

<P>The preferred alternative to the “security zone” strategy would be a
peace agreement between Israel and Lebanon, which would settle the pending
problems between the two sides. However, due to the lack of progress towards
a peace agreement caused by Lebanon's total dependence on Syria, and the
prevalent potential for escalation in South Lebanon, Israel strives for
agreements strictly on the basis of security even before arriving at the
peace agreements with Syria and Lebanon. These security arrangements, worked
out through negotiation between Israel and Lebanon in the framework of
Security Council Resolution 425, should stop the bloodshed in South Lebanon,
thus paving the way for negotiations between Israel, Syria, and Lebanon
in the framework of the Madrid peace-process.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What Security Council Resolution 425 Stands For</FONT></B>
<BR>Security Council Resolution 425 was adopted on 19 March 1978, under
American auspices, towards the end of the IDF “Litani Operation” in Southern
Lebanon. The resolution is based on chapter 6 of the UN Charter, which
deals with the conclusion of disputes by peaceful means and by negotiation.
Its goal was the end of the “Litani Operation” and the withdrawal of IDF
forces from Lebanon. However, the resolution took into account the circumstances
that forced Israel to carry out the “Litani Operation”, and called for
the implementation of measures to put an end to the anti-Israeli terrorist
activity from South Lebanon and to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure.

<P>The resolution consists of two parts:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The first part</B> of the resolution calls for the respect of the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its
internationally recognized boundaries. The resolution calls for Israel
to immediately cease all military action in the framework of the “Litani
Operation” and to withdraw its forces from Lebanon.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>In the second part of the resolution</B>,<B> </B>the Security Council
calls for the establishment of a United Nations Interim Force (UNIFIL)
in South Lebanon<B> in order to meet three objectives</B>:</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
To confirm the withdrawal of the IDF forces.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
"To restore international peace and security”.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
"To assist the government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective
authority in the area”.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;

<P>According to a juridical interpretation<B>, these aims are not interchangeable
but must be considered as a whole</B>. This means that without the restoration
of international peace and security and an efficient and effective control
by the Lebanese government over its own territory, a unilateral IDF withdrawal
from Lebanon is neither possible nor profitable, since it would upset the
balance between these three objectives.

<P>It should be mentioned here that this point was emphasized at the time
(19 march, 1978) by the late Haim Hertzog, then Israelis ambassador to
the UN. He advised Prime Minister Menahem Begin to accept the resolution.
Hertzog, with the Prime Ministers approval, delivered the following speech
in the Security Council: “Israel understands the spirit of the resolution
as indicating a clear link between the withdrawal of our troops and the
establishment of an effective deterrent force against future terrorist
attacks. Israel has created conditions in which the government of Lebanon
can establish full control and sovereignty.”

<P>From the above we see that Security Council Resolution 425 deals only
in part with the IDF withdrawal from Lebanese territory. Clearly those
elements of the resolution concerning the restoration of Lebanese government
control and the restoration of peace and security in the region are necessary
conditions in filling the vacuum that would be created by the IDF pullout.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What Security Council Resolution 425 Does Not Say</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>
There is <B>no obligation for a unilateral and unconditional withdrawal</B>
of the IDF from Lebanon, as is often maintained by the Syrians and Lebanese
officials. Rather, what is proposed is a “package deal”, of which the IDF
pullout is only one component.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The resolution is not <B>a “court ruling” of an operative nature</B>, as
the Syrians and Lebanese claim. It is, rather, a recommendation, whose
implementation should be the result of negotiations between Israel and
Lebanon. The resolution is based on Chapter 6 of the UN Charter, which
calls for the resolution of disputes by discussions and negotiations.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>The resolution makes no mention of, nor does it have any connection
with, Syria.</B> Thus the Syrian-Lebanese demand for linkage between Resolution
425 and the Syrian-Israeli track are political arguments, not based on
resolution 425, and actually in conflict with it.</LI>
</UL>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Security Council Resolution 426</FONT></B>
<BR>As stipulated by resolution 425, the Secretary General of the United
Nations submitted a report to the Security Council on the implementation
of the resolution, and this report was adopted by the Security Council
as resolution 426 (19 march, 1978).

<P>Resolution 426 stipulates the creation of UNIFIL in order to implement
resolution 425, on the basis of Secretary Generals report. In his report
the Secretary General asserts that in order to enable UNIFIL to fulfill
its mandate “it may be necessary to work out <B>arrangements </B>with Israel
and Lebanon as a preliminary measure for the implementation of the Security
Council Resolution”. Clearly, the reference here is to <B>security arrangements.</B>

<P>In addition, the Secretary Generals report states that UNIFIL, as part
of its mandate, must ensure the cessation of all hostile activity, by either
side, in the area under its jurisdiction. In other words, the area in which
UNIFIL and the Lebanese army will deploy will not be used for terrorist
activity of any kind.

<P>The Lebanese, for their part, claim that Security Council Resolution
426 calls for separate discussions - between Israel and the UN, and between
Lebanon and the UN, and that negotiations between Lebanon and Israel are
superfluous. This assertion is contrary to the spirit of resolutions 425
and 426 (as well as to Chapter 6 of the U.N. Charter, on which the resolutions
are based) and to the precedent set by the military talks between Israel
and Lebanon in Nakoura.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Obstacles to Implementation of the Resolution</FONT></B>

<P><B>Why has the resolution not been implemented during the twenty years
of its existence?</B>
<BR>The main obstruction to the immediate implementation of the resolution
was the total collapse of the Lebanese government and army during the civil
war. While the resolution stipulates the effective restoration of the Lebanese
government control over Southern Lebanon, the lack of a competent central
government in Lebanon left a vacuum. This void was filled by Palestinian
terrorist organizations (prior to 1982) and by Lebanese terrorist organizations,
mainly Hizballa (after the Lebanon war). UNIFIL, originally intended as
an important tool in the Resolution's implementation, proved ineffective,
operating under a mandate that precluded an effective fight against terror.

<P>The military talks in Nakoura between Israel and Lebanon (8 November
1984- 24 January 1985) to work out the “security arrangements” for the
implementation of resolution 425 failed because of this main problem, and
because Syria's tough stance, while enabling the Lebanese to participate
in the talks, at the same time encouraged them to stick to a inflexible
stance. Neither party was willing to consider Israel's legitimate security
requirements. During the Washington talks that took place within the framework
of the Madrid Peace process (1991-1993) the accent transferred towards
peace agreements. As far as Israel was concerned, these talks were not
concerned with the implementation of Resolution 425, which is, by nature,
a security issue.

<P>It should be emphasized that the military talks in Nakoura between Israeli
and Lebanese military delegations dealt from the Lebanese point of view
with the implementation of Security Council Resolution 425. On the 31<SUP>st</SUP>
of October 1984, eight days before the opening of the talks, after consultations
with Syria, Lebanon and Israel, UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar sent
a letter to the president of the Security Council, which served as a conceptual
basis for the talks. From this letter it is clear that the UN Secretary's
position is that the talks should deal with the IDF withdrawal and the
working out of security arrangements. Thus, peace and security may be restored
to the area and the control of the local government re-established, as
was stipulated by Resolution 425 (for UN secretary's letter see appendix).

<P><B>What has Changed Today?</B>
<BR>The Lebanese Army has in the past few years gone through a process
of reconstruction, and has proven itself in the fight against the Palestinians,
the Lebanese militias disbanded according to the “Taif Agreement” (1989),
and against Shi’ite supporters of Subhi al-Tufeili in the Beka'a Valley.
The Lebanese army, assisted by UNIFIL and with international backing could,
in our opinion, successfully fill the vacuum created by the withdrawal
of the IDF, conditional on receiving the "green light" from the Syrian
government, which has not yet been given.

<P>&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What are the Security Arrangements Demanded by Israel?</FONT></B>
<BR>In an interview to the “al-Watan al-Arabi” (2 January, 1998) in which
the Israeli Defense Minister first presented the initiative dealing with
Security Council Resolution 425, he was asked if he had any concrete ideas
about what the security arrangements demanded by Israel should include.

<P>The minister did not go into the details of the arrangements, but he
clarified the leading principles: these arrangements must include a complete
cessation of terrorist activities against Israel from Lebanese territory;
they must dismantle the terrorist organizations' military infrastructure,
thus ensuring the safety of the South Lebanese Army and of the citizens
living in the “Security Zone” and Jezzine; and they must include the effective
deployment of the Lebanese Army with both the responsibility and the authority
to take action in South Lebanon. Fulfillment of all these conditions will
enable the restoration of Lebanese government control in South Lebanon,
and the withdrawal of the IDF.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>In Conclusion</FONT></B>
<BR>The initiative to implement Security Council Resolution 425 made it
clear to public opinion in Israel, Lebanon, the Arab world and the International
Community that Israel truly wishes to stop the bloodshed in Lebanon, and
that it is ready to withdraw the IDF from Lebanon, with the necessary security
arrangements required by the Resolution. At the same time the initiative
also showed the conflict between the Lebanese national interest that asks
for the implementation of the Resolution, and the Syrian particular interest,
which attempts to use the “Lebanese card” to put pressure on Israel to
meet its demands on the Golan Heights. We have no doubt that if it were
up to the Lebanese their response would be quite different. The Israeli
initiative has thus placed both Lebanon and Syria in a politically defensive
position, and sent Syria into a frenzy of diplomatic activity, in order
to make sure that Lebanese government officials "toe the line".

<P>At this stage the initiative is still in its initial phase, and needs
a great deal of patience from all the parties concerned. The initiative
will need intensive political activity and creative thought in order to
overcome the difficulties ahead, and first and foremost that presented
by Syria's tough stance. There are no guarantees, of course, that this
political activity will bring the hoped-for results but it must be remembered
that the alternatives look less promising and more dangerous.
