<p><center><h2>Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon: New Source of
Cross-Border Tension?</h2></center>

<p><p>While Hizballah still mulls over its options in the wake of Israel’s
withdrawal from Lebanon-terrorism, political activism, or both-there remains
in Lebanon one other sizable community that could be the source of renewed
tension and violence: the 350,000 Palestinian refugees. This group has
a long and tortured history in Lebanon, but the development of the Oslo
process (which most refugees in Lebanon perceive as an illegitimate betrayal
of their cause), along with both the loss of Syrian-Lebanese leverage over
Israel following unilateral withdrawal and the increasing desperation of
the refugees, has fostered those ideological movements inside the refugee
camps that may turn violent in order to bring attention to the refugees’
humanitarian plight.
<p><b>Ideological Landscape</b>
<br>Fatah, traditionally the most dominant group in the Palestinian refugee
camps in Lebanon, has been attempting to reconsolidate control by installing
Arafat loyalists in the leadership of the camps’ Popular Committees. This
has been partially successful; in August 1999, Fatah did gain at least
partial control over Lebanon’s largest refugee camp, Ein al-Hilweh. Any
power Fatah has been able to recoup however, has been partly offset by
the gains made in the camps by the various Islamist groups. Hamas, Palestinian
Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and several smaller and more extremist groups aligned
with Hizballah have made substantial inroads in refugee support in the
camps over the last few years as the political influence of Fatah (and,
to some degree, the other secular-leftist groups like the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]) has diminished.
<p><b>Secular Rejectionist Groups</b>
<br>These groups are all supported by or under the influence of Damascus;
thus it is likely that they will yield to Syrian wishes regarding their
operations. They all maintain some infrastructure and support in the Bekaa
Valley, and in the past they engaged in terrorist activities both against
Israeli targets and in the international arena. The Fatah Rebels, the Abu
Nidal Organization, and the PFLP-General Command (PFLP-GC) are uncompromising
toward Israel and the Oslo process. The Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine (DFLP) opposes accommodation with Israel, although founder
Naif Hawatma has petitioned to return to the West Bank. The PFLP is undergoing
a leadership transition; founder George Habash’s deputy and putative successor
Abu Ali Mustafa returned to the West Bank and expressed a willingness to
be incorporated into the Palestinian mainstream, although he also opposes
Oslo.
<p><b>Islamist Groups</b>
<br>Hamas and PIJ are the most active in the refugee camps, although the
Lebanese group Hizballah and extremist splinter factions such as Usbat
al-Ansar and al-Jamal Islamiya are also active. The vacuum left by the
combination of Fatah’s focus on activities in the Palestinian Authority
and the decision of the other secular groups to give priority to political
over military action has given unprecedented opportunity for the Islamist
groups to gain support in the camps. Although in the past Hamas collaboration
with Hizballah was limited, lately the two have developed closer ties.
This relationship extends from the training of Hamas operatives in Iran
to cooperative recruitment efforts in the refugee camps. PIJ, the other
major Islamist group, has focused on military operations against Israel,
creating opportunities to exploit Hizballah’s resources and facilities
in Lebanon.
<p>The fostering of improved relations between Hamas, PIJ, and the Iranians
(through Hizballah) has dramatically increased the groups’ penetration
of the camps, expanding their influence and their ability to mobilize there.
That Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi toured southern Lebanon only
two days after the Israeli withdrawal demonstrates that Iran remains determined
to boost its involvement with Hizballah as well as its role as patron of
the organization’s “victory” over Israel. Although Hizballah may want to
keep a low profile on Israel’s northern border for some time, these Palestinian
groups can provide a willing and increasingly better-trained proxy to continue
the fight. Moreover, these groups can lay claim to a legitimacy Hizballah
no longer has: although Israel has withdrawn from Lebanon, the refugees
have had no relief for their predicament.
<p>More disturbing than the sheer growth of the Islamist movements in the
camps is the growing evidence of their links to terrorist groups outside
Lebanon. For example, Usbat al-Ansar, the Islamist splinter group in Ein
al-Hilweh with ties to Osama bin Ladin, has been linked to the Jordanian
group arrested in December 1999 for terrorist conspiracies and is currently
on trial. Usbat al-Ansar was involved in clashes with the Lebanese Armed
Forces in January 2000 that occurred concurrently with riots in northern
Lebanon pitting other Sunni Islamists against the Lebanese government.
Also in the north, Hizb’al-Tahrer al-Islamiya (the Islamic Liberation Party)
has escalated its activities in northern Lebanon, especially among Palestinians
not living in refugee camps.
<p>Hizballah is furthermore actively exporting its experience to Islamist
groups in the West Bank and Gaza. Reportedly, the group recently issued
a joint statement with Hamas calling for the “Lebanonization” of the territories-an
imperative not only to continue violent activities, but to switch from
terrorist to guerilla tactics. In May 2000, the Hamas monthly <i>Falastin
al-Muslima</i> made this call explicitly. And the Hamas website reported
this quote from the semi-official Palestinian newspaper <i>al-Hayat al-Jadida</i>:
“O Lebanese joy, spread your delicious disease among us!”
<p><b>Policy Imperatives</b>
<br>In his report on Israel’s implementation of United Nations (UN) Security
Council Resolution 425, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan hinted at the importance
of Palestinian radical organizations when he referred to the roles of both
“Lebanese and other armed groups” (emphasis added). Addressing this problem
requires the recognition that Hizballah is not the only wild card poised
to promote violence among Palestinian groups toward Israeli targets. The
refugees also present the Syrians with an opportunity to launch proxy attacks
reminding Israel that peace will not come until the Golan Heights are returned
to Damascus. Although Syria is the principal conduit of Iranian aid to
Hizballah, Damascus also extends support-overflights, landing rights, tacit
permission-for Tehran’s outreach to Palestinian Islamist groups. Syrian
intentions are therefore central to the maintaining of quiet both on the
northern border and within the Palestinian camps themselves. As outside
parties like the U.S. government warn Syria it that will be held responsible
for ensuring calm on the Israel-Lebanon border, this arrow in Syria’s quiver
must be kept in mind.
<p>Apart from an eventual refugee solution contained in a Palestinian-Israeli
final status agreement, the lack of adequate arrangements for alleviating
the refugees’ plight in Lebanon must be recognized. There is a need for
interim policies to forestall violence and stunt the growth of the terrorist
cells within the refugee camps. This kind of policy will have to encompass
both “sticks” and “carrots.” Specifically, the United States should encourage
Lebanon to improve the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian refugees
by, for example, loosening restrictions on employment, education, travel,
and access to health care. Washington and other parties should also require
the Lebanese to provide the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
with the authority to act decisively against violent groups should it become
necessary, relaxing the rules of engagement and giving UNIFIL soldiers
jurisdiction to carry out enforcement both in and around the camps and
on the border with Israel. This two-pronged approach is in the besinterests
of an international community anxious about the potential for renewed violence
on the Israel-Lebanon frontier and of the Lebanese government itself, legitimately
concerned about the prospect of destabilization on the border and within
the refugee camps.
