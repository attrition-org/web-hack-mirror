<P><B>ICT Commentary</B>

<P>Quite apart from the clear operational reasons for attacking the "al-Shifa"
facility in Khartoum--if as Western intelligence sources maintain, the
factory was engaged in chemical weapons production--there are other factors
linking bin Ladin to Sudan.

<P>Osama bin Ladin has been involved in a number of commercial operations
in Sudan.&nbsp; His Sudanese projects include&nbsp; agriculture, construction
and infrastucture.&nbsp; For many years, bin Ladin lived in Khartoum, in
a residence guarded by the local security forces, while he was arranging
for many of the "Afghan veterans" to move to Sudan.&nbsp; Bin Ladin is
said to be close to Sudanese&nbsp; leader Omar Albashir, and to Hassan
Turabi, the head of the National Islamic Front (NIF) in Sudan.

<P>Bin Ladin worked in partnership with wealthy NIF members on joint infrastructure
and development projects all over Sudan.&nbsp; A good deal of his construction
work there has been done for the Sudanese government. There are rumors
too, that several companies are still bringing in money for him. Among
these is "el-Hijrah for Construction and Development Ltd." This is the
company that built the new airport at Port Sudan, as well as a 1200 km-long
highway linking Khartoum to Port Sudan.

<P>Another company reputed to be owned by bin Ladin is the "Wadi al-Aqiq"
Company, an export-import firm.&nbsp; He also runs the Taba Investment
Company Ltd. and the "el-Shamal Islamic Bank" in Khartoum, a joint effort
with the&nbsp; NIF, in which bin Ladin is said to have&nbsp; invested $50
million.
