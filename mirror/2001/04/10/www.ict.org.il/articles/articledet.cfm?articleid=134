<p><center><h2>Hizballah and Fatah: a New Alliance against Israel</h2></center>

<p><p>In the present violent events between Israel and the Palestinians, called by the Palestinians “the Al-Aqsa Uprising,” two prominent phenomena
have come to the fore as the most important new developments in the Palestinian
arena and in future Israeli-Palestinian relations. One is the relative
independence of the armed Fatah militia ranks and their consolidation,
at least for the time being, as a popular semi-opposition group. The other,
and the more dangerous development, is the success of Hizballah, and 
indirectly of Iran, in significantly increasing their influence among the
Palestinians.
<p>These two new developments, which are interconnected,
were best shown during the violent demonstrations of the past weeks, particularly
the protest demonstrations against the participation of Arafat in the summit
at Sharm el-Sheikh on 16-17 October. No one can ignore the combination
of Fatah members and the yellow flags of Hizballah, which in some instances
dominated even the green flags of Hamas.
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font size=+1>Iran and Hizballah in the Palestinian arena</font></b></center>

<p>The relationship between Hizballah and the Palestinian national leadership,
as represented by the PLO and later the Palestinian Authority, has been
complicated for many years. This is due to the hostility between the Palestinian
leadership and Iran, on the background of the uncompromising support of
the Palestinians for Iraq since the early 1980s.
<p>The Iranian Islamic regime has emphasized the “liberation of Al-Quds”
from its early days, as part of its efforts to “export” the Islamic revolution
and its ideology to the Sunni Arab world. It failed to greatly influence
the Shiites of Iraq during the Iran-Iraqi war of 1980-1988, but succeeded
in using the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in June 1982 to increase its
influence among the Shiites of Lebanon. However, the Islamic Shiite resistance
to Israel, dominated since 1985 by the Iranian-sponsored Hizballah, did
not really affect the Palestinians. Even the powerful Islamic movement
of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood that in 1987 became Hamas was not
much influenced by the combined Hizballah-Iranian efforts. Only a minor
group of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) became totally identified
with the Iranian regime. This failure, recurring all over the Arab world
as well, was reinforced by the political process of reconciliation between
Israel and the Palestinians since 1993.
<p>Arafat and senior officials of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah,
including security officials, have accused the Iranians many times during
the 1990s of attempting to stop the peace process, and even of attempting
to kill Arafat. In general, the struggle of Hizballah against Israel in
Lebanon gained a relatively low level of interest among the Palestinians
in the Territories, until last year.
<p><b>Hamas and Iran</b>
<br>All this began to change gradually in 1992-93, as a result of the contacts
established between Hizballah and the 415 deportees of Hamas and the PIJ
to South Lebanon. But the relations between the Lebanese and Palestinian
Islamic groups had primarily an operational nature in the field of military
and terrorist training and support. The clandestine nature of the relations
was not translated into Palestinian public support for the Iranians or
significant support for Hizballah. Between 1994-1999 several tens of Hamas
members were trained in Iran, and others reinforced their contacts with
Hizballah in Lebanon, mainly through activists of the PFLP-GC (Jibril’s
Front).
<p>The first significant contacts between Iran and Hamas started in mid
1990s in the Sudan, whose influential Islamic regime was one of the most
prominent elements in encouraging and promoting terrorist activity in the
Arab and Islamic world. However, the Sudan, which was involved during the
1990s in attempts of mediation between Hamas and Fatah, remained insignificant
in the Palestinian arena.
<p>The breakthrough of politically significant contacts between Hamas and
Iran occurred with the visit of Ahmad Yasin to Tehran in April 1998, following
his release from prison. The improving relations between Iran and Hamas
brought about two main processes:
<ol>
<li>
Legitimacy of Iran in the Territories for the first time.</li>

<li>
The improvement of relations between Hizballah and certain Palestinian
groups in the refugee camps in Lebanon, including certain Fatah elements.</li>
</ol>
<b>Hizballah gains popular support in the Territories</b>
<br>Public support for Hizballah among the Palestinians in the Territories
started to rise on the eve of the Israeli withdrawal in May 2000. The first
signs came during the visit of the French Prime Minister to the Palestinian
Authority on February 2000. His announcements of condemnation towards Hizballah
were met with violent demonstrations by Palestinian students. The Israeli
withdrawal three months later was publicly interpreted among the Palestinians
as an obvious victory for Hizballah over Israel, and brought about waves
of Palestinian sympathy for the Lebanese movement, primarily among the
students and the youth of all the Palestinian political trends.
<p>The struggle of Hizballah, which in Palestinian eyes led to the termination
of the Israeli occupation in Lebanon, was adopted as a model by many Palestinian
youngsters, and not necessarily supporters of Hamas or the Islamic radicals.
Such sympathy was also found among certain Israeli Arab elements, primarily
the radical faction of the Islamic movement, and even Arab members of the
Knesset, who praised the Lebanese movement without raising any great outcry
in the Israeli government. Hamas openly called for the “Lebanonization”
of the Palestinian Territories and was backed by public statements by some
Fatah factions.
<p>As was obvious in the recent events in the Territories, the support
for Hizballah affected mainly the younger Palestinian generation in general,
and the ranks of Fatah’s <i>Tanzim</i> in particular. The frustration of
the Palestinian public that followed Arafat’s decision not to announce
the establishment of a Palestinian state on September 13<sup>th</sup>,
led to anger among wide circles of the Palestinian populous.
<p>This pushed Arafat to oppose any further implementation of the peace
process by popular violence initiated and directed by his so-called Fatah
loyalist <i>Tanzim</i>, and encouraged by the official security forces.
The outcome was violent armed clashes between Palestinians and Israelis,
of the kind reminiscent of the violence in the Lebanese civil war. However,
the struggle of Hizballah turned out to be not only the preferred model
but gave the Shiite movement full legitimacy in the Palestinian arena.
The call of Hamas to “Lebanonize” the Territories right after the Israeli
withdrawal fell on open Palestinian ears.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>

<p><b><font size=+1>The consolidation of a new alliance</font></b></center>

<p>The new situation was preceded by certain developments in Lebanon and
among Palestinian refugees. At the end of 1999 and the beginning of 2000,
there were violent clashes with the Lebanese police and security forces,
which brought to light a new phenomenon—a collaboration of Fatah military
activists in the Palestinian refugee camps with small local militant Islamic
groups.
<p>One of the prominent figures in this regard was Munir Makdah, one of
Fatah’s most powerful commanders. At the same time, Makdah was accused
by the Jordanian authorities of membership in a terrorist group dismantled
in Jordan in December 1999. The group was accused of planning terrorist
operations against American and Israeli targets in Jordan and maintaining
connections with Osamah Bin Ladin. Makdah himself was sentenced to death
<i>in absentia. </i>Details of the investigations published by the Jordanian
authorities revealed that Makdah and other Fatah activists in Lebanon were
in close contact with Hizballah and the PIJ. This was in addition to the
constant improvement of the relations between Iran and Hamas, on both the
operational and political levels following the expulsion of Hamas leaders
from Jordan in 1999.
<p>Another element to note here is the silent support of Hamas for the
Palestinian national leadership during the recent events. In most instances
Hamas as a movement did not take any organized part. The movement has generally
aligned itself with the Palestinian national interests. Furthermore, in
most of its pamphlets and official pronouncements Hamas called for the
increase of the <i>popular</i> means of struggle rather than terrorist
operations. It would seem that at least in the field of the popular struggle
there was a sort of coordination between Hamas and Fatah’s <i>Tanzim</i>,
in which Hamas gave the <i>Tanzim</i> the seniority in leading the events.
<p>It should also be noted, that besides the yellow flags of Hizballah
in the Palestinian demonstrations, the demonstrators also displayed photos
of Hamas martyrs, especially that of Yahya `Ayyash. In the past years,
it appears that Hamas terrorist operations against Israel have gained a
good deal of support and popularity among the younger generations of the
Palestinians, including Fatah ranks. Hamas supplied the Palestinian youngsters
and supporters of Fatah the military legacy they lacked in the wake of
Fatah’s abstention from the terrorist operations since the early 1990s.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Conclusion: Whither Fatah after Arafat?</font></b></center>

<p>It seems so far that the deterioration of the relations between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority, together with the symbolic position of Jerusalem
and Al-Aqsa in the events, gave rise to the consolidation of a new alliance:
Hamas with Fatah’s <i>Tanzim</i> in the Territories; Hizballah with Fatah
ranks in Lebanon. On the two sides of this alliance stand the past rivals,
Iran and the Palestinian leadership.
<p>One question for the near future is on one hand how far Arafat and his
leadership are controlling events and how much they are controlled by them, and whether they control the so-called loyal opposition of Fatah. In addition, there is the question
of how far the new alliance affects the Palestinian security forces, among
which exist rivalries and hostilities beneath the present united public
front.
<p>But the most important question is whether we see in the present position
of the <i>Tanzim</i> the beginning of the struggle for the succession of
Arafat. If this is the case, the increasing influence of Hizballah, and
indirectly of Iran, could be significant to the future of the Palestinian
population of the Territories and Lebanon, as well as the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations.
