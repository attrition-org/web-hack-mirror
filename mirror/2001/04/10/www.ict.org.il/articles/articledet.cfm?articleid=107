Network</h2></center>

<p><p><b>Introduction</b>
<br>In December 1999 a group of 13 Islamists (11 Jordanians, Iraqi and
an Algerian) was arrested in Jordan on suspicion of intention to attack
American and Israeli targets in Jordan on the occasion of the Millennium.
<p>The list of the detainees as published in the Jordanian dailies <i>al-Ra’I</i>
and <i>al-Dustur</i> indicates that at least nineteen are of Palestinian
origin, including fifteen Jordanian citizens and four residents of Syria,
Lebanon, and the United Kingdom (UK). The group includes Munir Husein Maqdah,
a former senior commander of Fatah (the Palestine Liberation Organization
faction headed by Yasir Arafat), and Omar Mahmoud Abu Omar, also known
as Abu Qutadah, who allegedly financed the group from his political asylum
in London. Also among the defendants is an American citizen of Palestinian
origin, Khalil Dik, who was arrested in Pakistan and extradited to Jordan
as part of this group. Another Jordanian of Palestinian origin, `Isam al-Burqawi
a.k.a. Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, was arrested after he had been released
from four years in prison, in 1999.
<p>On March 28<sup>th</sup> 2000, the Jordanian authorities put 28 defendants
on trial, thirteen of whom were tried <i>in absentia</i>. The defendants
were, according to the Jordanian authorities, part of the global Islamist
network of Osama bin Ladin and his al-Qa’idah organization.
<p>The large proportion of Palestinians among the defendants should come
as no surprise. Palestinian Islamists have traditionally played an active
role in the global Islamist networks. The recent arrests are but the latest
episode in a long history of Palestinian involvement in the Islamist revivals
in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Afghanistan, and other Arab countries beginning
in the early 1950s.
<p>What makes this trend more interesting, however, is the fact that Osama
bin Ladin and his ideas are not at all popular among the Palestinian Islamic
groups in the Palestinian Autonomy or the Israeli administered territories.
There has been no evidence of any connection or affiliation between the
bin Ladin groups and the three main Palestinian Islamic movements Hamas,
the PIJ, and the Islamic Liberation Party or the smaller Palestinian groups
of <i>Salafiyyun</i> that adhere to the Wahhabi doctrine prevalent in Saudi
Arabia.
<p>Palestinian involvement in Jordanian politics is a natural consequence
of the Palestinian majority in the Hashemite Kingdom (at least 55%), as
well as the legacy of the British Mandate in Jordan and Palestine. However,
the influence of Palestinian Islamists in Jordan and elsewhere in the Arab
and Islamic World is out of all proportion to their actual numbers. During
the Afghani struggle against the Soviets in the 1980s there were a disproportionate
number of Palestinian volunteers among the Afghan rebels. Many of these
volunteers stayed on in Afghanistan after the war, as part of the “Arab
Afghans,” the main cadre of bin Ladin’s Islamic Front.
<p><b>Palestinian Involvement in the International Islamic Arena</b>
<br>Below is a short summary of the Palestinian involvement in the Islamist
revival:
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Islamic Liberation Party.</b> In 1952 and 53, a group of Palestinians
led by Shaykh Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani founded the Islamic Liberation Party
(Hizb al-Tahrir al-Islami). The party opened branches in Lebanon, Syria,
Iraq, and later on in Germany, the UK and France. In the 1980s, it began
operating in Turkey, India, and Pakistan, and in the 1990s widened its
activity to Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan) and the South Caucasus (primarily
Dagestan). Although the party has not been involved in the popular uprising
against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967, it has a long
history of terrorist and subversive activity elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<dir>In 1974, Dr. Salih Sirriyyah, a Palestinian member of the party led
the Islamist group that carried out the first terrorist operation—against
the military academy in Cairo—in the era of the Islamic revival in Egypt.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
Another former member and one of the founders of the Islamic Liberation
Party, Sheikh As`ad Bayyoud al-Tamimi was the spiritual leader of one of
the fractions of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad was quiet influential in
the Gulf States.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
According to the Uzbek authorities, the Islamic Liberation Party was behind
the attempt to assassinate Islam Karimov, the Uzbek president, in February
1999.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
The party has been involved in political subversion and terrorism against
the Jordanian regime since the 1950s, and was since been outlawed in Jordan
and many of it members arrested. Early this year, there was another wave
of arrests among its members and supporters in Jordan and Syria. More recently,
in February 2000, members of the party were involved in violent clashes
with the Lebanese Armed Forces in northern Lebanon.
<p>Although Palestinians have a strong influence in the party, they are
not involved in all its branches and activities. For the past two decades,
the party has operated a large base in London, allowing it to influence
Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the UK.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).</b> The only Islamic group in the entire
Sunni Arab world that wholeheartedly supports the Iranian Islamic revolution
and the Iranian regime is the PIJ. Its founder, Dr. Fathi Shqaqi, who was
killed in 1995, was the first to praise and adopt the principles of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, which he did in a book published in Egypt in March 1979,
just one month after the Iranian revolution. Iran’s policy of “exporting
the revolution” to the Sunni Arab world has been a total failure except
for the PIJ’s activities in the Palestinian arena.</li>
</ul>

<dir>
<li>
<b>Afghan Arabs.</b> One of the most prominent ideologues of the Afghani
struggle of the Mujahidin was Dr. Abdallah Azzam, a Palestinian living
in Jordan, who moved in 1980 to Peshawar, Pakistan, to take part in the
war in Afghanistan. Azzam is the father of the theory of<i> al-Qa’idah
al-Sulbah</i> (the solid base) which is the doctrinal foundation of bin
Ladin’s group.</li>

<p>Abdallah Azzam influenced many Jordanians of Palestinian origin to join
the Afghani jihad in the 1980s against the Soviet occupation, and to stay
there or join the fight in other places (Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, or Chechnya)
during the 1990s.
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
Azzam was killed by a car bomb in Peshawar in November 1989, as part of
the struggle among the various factions of the Afghan Mujahidin following
the Afghani victory over the Soviets. Rumors have consistently linked bin
Ladin to Azzam’s assassination, though there is no proof of a connection.
Upon his death, Azzam left behind him dozens of books on religious doctrines,
religious <i>Fatawa</i> (rulings) and a comprehensive ideology of Jihad.
<p>Azzam has been well known and admired in the West Bank and Gaza for
some time. Although his doctrines are not accepted by Hamas, a Hamas terrorist
squad in the northern West Bank (the region of Azzam’s birth) bears his
name.</dir>

<ul START=0>
<li>
<b>Lebanon</b>. Islamism appears to have spread in recent years to the
Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. February saw renewed activity by
a small Islamist group called <i>‘Usbat al-Ansar</i> (the League of Supporters)
in the Ein el-Hilweh camp. It also was interesting to see the previously
mentioned Munir Husein Maqdah, a former prominent commander of the Palestinian
Fatah organization in Lebanon, among the defendants in the millennium bombing
plot in Jordan.</li>
</ul>

<ul START=0>
<li>
<b>Jordan and the Gulf States</b>. Palestinian participation in Islamist
terrorism in Jordan has been prominent among some small terrorist groups
uncovered in Jordan since the 1980s, such as <i>Jaysh Muhammad </i>(the
Army of Muhammad), <i>al-Islah wal-Tahaddi</i> (Reform and Challenge) and
<i>Takfir</i>
(Repudiation). One of the defendants in the trial in Jordan, Shaykh ‘Isam
al-Burqawi (known as Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi), a Palestinian from Nablus,
has had significant religious influence among Palestinians in Jordan. He
was imprisoned there between 1995 and 1999 and detained again in the present
wave of arrests of Islamists in Jordan.</li>
</ul>

<dir>Many Palestinians in the Gulf States, alienated from the local society,
found refuge in Islamic activities for financial support and a paranational
identity. For many years, the Gulf States were a hotbed of Islamist doctrines,
and a haven for exiles from other Arab states. Together with Saudi Arabia,
the Gulf States were the main financiers of the Palestinians, as well as
Palestinian Islamist social, cultural, political and welfare activities.
Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the Gulf war in 1991,
two major trends emerged with regard to the Palestinians:
<dir>&nbsp;
<br>a) Many Palestinians were deported from the Gulf States. The deportees
were unwilling to return to Palestinian territories due to the Israeli
occupation and the <i>intifada</i>, which led to massive unemployment.
According to Jordanian data, about 60,000 Palestinians found refuge in
Jordan, which added to the already high rate of unemployment there. This
situation left many Palestinians open to Islamist propaganda and induced
hundreds of young Palestinians to go to Afghanistan.
<p>b)<b> </b>The PLO’s support and that of the Palestinians in general
for Iraq, caused many in the Gulf States, individuals as well as governments
to halt their financial support to the PLO. As a result large sums of money
were transferred instead to Palestinian Islamic movements and institutions
in the Palestinian Territories and elsewhere. In addition the Gulf States
significantly increased their financial support to all kinds of Palestinian
Islamic funds in the USA and Europe, particularly in the UK.</dir>
</dir>
<b>Palestinian Support for Islamist Movements in Jordan and Lebanon</b>
<br>All of the developments cited above led to the increase of Palestinian
support for the Islamist movements in Jordan and elsewhere, quite apart
from the influence on Palestinian residents in Jordan of Hamas, which is
supported by the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood. But there were additional
reasons for the growth of the Islamist influence upon Palestinians, which
should be borne in mind:
<ol>
<li>
The relatively large and persistent opposition of most of Jordanian society
to any form of normalization (<i>Tatbi`</i>) with Israel. This opposition
is common to the Islamists, most of the intellectuals, the labor and trade
unions, most of the Media and the weak Jordanian Left. This opposition
leads to strengthening of the Islamic Front on one hand, and to the anti-Western
bias felt by many Palestinians on the other. The strict opposition to normalization
with Israel in many cases reflects more general anti-Western notions and
social impediments in assimilating Western modernization.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
The large opposition of Palestinians in both Jordan and Lebanon to the
Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority and the negotiations with Israel.
Apart from the Islamic influence, there is a growing belief among Palestinians
outside of the Palestinian territories that the PA will eventually abandon
the right of return, in return for Israeli concessions on major issues
such as the Palestinian Statehood, Israeli settlements and the status of
Jerusalem. Lately rumors have spread among the Palestinians in Jordan regarding
plans to resettle them in Iraq. Such rumors, together with the uncertain
prospects of the talks with Israel concerning the right of return of the
300,000 Palestinian refugees from the 1967 war, most of whom live in Jordan.
This too, increases the Islamist influence on Palestinians in Jordan and
in the refugee camps in Lebanon. Thus many young Palestinians, in particular
come to support the global Islamist Jihad.</li>
</ol>
The role of the United States in the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians, together with what many Palestinians see as the American
patronage over the Palestinian Authority also leads to an increase in anti-Western
and anti-American feelings. This in turn brings many Palestinian to identify
with the global anti-American and anti-Jewish ideology as disseminated
by bin Ladin and his network. Part of this identification is also the result
of what the Islamists see as the extensive role played by the CIA in the
functioning of the Palestinian Authority. The cooperation between the CIA
and the Palestinian and Israeli security services is perceived as an exemplary
example of the global Western-Jewish conspiracy against Islam. In fact,
there is no place in the Middle East—not even in Israel—where the CIA is
so much involved in the fight against the Islamic opposition, nor where
it has offices and facilities known to the public.
<p>The anti-Jewish messages espoused by Bin Ladin and his Arab Afghan supporters
is attractive to many Palestinians and corresponds with similar anti-Jewish
motifs common to other Palestinian and Arab Islamic groups.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Conclusions</b>
<p>The relatively large participation of Palestinians in the Islamist global
network in the last decade should come as no surprise. It should be noted,
however, that much Palestinian sympathy for—and therefore participation
in—this phenomenon takes place primarily outside of the Palestinian Autonomy.
This is particularly true in the case of Palestinian support for Osama
bin Ladin and the loose network of groups supporting him. The political,
economic, and social pressures on Palestinian society will no doubt continue
to contribute to popular Palestinian support in the foreseeable future—particularly
outside of the autonomous territories—for the global Islamist struggle.
Even were bin Ladin to vanish tomorrow, this popular support would be undiminished
due to the conglomeration of factors involved.
