<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>A New Strategy Against the New Terror</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>By Boaz Ganor</B>
<BR>Reprinted from "Policy View", The Shalem Center - National Policy Institute,
No. 10, January, 1995

<P>The Middle East peace process was intended to channel disagreements
between Israel and the PLO onto a track of political negotiations. Yet,
concealed within the process is a long-term danger: If gains in the negotiations
are viewed by Palestinian Arabs as the result of rising Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism, this will produce an even greater incentive to adhere to terrorism
as a method of doing business. A new anti-terror strategy is needed which
will recognize the centrality of public stamina in coping with terror,
so that terrorist groups will not attain their goal of demoralizing the
Israeli public. The strategy must also include: Rigorous enforcement of
the obligation of the PLO leadership to oppose terrorism; refusal to release
imprisoned terrorist-murderers; aggressive action against terror groups;
and the nurturing of international cooperation in the war against terrorism.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I. BACKGROUND: THE CHANGING FACE OF TERROR AGAINST ISRAEL</FONT>

<P>Over the course of the intifada, and during the peace process between
Israel and its neighbors, there have been periodic changes in the characteristics
of the terror war waged against Israeli targets in all arenas (within the
Green Line, in the territories, and outside of Israel). This is a process
that started in the mid-1980s and is continuing today; it encompasses all
aspects of terrorism, including identity of the perpetrators, motives,
methods employed, and locations chosen for attacks.

<P>THE RISE IN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST TERROR

<P>Since the end of the 1980s, and especially since the signing of the
Oslo accords, there has been a steady increase in the frequency of terrorism
committed by Muslim fundamentalist terrorist organizations. At the same
time, the activity of the secular Palestinian organizations has decreased.

<P>The new prominence in the territories of such organizations as Hamas
and factions of the Islamic Jihad represents a transfer of the leadership
role to these organizations. The Oslo Accords, together with the public
commitment of Fatah (the largest and most influential of the Palestinian
terrorist organizations) to refrain from acts of terrorism against Israel,
reinforced this process.(1) Other secular Palestinian organizations (e.g.,
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Jibril Front, the
Democratic Front, and groups that have left Fatah) are still attempting
acts of terrorism against Israel, but their relative share of terrorist
attacks today is negligible.

<P>INCREASE IN SUICIDE MISSIONS: WHY?

<P>Since Fatah first began committing acts of terrorism in 1965, there
have been periodic changes in the preferred type of terrorist act. Whereas
at the end of the 1960s the most frequent type was "air terror" (skyjacking),
in the mid-1970’s it was "bargaining" by groups that penetrated Israel’s
borders (overland or from the sea) and took hostages. By the end of the
1980’s against a backdrop of intifada activities, it had become "auto-initiative"
(when a lone assailant would commit terrorism against civilians or security
personnel, usually with a knife or axe). Since the early 1990s, and particularly
recently, the preferred method has been "suicide missions," which by definition
involve the death of the perpetrator. Such acts are usually implemented
by means of a car-bomb, or explosives which the terrorist carries on his
person.

<P>The rise in the number of suicide missions can be attributed to two
factors:

<P>Rise of Islam worldwide. The strength of Islamic fundamentalist groups
has increased in the territories, Lebanon, other Arab countries and elsewhere.
Active members of these organizations are motivated by ideological fervor,
and they are bolstered by their commitment to jihad (the sacred duty of
holy war) and the promise of reward for their acts in the hereafter.

<P>The success of suicide attacks in Lebanon. Hizbullah activity against
the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Lebanon in the early 1980’s led, following
numerous casualties, to the IDF’s withdrawal. This served as proof for
the Palestinian-Islamic organizations that a readiness for self-sacrifice,
determination, and long-term vision, together with the correct use of terrorist
strategies (and with reliance on the influence of the mass media on western
opinion), can lead to far-reaching military and political achievements.
Activists in the Islamic organizations quickly learned that suicide missions
are extremely effective. (A relatively small number of high-impact suicide
missions succeeded in ousting from Lebanon the French, the Americans and
eventually the Israelis.)

<P>The Palestinian-Islamic organizations, relying on a fundamentalist ideology
similar to that of Hizbullah, started to learn and imitate the new terrorist
methods, and preach daring and self-sacrifice in preparation for suicide
missions.

<P>SIMULTANEOUS ACTION AGAINST ISRAEL ON ALL FRONTS

<P>From the day of their establishment, the various terrorist organizations
acted against Israel on all possible fronts: Within the Green Line, in
the territories, across borders, in the air, at sea, and even against Israeli
and Jewish targets overseas. Occasionally, in the wake of a strategic decision
by the terrorist organizations or of actions by the Israeli security forces,
efforts would shift from one arena to another.

<P>Some striking examples of such shifts:

level, in their new relations with many countries, and in their elevated
status at the UN. The focus for terrorist acts thus shifted to border activities,

</TABLE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>II. THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS: HOW WILL IT AFFECT TERRORISM?</FONT>

<P>The peace process aims to bring about a fundamental change in the scope
and characteristics of terrorism against Israel, via conciliation between
Israel and the PLO, eradication of the ideology that motivates the terrorist
organizations, separation of the organizations from their traditional sources
of support and supply in neighboring Arab countries, and the channeling
of differences of opinion and dispute onto the path of political negotiation,
rather than incessant violence.

<P>TERRORIST ACTION WILL INCREASE

<P>A true peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors would remove the
three basic conditions that enabled the terrorist organizations to flourish
over the years: Safe and supportive territory (for organizing and training,
and as jump-off points for their missions), economic and military support,
and diplomatic assistance in the international arena. But it is apparent
today that terrorist acts against Israeli targets will not end in the foreseeable
future, and may even increase. The Islamic and secular Palestinian organizations
who oppose the peace process will maintain their attacks against Israeli
targets in the territories and within the Green Line, using towns in the
Palestinian autonomy as safe havens, and as organizational locations for
their attack teams. (The autonomy territories in the Gaza Strip and in
Judea and Samaria may thus become a suitable alternative to the possible
restriction of "living space" for the terrorist organizations in neighboring
Arab countries.)

<P>THE IDENTITY OF THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT CHANGE

<P>The recent trend of the PLO "mainstream" (Fatah and its satellite organizations)
to refrain from committing acts of terrorism will continue. Their former
share of such acts is shifting to Islamic fundamentalists and Palestinian
groups who oppose the peace process, and by activists who have left Fatah
or who are acting contrary to the organization’s declared position.

<P>THE MOTIVES FOR TERROR WILL NOT DISAPPEAR

<P>Despite the aim of the Israel-PLO agreements to remove the nationalist
motive from terrorism by allowing expression of Palestinian national desires,
as long as Israel de facto holds on to parts of the territories, as long
as the problems of Jerusalem and the refugees are not settled, and before
an independent Palestinian state is founded, the overall Palestinian interest
(cutting across the ideological spectrum) will be to force Israel with
the use of terrorism to expedite its withdrawal from the territories. It
may therefore reasonably be assumed that the Palestinian authorities in
the autonomy areas will prefer to turn a blind eye to terrorist activities,
paying lip service in the form of non-committal public condemnations and
demonstrative acts in the media spotlight. In this way, they can project
the impression that they are taking action to locate the perpetrators and
bring them to justice.(2)

<P>Moreover, no territorial concession on Israel’s part, however far-reaching,
will satisfy the desires of the Islamic fundamentalists. Therefore the
ideological motive for terrorism will not disappear once a permanent arrangement
is finalized with the Palestinians.

<P>Inherent to the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is
a basic and long-term danger: To the extent that the setting up of autonomous
Palestinian areas, and thereafter even the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state, is perceived by the Palestinians as directly attributable
to the long-standing terrorist effort, it will surely serve as an incentive
for extremist groups to continue terrorism. Their goal will be to "liberate
all of the occupied lands" and establish a Palestinian state throughout
Israel, including within the Green Line. Midway through the 1980s, an impression
was created that Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon came as a result of unremitting
pressure from the Shi’ite terrorist organizations, and not as a result
of Israel’s carefully considered, uncoerced interests.

<P>In precisely the same way, a hurried withdrawal from the territories,
or rapid and rash progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process where
the peace is presented as Israel’s overriding need together with a background
of fatigue and erosion of its endurance in the face of terrorism is liable
to be fertile soil for future fundamentalist terror, and lead to the burgeoning
of more extreme offshoots than those we already know.

<P>THE ARENA OF TERROR: AT HOME AND ABROAD

<P>The support provided by Moslem fundamentalist countries (particularly
Iran) for the Palestinian and Shi’ite terrorist organizations that oppose
the peace process actually ensures that in the foreseeable future, terrorism
against Israeli targets and interests will continue in all arenas.

<P>It would be premature to try and predict the dominant arena in the near
future. Although there may be a waning of border incidents (as a result
of the progress being made in Israel’s relations with neighboring states),
it may be assumed that acts of terrorism in the territories, in Jerusalem
and within the Green Line will continue and even escalate (based on the
four parallel routes of passage in south and central Israel that connect
the autonomy regions, and on the relatively free access afforded residents
of the territories to areas of pre-1967 Israel).

<P>It may also be assumed that with the increasing difficulties faced by
the terrorist organizations in perpetrating border attacks, activists from
the fundamentalist organizations living and operating in Arab and other
countries will try to initiate attacks against Israeli interests abroad.
The series of terrorist acts perpetrated against Israeli and Jewish targets
in South America and Britain in July 1994 (which, according to the public
statements of Israeli leaders and security agencies, were committed by
Islamic fundamentalist elements aligned with Iran), indicates that today’s
terrorists and their patrons do not hesitate to commit mass murder in foreign
countries, including leading European states.

<P>Unlike the PLO mainstream (led by Fatah), the Islamic fundamentalist
organizations have no achievements to protect in the arena of international
diplomacy, and therefore do not shy away from committing acts of terror
abroad. On the contrary: As long as such acts do not contradict the policies
or interests of their patrons-the extreme Islamic countries (such as Iran,
Libya, Iraq and Sudan) these acts are likely to improve their image among
like-minded organizations.

<P>Despite the acts of terrorism abroad, it can be assumed that the authorities
of the autonomy will be able to continue their success in the international
arena, since they will not be held responsible for those acts. Furthermore,
the incidents will be presented as a disruption of the political endeavors
of the Palestinian authorities. In fact, their international standing may
even be strengthened.

<P>THE TYPES OF TERROR ACTIONS WILL NOT CHANGE

<P>The current variety of Palestinian and Shi’ite terrorism against Israel
can serve as a basis for assuming that no far-reaching changes in type
of act will occur in the near future. It may well be that the number of
suicide missions will increase, in an attempt to maximize the number of
casualties.

<P>To the extent that Arab and Islamic countries end their hostility towards
Israel and cease their support of terrorist organizations, the terrorists
would be faced with serious erosion of their organizations and perhaps
even economic failure. There would also be a shrinking of infrastructures
and an escalation of types of terrorism that do not require lengthy preparation,
extensive economic resources, complex weaponry, and a firm territorial
base.

"MORALE WARFARE" AGAINST TERRORISM

<P>In formulating an outline for an Israeli anti-terrorism strategy, we
must bear in mind, first and foremost, that terrorism is in fact "morale
warfare": Terrorists know that they are incapable of defeating the military
forces of the country they are fighting, and therefore their thinking is
directed towards the attrition of the civilian population. It is the deliberate
aim of terrorist organizations to undermine the personal security of civilians,
to sow fear and trepidation, and to sap public morale. In this way they
push civilians into pressuring decisionmakers to adopt a policy that will
match the organization’s interests.

<P>In his book Without a Homeland, former Arafat deputy Salah Halaf (a.k.a.
Abu Iyad), writes that terrorist operations carried out by his organization
sought to boost the morale of the Arab masses, to unsettle the enemy, to
force it to live in a state of constant alert and, if possible, to undermine
the economy of Israel. We did not think for one moment that our operations
would endanger the security of the Jewish state..."(3)

<P>The terrorism war is not merely a violent struggle between an army and
irregular forces, but primarily a battle of morale between two populations.
It is the civilian population (on both sides) that bears the brunt of the
battle. The winner is the side that is more successful in reinforcing the
endurance of its population, strengthening it against the burgeoning fears,
bolstering its security, and reassuring it as it bears the onus of the
fight.

<P>This approach requires a reversal in thinking regarding the development
of strategy. The effectiveness of anti-terrorism operations is no longer
to be evaluated based on the scope of damage and number of casualties,
but rather on the cost in morale: To what extent does any given operation
undermine the morale and security of the enemy, and how much can it bolster
the morale and personal safety of the attacking side’s civilian population.
This equation applies to both "players" in the struggle: The terrorists,
for their part, are likely to carry out an operation that will have a small
number of fatalities but because of its daring, the identity of the casualties,
or for other reasons, will leave a deep impression on the public. It might
shock them much more than a different operation that would have caused
even more fatalities. Similarly, comprehensive anti-terrorist operations
that cause extensive damage to terrorist organizations, and perhaps also
great loss of life, are likely to have a milder effect on the morale and
personal security of the terrorists than audacious pinpoint action against
those in the top echelons of the organization.

<P>From this perspective, the government of Israel must heed the public’s
wishes, without spilling over into populism, and while carefully upholding
the laws and values of a democratic regime.

<P>1. Education is critical

<P>The morale warfare aspect of terrorism positions education at the very
foundation of anti-terrorism warfare strategy. The public’s ability to
endure cannot be reinforced merely by demonstrative measures. The civilian
population has to learn to cope with terrorism, with the aid of special
educational programs adapted for various age groups. The aims of such a
program should be to internalize awareness among the civilian population
that terrorism is something that "has to be lived with," yet without accepting
its existence. The program should enable pupils to learn about terrorism,
understand the operational strategy of terrorists, their motives and objectives,
and to discern the true damage caused by acts of terrorism. Education directed
towards familiarity with the phenomenon, in all its aspects, will lower
the level of anxiety and foil one of the terrorists’ principal aims: To
instill fear and undermine the personal security of civilians.

<P>2. Divorcing terrorism from politics

<P>In setting up such an educational program, the political sector must
also play its part in the effort to frustrate the aims of terrorism. Party
leaders must refrain from attaching special importance to terrorist operations
in their public pronouncements. The political fanning of each terrorist
act plays directly into the hands of terrorists, in that it places the
issue at the top of the public agenda. Politicians of all stripes must
demonstrably minimize the value of terrorist acts and emphasize the public’s
ability to deal with them over time. Terrorist operations should not be
used to change the political stance of the public.

<P>3. The Media: Part of the problem or part of the solution?

<P>The third level of morale warfare against terrorism is communication.
The written and electronic media must be included in the campaign. The
question of terrorism and the media is a complex one, but it is well known
today that terrorists make extensive use of the media to spread their message.
The media respond willingly to the terrorists because terrorism "sells
papers." There is an almost symbiotic relationship between the two, in
which both sides profit from the cooperation. The terrorist organizations
recognize the central role of the media, and direct their operations towards
attracting the greatest measure of media attention.

<P>An effective battle on the morale level requires that direct contact
between terrorism and the media be cut off. Since we are dealing with a
democratic state, it would be preferable if a decision imposing restrictions
was taken by the media themselves, if they would impose self-censorship
on the reporting of such events. But if the media are not capable of rising
to the occasion and setting limits, appropriate governmental measures should
be considered for preventing terrorists from using the media to their advantage.
Rules could be made, the likes of which are already in place in some western
countries, such as Britain: A ban on live broadcasting of terrorist acts,
a ban or restriction on the broadcasting or publication of interviews with
terrorists or their leaders, and other similar measures. In this modern
age such steps will not prevent the coverage of terrorist operations around
the world, but they will make it more difficult for these groups to pass
their message on to the civilian population of the affected country, thereby
disrupting their morale warfare strategy.

<P>At the same time, Israel must use the media for disseminating information
against the terrorist organizations. The media have the ability to shape
the civilian population’s thinking and assist in educating it to cope with
terrorism. Carefully considered informational activities will help not
only to boost the public’s morale, but might also clarify Israel’s stance
in the international arena and help neutralize Palestinian propaganda.
At the same time, it would lower the morale of the Palestinian population
by presenting terrorism as an ineffective and hopeless battle plan.

<P>These, then, are the three basic levels of anti-terrorism operations
as morale warfare: Education, politics and the media. In addition, several
other basic principles must be defined to serve as guideposts for anti-terrorism
warfare, as described below.

<P>NO RELEASE OF CONVICTED TERRORIST-MURDERERS

<P>Terrorist organizations place the government in an almost untenable
position: In its effort to save the lives of innocent hostages, the government
faces demands for the release of incarcerated terrorists "with blood on
their hands." But the release itself carries the danger that it will escalate
terrorism, both by the released terrorists and as a reaction of the terrorist
organizations to the success of their ploy.

<P>Various Israeli governments have tried to solve this problem on numerous
occasions, and have in the past even agreed to the mass release of imprisoned
terrorists. The most noteworthy cases were the 76 terrorists released in
1979 in exchange for the freedom of Avraham Amram during the Litani Campaign;
66 terrorists in addition to the 4,500 in Ansar prison in exchange for
the release of six Israeli soldiers taken prisoner by Fatah in Lebanon
in 1983; and 1,150 terrorists in exchange for two soldiers taken prisoner
by the Popular Front-General Command (the organization led by Ahmed Jibril
in Lebanon) in 1985.

<P>The government must adopt a fundamental principle of refusal to release
imprisoned terrorist-murderers, and adhere to it in all situations and
under all conditions. To abide by a resolution of this kind is undoubtedly
difficult, but to do so relentlessly over time eliminates the need to build
resolve each time such a decision is required. Only if the terrorists are
absolutely convinced that the government acts in accordance with basic
principles that will not be violated under any circumstances, will they
change their demands and adapt them to a "tolerable price" that the government
is likely to be prepared to pay for a terrorist operation. On the other
hand, a one-time breach of a basic principle or any relaxing of positions
will automatically lead to additional breaches and bring further blackmailing
pressures to bear.

<P>Despite the emotional difficulty in taking such a decision, concern
for the safety of hostages, and enormous public pressure, Israel must adhere
to this principle in order to guarantee public security now and in the
future. While it is difficult to make cost-benefit evaluations when dealing
with human lives (and especially when the life of a specific person hangs
in the balance), it is important to be aware that the release of terrorists
convicted and imprisoned for their murderous acts is liable to lead to
further extortionist attacks, and the released terrorists are quite likely
(as has been the case in the past) to take part in the initiation, planning
and perpetration of yet more murderous operations, and in the training
of new terrorists. All of this is liable to cause a very large number of
fatalities.

<P>Furthermore, the release of terrorist-murderers who have not yet served
out their sentences has a devastating effect on public morale, and on the
trust placed in Israel’s judicial and political systems. The thought that
a terrorist caught perpetrating a fatal attack will sooner or later be
released, leads many people to believe that it would have been preferable
to kill the terrorist on the spot, even before bringing him to trial (a
line of thinking that is contrary to the basic values of any democratic
country operating under the rule of law).

<P>Another problem is the release of terrorist-murderers as an element
of the peace process. Here it is important to remember that we are not
discussing an exchange of prisoners at the end of a war, but of murderers
who committed a crime on Israeli soil or against Israeli interests. These
terrorists must, by any criteria, serve out their sentences. Other terrorists
must know that there is no pardon for terrorist attacks, and are thus deterred
from perpetrating similar acts.

<P>PRO-ACTIVE MILITARY INITIATIVE

<P>Another question that arises in the formulation of guidelines for Israel’s
anti-terrorist operations is the fear of a boomerang effect that might
occur following aggressive pro-active military initiatives.

<P>More and more, the argument is heard that the rewards of aggressive
action and reprisals against terrorist organizations eventually turn into
losses. Organizations hit by such actions swear to avenge the damage and
losses caused them, and they commit new high-casualty acts. This chain
of events has come to be called the "boomerang effect." The argument often
drawn from this process is that aggressive anti-terrorist action should
not be taken, and that we should make do with security measures, prevention,
and the thwarting of terrorist operations.

<P>But the terrorist organizations are not lacking in motives for their
actions. The factor that determines the scope of attacks is not the existence
or absence of motive, but rather capability: Economic and other resources,
intelligence information, weapons, target accessibility, training, etc.
These factors do not change in the wake of aggressive Israeli action; some
of them (squad training, weaponry, etc.) may even be disrupted by it. The
thirst for vengeance does not affect the capabilities of the terrorist
organization.

<P>Over the years, the terrorist organizations have learned to cite vengeance
as their motive. The presentation of a terrorist attack as revenge for
aggressive Israeli action serves these organizations well, and assists
them in their morale warfare, a kind of "the more you afflict us, the more
we will multiply and grow." But in reality almost all of these attacks
(defined as revenge attacks) would have been perpetrated against Israel
in any case when conditions were favorable. At most, the organization can
expedite a long-planned attack by accelerating the final stage of preparation.

<P>Israel, by refraining from aggressive anti-terrorist action, is liable
to enable the terrorist organizations to organize, consolidate, and increase
their power undisturbed. Instead of being occupied with the defense of
their bases and rehabilitation of the damage caused by Israeli attack (while
constantly fearing for their lives), they have ample time to plan and commit
yet additional terrorist operations.

<P>But above all, aggressive Israeli action is of primary importance on
the morale level. Such action proves to the Israeli public that the initiative
in the anti-terrorist war is in the hands of the government and not those
of the terrorist organizations. The government does not act according to
the pace of terrorist attacks; on the contrary, it sets the pace. Aggressive
action passes a message to the public that there is "law and order," and
that "every terrorist can expect to be hanged." Simultaneously, aggressive
Israeli action eats away at the morale of terrorists and their leaders,
as well as of the abetting population.

<P>Pro-active military initiative, then, is of primary significance in
anti-terrorist warfare. In accordance with this criterion, various measures
can be categorized according to their importance and effectiveness.

<P>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM

<P>Another principle to be integrated into Israel’s anti-terrorism strategy
is the deepening of international cooperation. Terrorism is a worldwide
problem that leaves its mark on most democratic western countries. The
fight against terrorism is a common interest among all of these countries;
cooperation in anti-terrorism warfare would seem to be a necessity. Yet
western countries have not yet learned to join forces. Many of them see
the problem of their internal terrorism as being of primary importance
and are prepared to invest considerable resources in its prevention. But
terrorism perpetrated against other countries is at best considered to
be the internal problem of those countries, and often as the "legitimate
struggle" of an organization to achieve political aims.

<P>Moreover, many countries are fearful of being involved or identified
with the international fight against terrorism, since joint action could
involve them in disputes and problems that do not affect them directly.
The involvement of such countries in international anti-terrorist activities
is liable to hurt their wider international interests, and in some cases
even trigger terrorist attacks on their territory. The outcome is often
conciliation towards states that clearly support terrorism. France heads
the list of such conciliatory countries. Other European states refrain
from imposing sanctions against countries that support international terrorism;
they may even maintain extensive diplomatic and economic relations with
them. One outstanding example is Germany, in its relationship with Iran.

<P>Israel has a strong interest in convincing its friends in the West that
they should join forces against terrorism. Israel must take the initiative
in the international arena, in the UN and at international conventions
and assemblies, to develop bilateral and international cooperation in anti-terrorism
warfare.

<P>One of the key obstacles in anti-terrorism warfare is the absence of
an agreed upon, normative, and binding definition of the term "terrorism."
In the absence of such a definition, no system of international cooperation
can be built. New agreements cannot be reached, and agreements already
signed cannot be put into effect. This is because each party to the agreement
defines terrorism according to its own considerations and interests, enabling
it to evade its international commitments. What this means is that clear
efforts must be made to reach consensus on an objective and universal definition
of "terrorism" that is acceptable to all the countries of the western world.
This definition will constitute the foundation of an international normative
system for anti-terrorism warfare.

<P>STRUGGLE AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT TERRORISM

<P>As long as terrorist organizations have support, assistance and the
sympathy of other countries, the terrorism phenomenon cannot be eradicated
by military means. Western countries choose to turn a blind eye to the
involvement and support of other states for terrorist organizations.

<P>If western countries were to decide to put an end to terrorism, they
would take joint and decisive action against any country that assists or
supports a terrorist organization, as well as against the organizations
themselves. This would lead to the destruction of a considerable part of
these organizations around the world, and to the prevention of many terrorist
attacks.

<P>These are the basic assumptions and principles that ought to guide Israel’s
anti-terrorism strategists. But as noted earlier, Israel is currently in
the midst of a new stage of anti-terrorism warfare. The political process
between Israel and the PLO, together with the establishment of autonomous
areas in Gaza and Jericho, constitute new challenges for Israel in this
field.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>IV. ANTI-TERRORISM AND THE PEACE PROCESS</FONT>

<P>True peace is undoubtedly one of Israel’s vital interests, being likely
to diminish the threat of war and its catastrophic implications. For this
reason, Israel must continue to strive towards achieving peace with all
Arab countries and with the Arabs. But the government of Israel must also
convey to the Palestinian population the message that any readiness on
Israel’s part for concessions or compromises is not the result of the direct
or indirect pressure brought to bear by terrorist attacks, or of the public’s
cumulative weariness from constantly coping with terrorism. If during the
negotiations there is a perception that the Palestinians have made any
gains (territorial, political, economic or other) as a result of terrorist
attacks, there will be a concomitant escalation in the activities of those
terrorist organizations that oppose the peace process, along with the proliferation
of even more violent organizations and factions.

<P>How then can effective and purposeful negotiations be continued, without
allowing the Palestinians to present such continuation as an achievement
of the terrorism campaign that has been waged against Israel for so many
years?

<P>TESTING THE PLO’S WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT TERROR

<P>There must first be an announcement that any progress along the Israeli-PLO
negotiation route will be made in measured and carefully considered steps.
This progress will depend upon the ability of the Palestinian leadership
to prove its success in preventing terrorist attacks against Israel (including
those perpetrated by organizations that oppose the peace process). Recognition
by Israel of the hardships and objective limits that apparently deter the
Palestinian leadership from presenting such proofs, would be catastrophic.

<P>One can hear in Israel quite frequently the argument that "you cannot
demand that the PLO, which has no army, confront the terrorists in Gaza
and Jericho. After all, the IDF, with all its might, was unable to cope
with terrorism when the territory was under Israeli control." This is a
dangerous argument, because it allows the Palestinian leadership to hide
behind so-called "objective difficulties," and it relieves them of any
responsibility for terrorist attacks from the autonomy area, for the organization
of terrorists within the area, or for the escape of terrorists to the autonomous
zone after they commit the attacks.

<P>In the early stages of negotiation and application of agreements for
the transfer of authority in the territories, the government of Israel
cannot ignore the obligation of the PLO leadership in Gaza and Jericho
to thwart terrorist attacks and bring their perpetrators to justice. This
would create an irreversible situation in which Israel would sustain attack
after attack while the PLO watches from the sidelines.

<P>Moreover, claims that the Palestinian leadership is unable to halt the
attacks are incorrect and misleading. True, it does not have regular army
divisions at its disposal, but its control of the Palestinian street in
Gaza and Jericho (as well as in the other areas of the territories) is
far greater than that attained by Israel. Fatah activists and those working
for the Palestinian Authority are naturally rooted in the Palestinian population
of the territories and are aware of the public’s desires, and of the mood
and the activity of the various sectors. The means available to the Palestinian
Police and security forces are supposed to be adequate for foiling attacks,
locating perpetrators and bringing them to justice. If not what is the
purpose of the police and security mechanisms?

<P>FREE AND DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS

<P>The second principle on which Israel must insist in the early stages
of the negotiation process (and which would have been preferable even prior
to the signing of the "Gaza and Jericho First" agreement and official recognition
of the PLO as representative of the Palestinians) is the immediate holding
of free and democratic elections among the Palestinians. Israel needs to
be sure that the "partner" sitting across the table is the Palestinians’
elected representative, and that it represents the majority of the Palestinian
public (including the population in the territories and in the refugee
camps in Arab countries). Its signature on any agreement must be binding
upon the entire Palestinian people, now and in the future.

<P>Israel must conduct negotiations with the elected Palestinian delegation;
it should not matter who its leader is. Thus PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat,
as an elected representative of the Palestinians, is a partner for dialogue
(as Hamas would be if it were elected). But Arafat as head of the Fatah
organization or as chairman of the PLO, who was "elected" by the National
Palestinian Council (most of whose members he appoints), in effect symbolizes
the achievements of the Palestinian "armed struggle" and the defeat of
Israel in its war on terrorism.

<P>In the current situation, any concession or compromise during the negotiations
with the PLO chairman will be interpreted by the Palestinians and their
allies as an Israeli capitulation to terrorism. However, any concession
or compromise during negotiations with the Palestinians’ elected representatives
(chosen in a free general election) would be a gesture and a sign of good
will toward the Palestinian people, on the road to achieving a comprehensive
peace in the region.

<P>Apparently, there is a fear that free Palestinian elections would lead
to the election of a leadership that is close to the Hamas movement and
the destruction of the ongoing peace process. Yet there is no point in
reaching agreement with anyone other than the true representatives of the
Palestinians. It may be assumed that a delegation elected from Hamas would
in the final analysis (following international, intra-Arab and internal
pressure) find the ideological justification for negotiating a regional
political arrangement with Israel. Undoubtedly, negotiations with Hamas
activists are liable to be a difficult and complex proposition. It is preferable,
however, to conduct difficult negotiations with an elected representation
than with an entity the extent of whose influence and legitimacy among
the Palestinians is unclear, and whose signature on agreements with Israel
will not be binding in the future on large sections of the Palestinian
people, or even on a leadership elected at some future date.

<P>IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS OF ALL POINTS OF DISPUTE

<P>In the course of peace negotiations with the Palestinians, solutions
must be sought for every point of dispute, leaving no problem unsolved.
The absence of agreement on issues that today appear marginal will at a
later date be fertile ground for the continued actions of extremist terrorist
organizations. The impact is even greater when we consider fundamental
questions at the root of the conflict.

<P>Among the issues that cannot be ignored, and that must be brought to
the Israeli-Palestinian discussion table, is the question of Israeli Arabs.
They have a special status by virtue of being, on the one hand, citizens
of Israel, and on the other hand, part of the Palestinian people. The negotiations
must examine the demands and desires of Israeli Arabs, reach agreement,
and set fixed rules concerning their position in national-political-territorial
terms. Ignoring this question during the present negotiations is liable
to lead to the eruption of a new "Palestinian problem" in several years’
time, causing the development of new terrorist organizations within pre-1967
Israel. Such questions can and must be immediately dealt with and solved.
Other issues that require early solution are the status of Jerusalem, and
the "Right of Return" of Palestinian refugees to their homes within pre-1967
Israel.

<P>CHANNELS OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ISRAELI OPPOSITION

<P>The Israeli-Palestinian peace process entails taking risks, making difficult
and fateful decisions, breaking conventions, and altering policies. The
implications of decisions made today will impact -for better or worse-on
both present and future generations of Israeli citizens. It is important
that the opposition be made to feel that its positions are being heard
and taken into consideration, although not necessarily used to shape policy.
If all channels of the opposition’s dialogue and influence are blocked,
some of its activists may feel that the government is leading the people
toward the brink, and that they have no way to save the situation.

<P>One possible outcome (as has happened in many countries) could be the
organization of extremists, either to violently force the government to
change its policy, or for them to bring about such a shift in a manner
that will irretrievably disrupt the negotiation process. Such a situation
might well lead to the growth of Jewish underground organizations and even
to civil war. The government must be meticulous in maintaining open dialogue
with the opposition, and in obtaining where necessary as broad a consensus
as possible for its activities and decisions.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>V. SUMMARY</FONT>

<P>Israel is in the process of negotiating with the representatives of
a terrorist organization. If during the negotiations there is a perception
that the Palestinians have achieved anything as a result of terrorism,
there is likely to be a concomitant escalation in terror against Israel.
Thus during this process it is important to follow guidelines that will
prevent the PLO from presenting the negotiations and its outcome as the
result of terror.

<P>The formulation of a new anti-terrorism strategy requires, first and
foremost, a reversal of thinking and a recognition of the centrality of
the morale element in the battle between the Israeli people and the terrorist
organizations. This must include educating the public to be familiar with
the terrorists’ strategy, which will frustrate the achievement of their
goal-the instilling of fear and lack of personal security. The news media
must also be mobilized in the struggle; limiting interviews with terrorists
or their leaders will make it difficult for them to convey their message
to the civilian population, thus disrupting their war of morale.

<P>As an inseparable part of the development of anti-terror strategy, there
must be strict adherence to several basic principles: To begin with, refusal
to release terrorist-murderers serving a life sentence, which must be observed
at all times and under all conditions, since any relaxation will lead to
additional blackmail. Another principle is constant offensive action against
terrorist groups, without fear of any "revenge" that may follow. Israeli
attacks strike a blow at the morale of the terrorists and their leaders,
and of the abetting population.

<P>There is tremendous importance attached to international cooperation
in the war against terrorism. A universal, normative and binding definition
of terrorism should be developed, which will facilitate the development
of a system of international cooperation. The development of this kind
of strategy, together with the adoption of the above principles, will enable
the state of Israel to protect its vital interests.

<P>Notes

<P>1 Since the Oslo Agreement (September 13, 1993), and to a considerably
greater extent since the Washington Agreement (May 4, 1994), there has
been a clearly discernible reduction in the number of acts of terrorism
by Fatah, although they have not ceased entirely. The number of victims
from Fatah acts, however, has risen compared to the period before the Oslo
Agreement (see the Peace Watch reports on compliance with the Israel-PLO
agreement since its signing).

<P>2 In this context it can be presumed that in order to deflect Israeli
and international criticism from the absence of motivation and the lack
of effectiveness of the Palestinian authority in its fight against terrorism,
several public trials will be held for activists involved in acts of terror
who do not belong to a central Palestinian group. The only condition is
that this does not arouse the anger of the fundamentalist organizations.
