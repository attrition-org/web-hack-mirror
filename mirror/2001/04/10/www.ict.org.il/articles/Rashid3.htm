for the Americans</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Yoram Schweitzer</B>
<BR><B>ICT Research Fellow</B>

<P>On 3 June the United States Justice Department announced that Mohammed
Rashid, former member of the 15 May Faction (Abu-Ibrahim Faction) would
stand trial before an American court for terrorist acts against American
passenger planes in the 1980's. The announcement was an impressive culmination
to a 16 yearlong worldwide manhunt, and furnishes yet another indication
of the perseverance of American law enforcement authorities in the fight
against terrorism.

<P>Rashid was a member of a radical Palestinian organization known as the
"15 May Faction" or the "Abu-Ibrahim Faction". The organization began operating
in 1979. Like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - Special
Command (Salim Abu Salem Faction) The 15 May Faction was an independent
offshoot of Wadi' Haddad's terror group, which split upon Hadad's death
from cancer in 1978.

<P><B>The 15 May Faction</B>
<BR>Wadi' Haddad, who was one of the leaders of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (under the leadership of George Habash) split in
1976 and formed a Faction that became the foremost Palestinian organization
in international terrorism in the 1970's. His organization was responsible
for a long list of effective terrorist attacks, among them the Air France
hijacking to Entebbe in 1976, the Lufthansa hijacking to Mogadishu in 1977,
and the kidnapping of the OPEC leaders in Vienna in 1975. The infamous
"Carlos" carried out a number of terrorist attacks as a Haddad operative.

<P>The 15 May Faction continued the tradition for violence and radicalism
of its predecessor. The organization group specialized in the use of sophisticated
suitcase bombs and plastic explosives, and focused on American and Israeli
targets, and in particular means of transportation--ships and planes. The
organization's is charged with the attack on the Greek ship <I>Orion </I>in
Haifa Port (December 1981); attacks on American and Israeli airliners in
the years 1982-83, and attacks on crowded hotels and restaurants for the
purpose of wholesale killing.

<P>From the outset of its existence as an independent organization, May
15 operated out of its bases in Iraq and with Iraqi funding and support.
American pressure on Iraq to restrain the group's activities was only partially
successful--and that only as a result of Iraq's need of American support
in its war with Iran, in the 1980's. From then on the faction suspended
its operations, and its operatives dispersed to other organizations, among
them Yassir Arafat's "Fatah".

<P><B>The Activities of Mohammed Rashid</B>
<BR>Mohammed Rashid, as a veteran operative of the 15 May Faction, was
active in a number of attacks against American and Israeli planes. In August
1982, Rashid, accompanied by his wife and young son, boarded a Pan Am flight
from Japan to Hawaii. They deplaned at a transit stop, leaving behind them
under the passenger seat a bomb with a delayed timer. The device exploded
while the plane was over Honolulu, killing a 15 year-old boy and injuring
15 other passengers. An identical bomb on another Pan Am plane was discovered
in Rio de Janeiro and defused without injury.

<P>Rashid was responsible for another attempted airline attack, this time
on an Israeli plane, at the end of 1983. A sophisticated suitcase bomb,
made by the Abu-Ibrahim Faction was given to a British woman, who acted
as courier to bring the suitcase to Israel, where she checked the suitcase
through to London after deplaning. The device was intended to explode in
mid-flight, causing the plane to crash, but a technical defect prevented
it from going off. Thus a major catastrophe was narrowly averted. Some
7 years later, in September 1990, Fuad Shara, Rashid's accomplice in preparing
the attack, was captured and brought to trial in Israel. He was sentenced
in May 1991 to 25 years in prison.

<P>In the later half of the 1980's, Rashid joined the "Special Operations
Group", one of the terrorist apparatuses of "Fatah", under the command
of Abdullah Abd al-Hamid Labib, alias Colonel Hawari. He was implicated
in the April 1986 bombing of TWA flight over Corinth. The bomb, made of
plastic explosives, exploded en route from Rome to Athens just before landing,
blowing a hole in the right side of the Boeing 727. The result was an immediate
loss of cabin pressure, which sucked out four American passengers, including
an infant. Nine other passengers were injured. Fortunately, the plane was
able to land safely.

<P>On October 20, 1988, a French court convicted Hawari, in absentia, for
his role in several terrorist attacks throughout Western Europe in the
mid-1980s aimed at Syrian, Libyan, and US targets. The court sentenced
him to the maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for complicity in transporting
arms, ammunition and explosives and of "criminal association." The US charged
that Hawari was also behind the TWA attack, but did not indicate whether
he was acting on orders of Yassir Arafat, PLO and Fatah chief. Hawari headed
at the time the Fatah Special Operations Group's intelligence and security
apparatus and sometimes served as Arafat's bodyguard. He reportedly had
used Palestinian terrorists who previously belonged to the May 15 Organization.
Hawari was later killed in a car accident in Iraq.

<P>As a result of a relentless chase on the part of the American authorities,
Rashid was finally captured at Athens International Airport in May of 1988.
However, Greece, apparently fearing terrorist reprisals, refused an American
request for his extradition. After many delays and considerable pressure
from Washington he was tried in Greece and sentenced to 15 years. During
his trial in Athens, Rashid, claimed to be a member of the PLO and the
Palestine Liberation Army. He insisted that his name was Mohammed Hamdan,
the name in his passport. However, the court identified him as Rashid after
Greek police testified that he had been arrested in 1973 for smuggling
hashish in Greece and had served 3 years of a 6-year term. His fingerprints
matched those taken in 1973. During this earlier term in a Greek prison,
he managed to recruit several criminal elements to perpetrate terrorist
attacks on behalf of his organization.

<P>In 1996, after serving only 8 years of his 15-year sentence, despite
all efforts by the U.S. to prevent it, Rashid was released by the Greek
authorities, for "good behavior". Now two years later, and a decade and
a half after the American Justice authorities set themselves the goal of
bringing him to justice, Rashid is finally standing trial before an American
court.

<P><B>U.S. Activities against Terrorism</B>
<BR>The arrest of Rashid is in keeping with long-standing American counter-terrorist
policy implemented by all the U.S. presidents since the 1980's.

<P>The first expression of this policy was the capture of Fuad Younes,
a member of the Shi'ite Amal organization, who was responsible for the
1985 hijacking of a Jordanian plane carrying American citizens. Younes
was caught in 1987, tried in the U.S. and sentenced to an extended term
for terrorist activities.

<P>The U.S. has continued to lead in the fight to bring terrorists to justice,
and has established laws whereby cases involving international terrorism
against American interests or citizens are kept open until the perpetrators
are caught and brought to justice; international boundaries no longer offer
any refuge to terrorists. Rashid's arrest is the latest of a whole string
of successes in this regard over the past few years. For example:
<UL>
<LI>
The capture and trial of Ramzi Yousef, a radical Islamic terrorist responsible
for placing a bomb on a Philippine Airlines plane in December, 1994. Like
Rashid, Yousef deplaned at a transit stop, leaving the bomb to go off on
a later flight. One passenger was killed and a number of others injured.
Following that attack, Yousef planned a series of similar attacks against
scores of American planes, all of which were prevented thanks to the American's
unrelenting pursuit of Yousef, which eventually led to Pakistan's handing
him over to stand trial in the U.S. (February 1995). There he was sentenced
to multiple life sentence(240 years) and fined a large sum for a host of
terrorist activities, including the attack on the World Trade Center in
New York that killed three and injured several hundred people.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The arrest and trial of an Abu Nidal terrorist involved in the November,
1985 hijacking of an Egypt Air plane to Malta, which ended with the deaths
of some 60 people. In 1997, he was sentenced by an American court to life
in prison, after first having been released from prison in Malta at the
request of Libya.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
A Japanese terrorist from the Japanese Red Army Faction, who was involved
in a rocket attack on the American Embassy in Jakarta in July 1986, was
extradited to the U.S.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Mir Aimal Kasi, who carried out an attack on the CIA building in January,
1993, that killed three employees and wounded three others was extradited
to the U.S. and tried in June 1997.</LI>
</UL>
The comprehensive policy of the United States with regard to the fight
against international terrorism has served as a deterrent to nations active
in sponsoring terrorism to refrain from open support of acts of terror.
It has contributed much to the decline in the number of international terrorist
incidents in the past few years. The trial of Rashid, along with the ongoing
pursuit of others involved in terrorist attacks is a major milestone in
excising the cancer of terrorism from the sphere of international relations.
