<p><b>Dr. Ely Karmon</b>
<br><b>ICT</b>
<p><i>This article was published in the <b>Middle East Quarterly</b>, Vol.
VI, No. 2, June 1999 and is reprinted here with permission.</i>
<p>On October 20, 1998, the governments of Turkey and Syria signed the
<a href="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=15">Adana agreement</a>. In
this remarkable document, Damascus not only agreed to recognize the Worker’s
Party of Kurdistan (Partiya Karkerana Kurdistan, or PKK) as a terrorist
organization, but pledged to cease all aid to the PKK and to deport its
leader Abdullah Ocalan from Syria. Even more striking was the fact that
the government of Hafez al-Assad carried out this completely one-sided
agreement—including the clauses concerning Ocalan’s expulsion—even before
the agreement was signed. In other words, the Adana Agreement represents
a total Syrian surrender to Turkish demands. (Ocalan then sought refuge
from many countries, including Italy and Kenya, and in February 1999 ended
up being captured by Turkish forces.)
<p>The stunning success of this bit of maneuvering raises an obvious question:
Could Israel—which has many of the same problems with Assad as do the Turks—also
impose its will on the Syrian dictator in a like fashion? Could Damascus
be compelled to cease its support for Hizballah terrorist and guerrilla
activities against Israel, or to give up its sponsorship of extremist Palestinian
groups? Have the interminable, and now defunct, Israeli-Syrian negotiations
in fact been premised on the wrong assumptions? These questions have special
import now, when, in the aftermath of new casualties in Lebanon, the Israel
public opinion is becoming impatient with the cost of keeping troops in
southern Lebanon. Already leading politicians are calling for Israel’s
unilateral withdrawal.
<p><b>Turkey and Israel - a comparison of Policy</b>
<br>Turkey and Israel have much in common; both are non-Arab, democratic,
Western-oriented states that face violent, often terroristic enemies who
carry out attacks within the national borders. Both countries oppose Islamic
radicalism and regional instability.[1] Further, they both have similar
problems with Syria. Turkey’s relations with Syria have three focal points:
a dispute over the Euphrates River’s water, which Turkey has been increasingly
damning; Syrian support for the PKK; and Syrian irredentist claims over
Hatay province, which the Turks gained from Syria in 1939.[2] Israel has
parallel disputes with Syria over the control of the Jordan River waters;
Syrian support for Hizballah and practically all of the Palestinian terrorist
organizations; and the Syrian claim to the Golan Heights, under Israel
control since 1967.
<p>Until 1995-96, Turkey and Israel had similarly cautious policies toward
what both saw as an extremely tough regime, even with the major difference
that Damascus maintained full diplomatic relations with the former and
a state of war with the latter. “It is almost a truism among Turkish and
non-Turkish analysts,” Malik Mufti affirms, “that Ankara’s foreign policy
has been dominated until now by caution, passivity, and adherence to the
status quo.”[3] Similarly, since 1973, Israeli governments have seen in
Assad the guarantor of a quiet Golan frontier. Thus they did little to
prevent his aggressive policy in Lebanon or his sabotage of negotiations
with the Palestinians.
<p>For years, Ankara tried, to no avail, to coerce Syria through political
and economic pressure to cease supporting the PKK. It signed agreement
after agreement but found that the Syrian regime violated every one of
them. For its part, Jerusalem has relied on a policy of reaching understandings
with Damascus about “red lines” for the Syrian presence in Lebanon and
its support for Hizballah activity in southern Lebanon—only to find that
these too were constantly broken. Turks and Israelis acted mildly in response
to these violations. For example, after officially requesting the extradition
of Ocalan at the beginning of 1996, Ankara did nothing more to express
its displeasure than suspend official contacts with Damascus. Likewise,
in early 1996 Jerusalem responded to the Syrian support for Hizballah and
Hamas terrorism campaigns during the delicate negotiations at Wye Plantation
with nothing more than the cancellation of the talks.
<p>According to Alain Gresh, changes on the Turkish side first took place
in 1996, when several attacks took place in Syria against offices suspected
of sheltering PKK officials; in December a bomb exploded in a bus on the
Damascus-Aleppo route causing eight deaths. Reportedly, the Syrians suspected
a Turkish hand behind the bombing.[4] Beginning in January 1996, the Turkish
government persistently conveyed a series of very tough <a href="../documents/documentdet.cfm?docid=16">demands</a>
to Damascus, with which the Syrians seemingly did not comply. Then, in
September 1998 came the Turkish power play. A severe crisis had developed
in mid-September 1998, when Ankara began a series of political and military
maneuvers. These included the issuing of an ultimatum on the part of Turkish
President S&uuml;leyman Demirel to the effect that if Damascus did not
cease its support of the PKK, the military option would be used.
<p>Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz requested parliamentary consent for a war
with Syria, even though, he said, war was not the desired outcome. In a
rare display of unity, all political parties in Parliament, including the
opposition Islamist party, Fazilet Partisi, approved a declaration calling
on Syria to cease its support to the PKK or be ready to “bear the consequences.”
More remarkable, this tough stance also won support from virtually every
other quarter, including the military, the media, and the public at large,
all of whom had grown increasingly disillusioned with Ankara’s inconclusive
peace overtures to Syria since 1985.[5] The Turks backed up their demands
with high-profile military moves of an unprecedented nature. Pilots flying
reconnaissance sorties along the Syrian border received advance permission
to open fire in the event of any Syrian harassment. Mechanized units took
over border patrols. The army canceled leaves and recalled personnel to
bases of the Second Army, and plans were made to evacuate the families
of Turkish diplomats from Damascus.
<p>At this point, Assad capitulated.
<p>Two immediate questions arise from all this: why did the Turkish authorities
decide to take such resolute action when they did? And why did the Syrians
buckle?
<p>On the first point, many factors apparently contributed to the change
in approach. These include the recent successes of the Turkish army and
security forces in countering the PKK’s activity, significantly weakening
its operational capabilities. At the same time, the PKK seemed to be making
major political advances in Europe. The Turkish military decided to remove
the Islamic Welfare Party from power and reduce Iranian involvement in
their internal affairs as part of the government’s fight against fundamentalist
Islam, and this had implications for Iranian support for the PKK too. The
American missile strikes on Osama bin Ladin’s bases in Afghanistan and
the chemical plant in Sudan just a month earlier gave implicit sanction
for a tough Turkish stance while, the American need for Turkish support
in the Iraqi crisis created favorable conditions for such a stance. And
the dramatic growth in strategic and other ties to Israel, conveniently
to the south of Syria, gave heart to the Turks to take a stand.
<p>To the surprise of most observers, Assad meekly accepted the Turkish
ultimatum. Reasons for this might include these factors: the evident resolve
of a country of 65 million inhabitants, with the second-largest army in
the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO), to use military force; the fear
of a Turkish-Israeli alliance that would find Syria in a two-front war;
and the perception that the PKK had become a liability.
<p><b>Current Israeli Policy</b>
<br>Could the Israelis replicate this Turkish success? Their main quarrel
with Syria concerns southern Lebanon, where Hizballah is waging a guerrilla
and terrorist war against the Israeli army, and frequently fires rockets
at the civilian population in northern Israel. Israeli politicians and
top military brass agree that Damascus is responsible for the provisioning
and sponsorship of Hizballah. But when they propose ways to bring an end
to the deadly attacks and to Israel’s strategic weakness, few of them are
ready to take on the Syrians.
<p>Although the Netanyahu government insisted since coming to office in
June 1996 that Syria is behind the violence in southern Lebanon and that
the Lebanese government is merely its puppet regime, its initiatives have
focused on finding a solution in Beirut. Thus, its first major diplomatic
initiative was to offer an Israeli exit from Lebanon in return for a peace
treaty with Beirut. Known as “Lebanon First,” this idea got precisely nowhere.
<p>In January 1998, the Israeli government pursued the idea of withdrawing
according to its interpretation of U.N. Security Resolution 425, with equally
futile results. The Syrians torpedoed all of Netanyahu’s initiatives for
a host of reasons. To begin with, they saw these as a ruse to disengage
Lebanon from Syrian control, and as a way to release Israel from its Lebanon
agony for nothing in return. They also foresaw the potential loss of a
trump card to play in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.[6]
<p>As the casualties in Lebanon continue year after year, Israelis are
increasingly impatient with the situation there and seek a new approach.
Interestingly, views on this subject tend to cross the usual political
and ideological lines. Three main schools of thought exist: continue the
status quo (in the hopes of a comprehensive agreement with Damascus); unilateral
withdrawal, either all at once or in stages; or a punitive policy directed
primarily against the Lebanese economic infrastructure and possibly Syrian
targets in Lebanon. Note that none of these resemble the Turkish approach
of dealing directly with Damascus.
<p><i>Status quo</i>. Prior to the May 17<sup>th</sup> elections, the key
political leaders (Prime Minister Netanyahu, and opposition leaders Ehud
Barak of Labor and Mordechai of the new Centrist Party) maintain that the
status quo must be continued until the moment arrives for real negotiations
with the Syrians. This means, in effect, accepting that Israel must pay
the price of constantly losing soldiers in southern Lebanon. Barak went
further and publicly promised “to bring back the boys” from Lebanon within
a year of his election as Prime Minister, and to achieve a peace agreement
with Syria with all that it implies.[7] Mordechai said he would strive
to reach a “reasonable compromise” with Israel’s neighbors, adding that
he and his colleagues support the idea of “territorial compromise” on the
Golan Heights and an agreement on Lebanon to be reached in talks with Syria.[8]
Netanyahu also promised to bring peace with Syria and solve quickly the
South Lebanon problem if he were elected, without explaining exactly how
he would do this.[9]
<p>Netanyahu declared indeed that his government—as opposed to the Labor
government—was “working on a logical solution to bring about a responsible
pullout from Lebanon, not at any price, of course; including not at the
price of handing over all of the Golan Heights, which the Labor Party was
willing to give the Syrians.” Barak, who negotiated last year with Netanyahu
on forming a unity government, said that Netanyahu’s positions on the issue
of the Golan Heights are soft; he even warned the residents of the Golan
Heights that they should not trust him, hinting for the first time publicly
at what had already been leaked to the press from secret negotiations:
that he and Netanyahu have similar views about the need to withdraw from
the Golan.[10] More recently, during the first television debate with Netanyahu,
Mordechai also hinted at the PM’s real policy. According to sources close
to Mordechai, Netanyahu sent a message to Assad proposing a retreat from
the Golan if early-warning stations could be left on the Heights.[11]
<p>The military establishment generally endorses the status-quo approach.
As a senior security source says, “the Israeli public must understand that
the price of keeping Katzrin [a town on the Golan Heights] is thirty dead
soldiers every year in Lebanon.”[12] It sees unilateral withdrawal from
Lebanon as too risky, even if it is in stages as suggested by Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon and other ministers. Nor does it support waging war against
the Lebanese economy, on the grounds that this would not change the strategic
situation.
<p><i>Unilateral withdrawal</i>. This approach has made major gains in
the past year, thanks in part to the activism of the Four Mothers movement.
The movement developed spontaneously in the aftermath of a helicopter accident
en route to southern Lebanon in February 1997, killing seventy-three soldiers.
Politicians favoring unilateral withdrawal, such as Labor MK Yossi Beilin
and Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani of the Third Way, argue
that Israel can deter attacks from Lebanon just as well from its own side
of the international border as it can from the “security zone” it maintains
in southern Lebanon. A growing number of voices in the military oppose
the present stalemate and support a unilateral withdrawal. According to
some reports, in the wake of the latest declarations of Netanyahu, Barak
and Mordechai, the army has begun preparing for withdrawal.[13]
<p>Proponents of this approach claim that Hizballah has no real interest
in continuing its guerrilla war once it gets Israeli troops out of southern
Lebanon. Despite occasional pronouncements to the contrary, they say, Hizballah
never intended to liberate Palestine but only to advance the domestic social
and political goals of its Shi`a constituency. They note that in fifteen
years of fighting, Hizballah commandos have never once attempted to cross
the Lebanese border into Israel.[14] Advocates of this approach point out
that— should Hizballah misbehave—the withdrawal of troops does not preclude
forceful Israeli action against Lebanon’s infrastructure, the Syrian-Iranian
supply network, or other steps. They also point out that Israel’s departure
from Lebanon changes the rules of the game; Assad and his allies can no
longer justify the Syrian occupation of Lebanon on the grounds that the
Israeli occupiers are there and must be confronted.[15]
<p>Opponents of a unilateral withdrawal argue that Syria would continue
to encourage guerrilla attacks, but now on Israel proper, as a way to force
the Israeli government to resume negotiations over the Golan Heights. And,
they say, Hizballah would happily play this role, given its own interest
in eliminating Israel and liberating Jerusalem. They also note that Israeli
forces in fact could not reenter Lebanon at will on being attacked. Further,
the South Lebanese Army (SLA) would collapse once the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) leave southern Lebanon, meaning Israel would lose whatever support
it has among the civilian population. Finally, unilateral withdrawal signals
that Hizballah had successfully broken Israeli public opinion—encouraging
Hamas and other Palestinian extremists to step up terrorist attacks on
Israeli targets.
<p>Ariel Sharon, supported in the cabinet by Kahalani, proposed a variant
of this unilateral pullback; a withdrawal by stages. His intention was
to enable Israel to observe the Lebanese army’s ability and willingness
to take control of outposts vacated by the IDF, making it possible to gauge
the intentions of Hizballah and the Lebanese government before the withdrawal
becomes a <i>fait accompli</i>.[16] Critics say that Damascus would not
be satisfied and would find other ways to press Israel to yield the Golan.
Also, in addition to the other shortcomings of full unilateral withdrawal,
gradual withdrawal “completely ignores the SLA, which cast its lot with
Israel years ago, as well as the thousands of Lebanese families associated
with thSLA. While unilateral withdrawal entails an orderly departure from
Lebanon, withdrawal in stages would be a disorderly departure akin to running
away.”[17]
<p><i>Military action against Lebanese targets</i>. Few politicians support
this option, which resembles the main thrust of the Grapes of Wrath operation
in 1996. It is very difficult to hit Hizballah targets, for these are often
concealed in schools, clinics, and mosques. And what good would this do?
To Kahalani’s proposal that Israeli planes knock out the Beirut electricity
grid, the military establishment replies that this would unleash a barrage
of Katyusha rockets on northern Israel, resolving nothing, as in years
past.
<p><b>The Turkish Option</b>
<br>The one approach the government has not tried is the one that conforms
with its own argument that Syria and Lebanon are inextricably linked; tell
the Syrians to stop the violence coming out of Lebanon, or else. Israel’s
leaders agree that Syria is behind the attacks on their country from Lebanon.
And yet they also agree, tacitly, not to advocate operational steps to
force Damascus to stop what it is doing.
<p>A different approach has been alluded to occasionally. Uzi Landau, the
Likud chairman of the parliament’s Security and Foreign Affairs Committee,
has called for Israel to adopt the “Turkish model.” Earlier, he proposed
the bombing of Lebanese strategic and infrastructure targets, and only
more recently has he also included Syrian interests in Lebanon. Moshe Arens,
the new Defense Minister, before coming to office found it amazing that
the Syrians could sponsor Hizballah attacks against Israel with impunity
and despaired of his country’s fortitude.
<p>Israel doesn’t seem to have the stamina for this kind of war, and doesn’t
seem to have the sense to change the rules of engagement. This perception
is a clear invitation for the escalation in Hizballah violence against
Israel. As long as we insist on fighting shadows, the Syrians will continue
to seem invulnerable.[18]
<p>Once he became Defense Minister, however Arens dismissed the idea of
embarking on a major military operation in Lebanon, but says he has not
made up his mind yet what to do.[19] Reports indicate that more military
voices are asking for military pressure on Syria.[20]
<p>Efraim Inbar, director of Bar-Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for
Strategic Studies, is a rare voice calling for a tough approach, saying
that Ankara has a clear understanding of the Middle Eastern rules of the
game. He argues that the IDF should end the cost-free Syrian support of
Hizballah by hitting Syrian targets in Lebanon.[21]
<p>Opponents to “muscled diplomacy” mainly fear that the military option
in Lebanon will lead to a full-scale war with Syria, a development unacceptable
to the majority of the public opinion in Israel, which is eager to achieve
a peace agreement with Syria. For its part, the army sees operations against
Syrian targets as too dangerous.[22] During the Turkish-Syrian crisis,
it bears noting, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai emphatically declared
that Israel had nothing to do with Turkey’s military move. He even canceled
several military exercise on the Golan in order to calm Syrian fears.
<p><b>Arab Reactions</b>
<br>Should Israel take the fateful step of threatening Syrian targets until
the violence on its northern border ceases? Here are some considerations
toward a reply:
<p>To begin with, it is risky to think Hizballah will stop the attacks
if Israeli troops withdraw. Hizballah’s main goal is to transform Lebanon
into an Islamic state ruled by the <i>Shari’a</i> (Islamic sacred law).
The difficulty of achieving this goal makes of the fight against Israel
a means both to advance its Islamic credentials and to help its Syrian
and Iranian sponsors. The war against Israel is defined as an important
objective by the organization’s February 1985 <u>covenant</u>.[23] According
to Martin Kramer, director of the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel-Aviv University,
and a leading specialist on Hizballah, the organization would most likely
take advantage of a power vacuum in the south to attack Israel and to test
Israel’s resolve.[24] Indeed, Hizballah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah
has maintained a carefully ambiguous position about his intentions. He
says that Syria, Lebanon, and Hizballah cannot grant Israel security guarantees
after it withdraws and hints that Palestinian cells would infiltrate the
border to strike at Israeli targets. This may well be a hint of possible
methods to be used to fight Israel post-withdrawal.[25] Recently he declared,
“Hizballah will continue its fight until the conquest of Palestine, from
the Jordan River to the sea.”[26]
<p>It also bears remembering that even if Hizbullah has not sent commandos
across the border, it has twice tried to infiltrate terrorists from abroad
to perpetrate terrorist attacks in Israel. Muhammad Hussein Mikdad, a Lebanese
Shi’i, went to Israel in April 1996 (disguised as a Briton named Andrew
Newman) with the intention of detonating a bomb in Jerusalem. And a German
convert to Islam, Steven Smirek, tried to carry out acts of terror in Tel
Aviv in December 1997.
<p>Second, by analyzing Israel’s actions, Assad probably concludes that
Syria has little to fear from the Jewish state in the near future. Should
he accept restarting the negotiations without pre-conditions, Hizballah
and the rejectionist Palestinian groups provide him with a powerful tool
which he will assuredly use. As Moshe Zak, the well-known Israeli commentator,
puts it, “Assad knows no mercy; he only recognizes interests.”[27] Further,
according to Abbas Kelidar, then an adviser to Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan,
“Assad was never truly on the ‘brink’ of peace.” Rather, he “wants to appear
engaged in the peace process to improve [Syria’s] position in the region—that
is, to maintain the Cairo-Riyadh-Damascus axis. Syria also believes that
its engagement in the peace process will be rewarded with international
goodwill.”[28]
<p>Third, according to Ze’ev Schiff, even if the Syrians’ position appears
to have weakened, they can still cause a considerable amount of strategic
damage. Therefore, Israel should exercise care when assessing a possible
Syrian reaction to its military operations.[29] Keeping this admonition
in mind, what are the likely responses to Israeli sword rattling? For one
thing, such action may heighten the terrorist activities of Hizballah and
Hamas, neither of which needs much incentive to go after Israelis. But
how effective Hamas would be depends in large part on whether or not the
Palestinian Authority is willing to clamp down on the organization. Israeli
military actions or threats could in addition impel Hizballah to perpetrate
a new wave of international terrorism.
<p>Alternatively, the Syrians could make trouble for Israel indirectly,
for example, by destabilizing Jordan, no doubt a particularly tempting
target at this moment of transition with the young King Abdallah II still
feeling his way forward. The Iranian option seems problematic. Tehran can
do little more for Hizballah than it already does; and significant military
support for Syria does not seem credible. The Iraqi card could be more
potent, as improvement in relations between the two countries has been
considerable. This improvement has been at the expense of Syrian relations
with the United States, as highlighted by the anti-American demonstrations
in Damascus after Operation Desert Fox, which led to an assault on the
U.S. embassy there.[30] That said, it is not clear what impoverished and
weakened Iraq can to do help Syria that is worth the active hostility of
Washington.
<p>More broadly, heightened tensions between Israel and Syria would quickly
translate into tensions between Israel and other Arab states and with Egypt
and Jordan in particular. The Egyptians have already reacted strongly to
the signing of Turkish-Israeli agreements and could well see the two states
being engaged in an anti-Arab conspiracy.
<p><b>Israeli Constraints and Leverage</b>
<br>Israel would need to deploy an intensive diplomatic and propaganda
effort to explain its position to the West. This means explaining that
the American polfavoring decisive action against states sponsoring terrorism
means not letting Syria continue to get away with its criminal actions.
Syria should not receive a prize for her illegal occupation of Lebanon
nor for its use of Lebanese territory to wage a proxy terror war against
Israel. As the State Department itself has declared, “Terrorism of any
sort is unacceptable and the international community must be committed
to seeing that justice is done.”[31] Jerusalem might also note that Syria
(and Hizballah) has not yet paid for the killing of American Marines and
French troops in 1983 in Beirut, nor for assistance to Palestinian groups
in sabotaging the peace process in 1995 and 1996, much less for the 1998
mob attacks against the American embassy in Damascus. In addition, Israel
cannot accuse the Palestinian Authority of not stopping terrorism while
ignoring the Syrian abuses.
<p>The Israeli government will also have to take into consideration the
mood of its own public opinion, wary of the events in Lebanon and the difficult
and painful peace process with the Palestinians. It will have to convince
the Israeli people that the present situation is no longer acceptable.
The Israeli public must be convinced that the way to the achievement of
a withdrawal from Lebanon—and a fair and lasting peace with Syria—lies
through a test of force with the Syrian regime, responsible for the bloodshed
and the impasse in the peace process.
<p>Most of the political and strategic factors that permitted the Turks
to prevail over Assad will probably also work for Israel:
<ul>
<li>
The strategic position of Syria, surrounded by hostile countries, and all
the weaker after its crisis with Turkey.[32]</li>

<li>
The decay of the Syrian military in the years since the end of the USSR;
the Syrian military is nothing like the kind of force it was in the 1980s.</li>

<li>
Apprehensions in Damascus about Turkish-Israeli coordination.</li>

<li>
The weakening of Iran, Syria’s sole strategic partner and the main sponsor
of Hizbullah.</li>

<li>
The acute and growing succession issue in Syria that leaves Assad in need
of stability to “enthrone” his son Bashar.</li>

<li>
Assad may have nerves of steel but his capitulation to Ankara shows that
he knows when to retreat.</li>
</ul>
<b>In Favor of a New Policy</b>
<br>All in all, a Turkish-style military option appears to be the last
resort to break the stalemate and bring about a change in Syrian policy,
assuming that Assad sticks to his die-hard position. The time has come
for Israel not just to draw “red lines” in Lebanon but to stand by them
and conduct the negotiations from the position of strength it actually
enjoys. As Efraim Inbar has remarked, successive Israeli governments have
failed to realize what the Turkish government has proven; that Syria is
susceptible to military pressure and that such pressure need not necessarily
lead to a full-scale war.[33]
<p>The new Israeli government elected in the May elections should clearly
and publicly express its desire to arrive rapidly at a full peace agreement
with Syria, which could include the total withdrawal from the Golan and
from South Lebanon, under conditions to be decided at the negotiation table.
Israel must not repeat the mistake of giving Syria a free hand to use terrorism
from Lebanon to reinforce its diplomatic position. The government should
declare (1) that Syria will be held responsible for any guerrilla or terrorist
activity against Israel in southern Lebanon and (2) that Damascus must
close all facilities used by groups that use terror against Israel in territory
under its control.[34] To prevent Syrian misunderstanding of Israeli resolve,
military activity in Lebanon should be accompanied by an alert and the
deployment of IDF troops to be ready for any escalation in Lebanon or along
the Golan front.
<p>If this does not suffice, and terrorist attacks continue, Israel must
be ready to use military force. Air attacks against Hizballah and Palestinian
targets in Lebanon must follow, as well as their headquarters in the Beirut
area. Syrian intervention, or even an anti-aerial threat, should be accompanied
by the immediate destruction of its batteries (along the lines of the U.S.
and allied bombings in Iraq and Serbia). If this still does not suffice,
larger scale air attacks against the Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon
will have to follow. Syria has vast strategic, political and economic stakes
in Lebanon and some 35,000 soldiers stationed there. Were Israel to attack
and destroy this presence, it would deal a critical blow to Syrian power
and regional status. Clearly, Israel must also be ready for the possibility
that Syria will enlarge the conflict to the Golan and will threaten a full
scale war, in which case Israel should stand by its policy to the end.
<p>In all likelihood, the Turkish experience implies that the threat of
force will be sufficient to win a favorable change in Damascus, without
having to resort to violence. Even a dovish Israeli political analyst who
supports the unilateral withdrawal, such as Yoel Marcus, recognizes that
Assad is less composed than he appears. With a weak army whose equipment
is antiquated, Assad is in no hurry to plunge into a direct military confrontation
with Israel.[35] Therefore the probability of Syria going to war with Israel
over the clash on its continuous terrorist policy seems low.
<p>The Israeli government’s policy toward Syria has been extremely cautious
and conservative for almost three decades. It has not coped well with President
Assad’s skillful and immoral use of terrorism in Lebanon, a clever policy
that has caused Israel no end of heartache. It now has the right and the
duty to make use of every option, even the military one, to insure its
legitimate interests and the security and welfare of its people’s.
