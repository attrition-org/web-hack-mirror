<br>Round Two</h2></center>

<p><p><img SRC="../graphics/symbols4.gif" height=143 width=200 align=RIGHT>In the final
days of December 1998 yet another aggressive interview with the Saudi millionaire
Osama bin Ladin was published in the paper <i>al-Shara al-Aswat</i>, to
no ones great surprise. Bin Ladin once more called on his Muslim brothers
to renew their attacks upon the enemies of Islam—first and foremost the
United States and Israel. These two represent, in his view, the Crusader-Jewish
pact at the root of an anti-Islamic campaign aimed at humbling and conquering
Islam. Bin Ladin’s caustic verbal attack was expected in the light of the
American strikes in Iraq of December 18-20, ’98. This was not the first
time that he used hostilities between the U.S. and Iraq as an excuse to
condemn the Americans for a “massacre of the Iraqi Muslims.”
<p>The initial conflict between bin Ladin and the United States began at
his own behest at the beginning of the ‘90s, when he “discovered” that
the U.S. “replaced” the Soviet Union in the role of the enemy trying to
conquer Muslim lands. Bin Ladin, who for a decade (1979-89) fought with
the Afghan Mujehadin to oust the Soviet army from Afghanistan now turned
his attention to ousting the Americans from the Gulf region, where they
had stationed themselves in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He
clothed this conflict in the guise of a “jihad” for the liberation of the
holiest places of Islam—Mecca and Medina—from the subjugation of the Crusader
conquest.
<p>Throughout the ‘90s bin Ladin worked to spin around himself a web of
terrorist organizations, predominantly the centers of the various “Afghan
veterans.” He also established a terrorist organization of his own called
“el-Qa’idah,” comprised of several hundred of his devotees. He also initiated
an umbrella organization, which unites the heads of terrorist organizations
in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt. In addition, bin Ladin established links
to a whole list of fundamentalist organizations. The common factor in all
these groups is the use of terrorism for the attainment of their political
goals, and an agenda whose main priority is the overthrow of the “heretic
governments” in their respective countries and the establishment of Islamic
governments based on the rule of “Shariah.”
<p>Last year, the clash between bin Ladin and the United States passed
from verbal sparring to armed conflict. Hostilities reached an all-time
peak with the bombings—carried out by bin Ladin’s organization el-Qa’idah—of
the American embassies in Nairobi and in Dar es-Sala’am in August, 1998.
In total, 224 people were killed and around 5,000 wounded.
<p>These attacks were the catalyst for the launching of an offensive lead
by the United States against bin Ladin and his cohorts, in the course of
which, the U.S. attacked five camps belonging to el-Qa’idah in Afghanistan,
and a factory for the manufacture of chemical weapons in Sudan (August
20). At the same time, the U.S. joined forces with the security forces
of other countries around the world—a cooperative effort that brought about
the arrest of bin Ladin’s operatives in Uganda, Italy, Azerbeijan, England,
and Germany. In these last two countries, those arrested were from the
upper echelons of el-Qa’idah. September ’98 saw the arrest of Khaled Fuaz,
bin Ladin’s official representative in England, as well as the arrest in
Germany of Mamduh Salim, a senior procurer for al-Qa’idah. Mamduh Salim
was extradited to the United States on December 24, and Khaled Fuaz is
awaiting the completion of extradition formalities. Another senior operative,
Wahdi al-Hage was arrested in Texas. Al-Hage served as the head of the
cell that laid the groundwork for the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, upon
completion of which he moved to the U.S. where he lived since 1997.
<p>The American punitive measures have served to intensify its conflict
with bin Ladin and his colleagues. It can be assumed that bin Ladin’s motivation
to carry out revenge attacks against the United States is high. What’s
more, his capacity to react to the preventive measures taken by the U.S.
and it coalition partners has not been significantly impaired, despite
the strikes he has absorbed in the past few months.
<p>The direct conflict between bin Ladin and his Western rivals has escalated
in the wake of the duel that commenced in August 98. This conflict will
more than likely result in yet more massive terrorist attacks by al-Qa’idah,
or even by the terrorist organizations affiliated with bin Ladin, such
as the Egyptian Jihad group and al-Jama’ah al-Islamiyyah, the Indian Harakat
al-Ansar, the Philippine Abu Sayyaf, and others.
<p>In an interview with TIME magazine at the beginning of 1999, bin Ladin
proclaimed his intention to intensify efforts to obtain non-conventional
weapons. He justified these efforts with the argument that “Acquiring weapons
for the defense of Muslims is a religious duty. And if I seek to acquire
these weapons, I am carrying out a duty,” adding, “It would be a sin for
Muslims not to try to possess the weapons that would prevent the infidels
from inflicting harm on Muslims.”
<p>Bin Ladin’s efforts to obtain non-conventional weapons, in particular,
biological and chemical weapons, were amply documented in the past. The
U.S. justified its attack on the al-Shifra pharmaceuticals plant in Khartoum
last August on the grounds that the factory was manufacturing a component
in chemical weapons for bin Ladin.
<p>The combination of a radical worldview, that sees the conflict as a
zero-sum game, supported by scriptural decree, together with proven conventional
capabilities, plus the potential non-conventional capabilities—all this
is what makes bin Ladin’s vendetta against the Western world all the more
dangerous. Added to this is bin Ladin’s total lack of reticence to use
such means at the cost of massive casualties among his rivals and even
his own people.
<p>The frequency of his verbal outbursts and threats in the past few weeks
is reminiscent of a similar build-up prior to the embassy bombings in East
Africa. The recent public statements could hint that bin Ladin already
has a revenge attack up his sleeve.
