<p><p>In the history of the Indian civil
aviation, there have been 13 hijackings (including the latest to Kandahar),
all involving the Indian Airlines (IA) aircraft. Seven of these were carried
out by groups with known links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence
(ISI) and the other six by groups or individuals with no such links.
<p>Of the seven ISI-linked groups,
six were indigenous (Sikh and Kashmiri terrorists) and the seventh (the
latest) is a Pakistan-based Islamic Jihadi terrorist group, which has been
active in the Philippines, Myanmar, India, the Central Asian Republics,
the Xinjiang province of China and Chechnya and Dagestan in Russia, and
which claims to have trained a small group of Afro-American citizens of
the US in the past.
<p>The fact that ISI-linked groups
generally hijack only IA and not Air India flights is due to the fact that
during their training in Pakistan, they are instructed by the ISI to avoid
Air India flights, which are likely to contain a large number of foreigners.
This could create problems for Pakistan with Western Governments and their
intelligence agencies might focus their investigation on the Pakistani
involvement.
<p>On January 30,1971, brothers Hashim
and Ashraf Quereshi of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Liberation Front, armed
with a pistol and a hand grenade, hijacked Ganga, a Fokker Friendship aircraft
of the Indian Airlines (IA), after it had taken off from Srinagar for Jammu
and forced the pilot to take it to Lahore.
<p>After the aircraft had landed, Zuklfiquar
Ali Bhutto, then Foreign Minister under Yahya Khan, rushed to Lahore, fraternised
with the hijackers and helped them get maximum international publicity
for their cause. On February 1, he persuaded them to release the crew and
passengers who were sent by road to Amritsar.
<p>The Government of India sought the
permission of the Pakistani authorities to send a replacement crew to fly
the aircraft back to India. The ISI handed over to the hijackers explosives
with which they blew up the aircraft the next day.
<p>On February 4, in retaliation, Indira
Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, banned all Pakistani civil and military
overflights through Indian airspace, which remained in force till the normalisation
of relations after the Shimla Agreement. The consequent aggravation of
the logistic difficulties of the Pakistan army in the then East Pakistan
partly contributed to its debacle in its war with India in December 1971.
<p>The Dal Khalsa, a Sikh extremist
group that came into being in the late 1970s, took to hijacking as a weapon
of intimidation in 1981. Between September 29,1981, and August 24, 1984,
it hijacked four IA aircraft and took them to Lahore. The hijackers of
September 29,1981, were overpowered by Pakistani commandos and the released
passengers, crew and aircraft returned to India.
<p>The Zia-ul-Haq regime turned down
the request of the Govt. of India to hand over the hijackers to India for
trial and said they would be tried before a Pakistani court. Instead of
doing so, it allowed the hijackers to live in the Nankana Sahib gurudwara
at Lahore, from where they were directing the terrorist activities of the
Dal Khalsa in Punjab. The Govt. of India repeatedly brought this to the
notice of the US, but Washington was reluctant to act against the Zia regime,
which had started playing an important role for the US in Afghanistan.
<p>However, in 1982, the Zia regime
refused permission to two hijacked planes to land in Lahore and forced
them back to Amritsar, where the hijacking was terminated by the Indian
authorities.
<p>Dr.Jagjit Singh Chauhan of the so-called
Khalistan movement based in London, and Ganga Singh Dhillon of the Washington-based
Nankana Sahib Foundation, who was a close personal friend of Zia, strongly
protested to Zia over the refusal of permission.
<p>When a fourth IA plane was hijacked
by the Sikh terrorists to Lahore on August 24,1984, Zia, therefore, ordered
the ISI to permit it to land, help the hijackers to meet the media and
then persuade them to go away to Dubai. The ISI found that the hijackers
had intimidated the pilot only with a toy pistol. They, therefore, gave
them a German pistol with ammunition.
<p>After terminating the hijacking
at Dubai, the local authorities handed over to the Indian officials the
hijackers and the pistol given to them at Lahore.The Govt. of India referred
the pistol to the West German authorities, who replied in writing that
the pistol, manufactured in Germany, was part of a consignment sold to
the Pakistan Government by the German manufacturers.
<p>The Govt. of India brought this
German report to the notice of Washington and sought action against the
Zia regime. Under US pressure, Zia ordered the removal of the Dal Khalsa
hijackers from the Nankana Sahib to the Lahore jail. They were tried and
sentenced to imprisonment, on completion of which expelled from Pakistan.
Thereafter, there was no ISI-inspired hijacking till Gen.Pervez Musharraf
seized power on October 12,1999.
<p>In 1992, the Narasimha Rao Government
shared with Washington a wealth of evidence gathered by the Indian agencies
regarding Pakistani State sponsorship of terrorism in India and urged that
Pakistan should be declared a State sponsor of terrorism under the US laws
and economic sanctions imposed against it.
<p>Washington expressed its inability
to act on the basis of Indian evidence on the ground that most of it was
circumstantial and not direct and that much of it was based on interrogation
reports, which, in the eyes of the US law, are suspect unless independently
corroborated by documentary or technical evidence.
<p>After the Mumbai blasts of March,
1993, the Narasimha Rao Govt. decided to invite the counter-terrorism experts
of the US and other Western countries to visit the spot immediately after
the blasts and make their own examination of the scene of the crime. The
idea was that if their experts concluded that Pakistan was behind the blasts,
even if they did not share this with their Indian counterparts, they would,
at least, go back and tell their political leadership about it.
<p>An Austrian expert, who came to
India, gave in writing that the hand grenades used by the terrorists in
Mumbai while escaping after the blasts had been manufactured in an ordnance
factory of the Pakistan Government with technology and machine tools supplied
by the Austrian company.
<p>The US experts told their Indian
counterparts that a timer found with an unexploded explosive device looked
suspiciously American and wanted to take it to the US for examination.
They were allowed to do so. Later, they sent to New Delhi an unsigned written
report (a non paper) that their examination had established that the timer
was of US-origin and was part of a consignment of timers supplied by the
US army to Pakistan's.
<p>The Govt. of India pointed out that
this was the clinching corroborative evidence, which they had always wanted,
and that, therefore, they should not have any further difficulty in declaring
Pakistan a State-sponsor of terrorism.
<p>US officials expressed their inability
to do so on the ground that there was considerable leakage of arms and
ammunition and explosives from the Pakistan army stocks to smugglers and
that the recovery of this timer in Mumbai did not necessarily mean that
it was given to the terrorists by an official agency of Pakistan. According
to them, to declare a country as a State sponsor of terrorism, conclusive
evidence of the complicity of an official agency and knowledge, if not
approval, of such complicity by the political leadership was essential.
<p>After rejecting the Indian plea,
Washington made its own assessment of ISI involvement in terrorism in India
and forced Mr.Nawaz Sharif, the then Prime Minister, to remove from the
ISI its then Director-General, Lt.Gen.Javed Nasir, and a number of his
senior officers who, Washington believed, had a role in promoting terrorism.
<p>While this action was good in so
far as it went, it did not help the Government of India since their successors
continued to organise terrorist acts in Indian territory. The US action
against the ISI officers, however, resulted in an important change in the
ISI's modus operandi (MO).
<p>Previously, the ISI used to interact
directly with the Sikh, Kashmiri and other terrorist groups from India
and run the training camps for them with the help of serving officers.
Since then, it has been increasingly using private Islamic terrorist organisations
for supplying money and equipment to the terrorists in India and for running
the training camps in Afghan territory, instead of in Pakistani territory.
<p>Among such organisations used by
the ISI are the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM), previously known as the Harkat-ul-Ansar,
which was declared by the US as an international terrorist organisation
in October, 1997, the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Al Badr and Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda. All these organisations are members of bin Laden's International
Islamic Front (also called the International Islamic Salvation Front) for
Jihad Against the US and Israel.
<p>There is the following strong evidence
of the HUM's involvement in the Kandahar hijacking: the only phone call
claiming responsibility came from an Islamic Salvation Front; there were
identical names in the lists of prisoners whose release was demanded by
the phone-caller and by the hijackers; the prisoners, whose release was
demanded, were Pakistani nationals or of Pakistani origin and belonged
to the HUM.
<p>The involvement of the ISI and the
Pakistan army with these organisations and particularly the HUM, would
be evident from the following:
<blockquote>
<li>
These organisations function openly
in Pakistan and their annual conventions are attended by serving officers
of the army and political leaders. They and their leaders address press
conferences, give interviews and issue statements giving details of their
terrorist activities in India and other countries. The Army has not taken
any action against them--not even against the HUM, which has been declared
an international terrorist organisation by the US.</li>

<li>
The investigastion and trial in 1995
by the Benazir Bhutto regime of a group of army officers headed by Major-Gen.Zaheer-ul-Islam
Abbasi arrested on a charge of planning a coup brought out that all the
arrested officers had close links with the HUM. Mr.M.H.Askari , the well-known
Pakistani columnist, wrote in the "Dawn" (October 18,1995) as follows:
" It is said that the plotters had close links with the Hizbul Mujahideen
and the Harkat-ul-Ansar, which are known for their involvement in international
terrorism. It is also said that the arrested officers wanted Pakistan to
become militarily involved in the Kashmir freedom struggle." It was said
that during their interrogation the arrested officers also implicated Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, then a Lt.Gen. and Director-General of Military Operations,
but no action was taken against him for want of evidence.</li>
</blockquote>
The Govt. of India should once again
take up with the US the question of declaring Pakistan a State-sponsor
of Terrorism and with the International Civil Aviation Organisation the
question of advising member-countries to suspend the Pakistan International
Airways flights till Pakistan arrests and hands over the hijackers and
stops such acts of terrorism.
<p>US officials have been repeatedly
rejecting Indian evidence of Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism as circumstantial
and not direct, but in the New York World Trade Centre and Oklahoma bombing
cases, US courts have ruled that in terrorism-related cases conviction
could be based purely on circumstantial evidence, if it was strong enough
and provided a continuous chain of events.
