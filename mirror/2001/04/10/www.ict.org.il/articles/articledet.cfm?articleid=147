<br><i>A Sign that the Peace Process is Moving Ahead</i></h2></center>

<p><br>The arrest of Hamas militants in Amman, the closure of the organization’s
journal and offices in the Jordanian capital, as well as the arrest warrants
issued for the four top Hamas leaders—Khaled Masha’al, Mohammad Nazzal,
Ibrahim Ghosheh and Musa Abu Marzouk—is most likely intended to prevent
the radical Islamic elements from sabotaging the political process between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
<p>According to Israeli sources, the two sides are close to an agreement
for the implementation of the Wye Memorandum, which will permit the withdrawal
of Israeli forces from the territories agreed upon and the beginning of
serious negotiations on the final agreement.
<p>Actually, the way was paved for the Jordanian move back in October 1998
with the signing of the Wye Memorandum. It was clear that Hamas would attempt
to undermine the implementation of the agreements.
<p>The Jordanian newspaper <i>Al-Majd</i> (November 2) reported&nbsp; that
talks between Yasser Arafat and Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, the Jordanian Chief
of Royal Court focused on Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation in the security,
political, and information fields. According to <i>Al-Majd</i>, Arafat
asked al-Tarawinah to curtail the movements of the Hamas leaders in Jordan
and the movement's activities and contacts. Sources said that al-Tarawinah
promised that the Jordanian government would take measures against the
Hamas leaders in Jordan if they attempt to sabotage the Wye Plantation
agreement. Al-Tarawinah also affirmed that the competent Jordanian authorities
had summoned the Hamas leaders in Jordan and asked them not to carry out
any activities against the agreement or encourage such activities.
<p>On November, 2 1998, in the wake of the Wye agreement, the Jordanian
newspaper <i>Al-Hadath</i> reported that Amman Governor Tal’at al-Nawayisah
prohibited Hamas leaders in Jordan from making any statements calling for
the continuation of the armed struggle against Israel or incitement against
the Palestinian Authority. This implied that the relationship between the
Jordanian government and Hamas was heading for a turning point, that the
Jordanian leadership might expel the Hamas leaders from its territory if
they continued to instigate and call for the continuation of the armed
resistance.
<p>But following the signing of the Wye Plantation agreement, the Hamas
leaders in Jordan made passionate statements calling for the continuation
of military operations against Israel.
<p>Ibrahim Ghosheh, spokesman for Hamas, declared in an interview to <i>Al-Urdun</i>
in Amman, on 15 October 1998, that the movement is eager to avoid “the
mutilation of the national fabric ... in the interest of the Palestinian
people.” But, he hinted, “this clear and strong Hamas position, which is
appreciated by foes even before friends, cannot be guarantee forever”—a
veiled threat against the PA if it went ahead with the agreement’s implementation.
“The PA must not continue its present policy and think that Hamas and its
leadership will not respond to agents, who cooperate with Jews and hand
them mujahidin, weapons, and ammunitions,” he said.
<p>However, the policies of the Netanyahu government, followed by its demise
and the election “intermezzo” period in Israel postponed the Israeli withdrawal.
The election of the new government under Barak brought hopes for the achievement
of a real understanding between Israel and the PA and the possibility of
swift progress towards a final settlement.

<p>The prospect of progress in the political process, together with the
formation of a Palestinian state on only part of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, is unacceptable to the Hamas leadership. For this reason, since
the formation of the new Israeli government the movement’s leaders have
expressed support for the continuation of the armed struggle against Israel
and fierce opposition to the PA’s policy, in the hope that the “jihad”
operations will sabotage the process.
<p>According to the radical Islamist newspaper <i>Crescent International</i>,
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas leader in Gaza has made a number of declarations
to the media in which he dismissed the hope for a Middle East peace as
“baseless.” He has declared in no uncertain terms that Hamas will continue
its resistance to the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In
a strong statement issued on the occasion of the Prophet Mohammed’s birthday,
he warned Palestinians of the dangers of ‘normalization’ with Israel and
of reliance on Barak to liberate them. He added that the enemy understands
nothing except the language of force as expressed by a generation founded
on strength, jihad and martyrdom.
<p>In an interview to the French <i>Liberation </i>on July 6, Yassin declared
that there is no alternative to military action and promised that the military
wing would act in the near future to prove that it exists. In another interview,
to <i>Al-Sharq al-Awsat</i> on August 19, Sheikh Yassin stressed that his
movement’s position on military action against Israel was firm and has
not changed because of the continuing Israeli occupation of Palestine.
Regarding claims by some Palestinian security sources about recent military
moves by Hamas, Sheikh Yassin stressed that “The sons of the ‘Izz-al-Din
al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, are the ones who decide when,
how, and where to operate according to the conditions they face and their
resources.”
<p>The Hamas leaders in Jordan have also amply reaffirmed such militant
statements to the Arab and international media. At a meeting in August
with Syrian officials, Hamas political bureau chief Khaled Masha’al said
that Hamas would continue its “jihad, struggle and uprising against the
occupation.” Musa Abu-Marzuq declared in an interview to <i>Filastin Al-Muslimah</i>
that Hamas’ role “lies in clinging to Palestinian rights, in fighting the
enemy, in activating jihad against the enemy in all spheres, and in mobilizing
the Palestinian people, the Arab nation, and the Muslim nation along this
course.”
<p>The Hamas leadership has not contented itself with political declarations,
but has indeed stepped up its military activity, mainly ambushes against
Israeli settlers and army vehicles, and possibly attempts to kidnap Israeli
soldiers. It is also possible that some of the terrorist attacks considered
to be “private” initiatives of Palestinians are due to the intensive indoctrination
and propaganda of Hamas leaders in support of the “popular” jihad against
the “oppressor.” The last in these series of “minor” terrorist attacks
could be the murder of two young Israeli students on the night of August
30 near Megiddo.
<p>Hamas is attempting to extend its influence in the Palestinian refugee
camps in Lebanon, where Fatah’s influence is weak. In this framework it
has formed the “Association of Religious Palestinian Leaders in Lebanon,”
with the blessing of Hizballah’s mentor, Sheikh Fadlallah, and has intensified
its dialog with Hizballah leaders.
<p>At the same time the Hamas leadership has refused to accept a dialog
with the PA in the framework of an united Palestinian front in preparation
for negotiations on the final settlement. This unification has already
received the blessing, in principle, of the George Habbash’s Popular Front
(PFLP) and Nayef Hawatmeh’s Democratic Front (DPFLP).
<p>According to the Jordanian <i>Al-Majd</i> (9 Aug 1999), Khaled Masha’al
was infuriated when he discovered that secret talks with the PA had been
leaked to the press. In fact he did not show any flexibility or moderation
about a proposal to open a national dialogue between the PA and Hamas and
said that Hamas would not be used as a bargaining chip by the PA during
the final-status negotiations.
<p>Hamas has instead proposed, according to the <i>Jordan Times</i> (26
Aug. 1999) the formation of a new umbrella organization, a “national body”
to replace the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which it describes
as obsolete. Hamas is involved in intensive deliberations with Palestinian
opposition factions to form the new organization before the end of this
year.
<p>Hamas leaders have stepped up contacts and visits with their allies
in Lebanon, Syria and Iran, with the intention of forming a united front
against the PA and Israel. Khaled Masha’al met with Syrian Vice President
Abd al-Halim and Foreign Minister Farouk a-Shara to discuss developments
in the peace process and the positions of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
It is not just a coincidence that the arrests and the warrants against
the militants occurred during the visit of these four leaders in Tehran.
<p>Although the Jordanian move was long overdue, and Israel has repeatedly
complained about the relative freedom of Hamas’ leadership in Amman, the
actual measures were taken expressively at the request of the Palestinian
Authority. Jordan has come under increasing pressure from Arafat to take
action against Hamas, which is the Palestinian Authorit’s chief rival and
which has the means and the motivation to sabotage the forthcoming agreements
and the authority of Yasser Arafat.
<p>The following weeks will be crucial for the relations between the PA,
Hamas and Jordan, and will demonstrate whether the radical Islamic organization
will choose the path of all-out conflict with its rivals or will try to
find a political compromise.
