<P><B>Yoram Schweitzer,</B>
<BR><B>ICT Research Fellow</B>

<P>Recent reports concerning the reappearance in an Egyptian hospital of
Sabri el-Bana--better known by his trade name, “Abu-Nidal”--has once more
brought into the spotlight the matter of the many terrorist leaders still
walking around free. It would seem that this time Abu Nidal may not succeed
in eluding his pursuers.

<P>With all the international media attention being focused on Osama bin
Ladin, these days, it should be remembered that Abu Nidal attracted the
same kind of attention ten years ago for his murderous terror activity.

<P>Abu Nidal was for many years the symbol of international terrorism.
His organization, built in his own image, operated under his sole control
and authority. It carreid out indiscriminate attacks against targets of
opportunity, as dictated by political or economic gain, or by order of
Abu Nidal’s patrons of the moment.

<P>The organization’s first activities as an independent entity began in
1973 with its split from Arafat’s Fatah organization, on the background
of personal and ideological disagreements. Sabri al-Bana opposed any deviation
from the way of military struggle against Israel. True to his doctrine
of violence his “Fatah Revolutionary Council” under various assumed names,
perpetrated a long series of spectacular terror attacks. Ironically, for
an organization whose aim is the destruction of Israel, the great majority
of his activity--over fifty percent--was directed against Arab and Palestinian
rivals. His hit list of PLO officials included its representatives in various
western capitals in UK, Italy, Belgium, Greece, France and against some
prominent “pragmatic” figures such as Issam Sirtawi, Saaid Hamami and above
all el Bana’s Bitter opponent, Abu Iyad, Arafat’s second in command.

<P>The official representatives of Arab countries suffered his long murderous
attentions as well. At the top of the list were Jordanians. Between 1983
and 1985, the ANO operated against Jordanian representatives (mainly diplomats)
in India, Turkey, Romania, Greece and Italy. The Gulf States, mainly Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and The United Arab Emirates were attacked because they
were late in paying him protection money--funds exacted in return for the
promise of the ANO to refrain from terrorist activity on their soil or
against their interests abroad. One of these countries paid a heavy price
for defying this demand when ANO blew up a “Gulf Air” airplane, killing
all passengers and crewmembers.

<P>Several times during his career, Abu Nidal switched patron states. Initially
he enjoyed the support Iraq, under whose direction, he carried out terror
attacks against the rival Syrian Baath regime. When Iraq, came under American
pressure during the Iran-Iraq war to end its support of the ANO, Sabri
el Bana evacuated his headquarters and offices and moved to Damascus, whose
officials had only recently been among his victims.

<P>Under the auspices of Syria (from 1983-86) the ANO worked to disrupt
the initial attempts at rapprochement between Israel and some of the Arab
countries, particularly Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians.

<P>The ANO reached its peak in the Mid-Eighties, when his people carried
out several dozen terrorist attacks. Some of these were uniquely lethal,
e.g. the hijacking of “Egypt Air” hijacking to Malta in which 59 people
were killed.

<P>Following the exposure of Syria’s direct involvement in international
terrorism due to the “Hindawi case” (a plan to blow up El AL plane in Heathrow
airport by an unwitting Irish woman under Syrian direction), the ANO had
to pay the price of the Syrian “atonement.” Abu Nidal removed to Libya in 1987.
As one of the predominant state sponsors of international terrorism, Libya
welcomed the ANO with open arms, and quickly found a use for Abu Nidal’s
special skills.

<P>When we filter out attacks against Israeli interests from the list of
the totally of the ANO’s attacks, we find the list to be quite short. Surprisingly,
ANO started to operate against Israeli targets relatively late. Abu Nidal’s
first attacks against Israeli interests were directed at less protected
Jewish targets in Spain, Belgium and Austria (1980-81). His most conspicuous
operation was aimed at the Israeli ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov.
The ambassador was seriously wounded in the attack, which served as the
pretext for the “Peace for Galilee Operation.” Later, the ANO continued
and increased its attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets, such as the
attacks at the Rome &amp; Vienna airports (1985), the attack on the Istanbul
“Neve Shalom” synagogue (September 1986) which resulted in 22 dead and
the failed attack against the Israeli embassy in Cyprus (May 1988).

<P>The sanctions imposed on Libya by the UN Security Council in 1992, as
a result of the Pan Am flight 103 investigation forced Libya to act to
prevent any international activity from being launched by the terrorist
organizations under its auspices--primarily the ANO. This, together with
the outbreak of internal conflicts within the organization--conflicts that
resulted in an estimated couple of hundred casualties--and the desertion
of the same number of members from the organization crippled its ability
to operate as freely as in the past. In recent years the ANO has all but
vanished from the terrorist scene. Abu Nidal’s last operations included
the assassination of a Jordanian diplomat in Lebanon in 1994, the elimination of
two of his own members in Lebanon for embezzlement (1997) and the alleged
assassination of the Egyptian fundamentalist, Sheik Moutaleb in Yemen in
July of this year. The ANO also made a number of public threats against the
Arab participants
of an international economic convention in Abu Dabi attended by an official
Israeli delegation. The ANO was particularly critical of King Hussein’s
role in the rapprochement with Israel.

<P>The ANO’s sharp decrease is more striking against the backdrop of the
sharp rise of the Sunni fundamentalist terrorist organizations on the current
international scene.

<P>However the apprehension of Abu Nidal in Egypt would be an outstanding
achievement in the fight against international terrorism, and must end
with him being tried publicly for the many atrocities for which he was
responsible. This would be a notable addition to other successes in bringing
to trial notorious “fossil terrorists” in recent years. Thus, France brought
Carlos to trial at the end of 1997 for his terrorist activity against its
citizens in 1975. In 1998 the United States succeeded in bringing to trial
Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian terrorist who planted a bomb on a Pan Am
flight in 1982. In Lebanon several “Japanese Red Army” terrorists were
sentenced in 1997.

<P>There is a lesson in all of this, despite this positive trend. Evidently
the ease of capture of these veteran Arch-terrorists was a direct result
of the indifference of the sponsoring states to the fate of their former
charges. Today the states that sponsor terrorism have adopted other, more
fashionable terror organizations and leaders (such as Bin Ladin and his
associates). It’s all a matter of the changing interests on the part of
the sponsoring states.

<P>If the Western world--under the leadership of the United States--is
to effectively combat international terrorism, it must unite in an international
coalition and act in cooperation to force the sponsoring states to withdraw
their active support of terrorists. Among the possible steps that can be
taken are concrete actions such as the arrest and expulsion of terrorists
from their “safe heavens” and their extradition to their home countries
or to states where they carried out their attacks. The Western countries
must if necessary threaten to impose international sanctions on those states
that defy such steps--as was done in the case of Libya after the investigation
into the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster implicated its agents in the incident.

<P>After 30 years of international terrorist activity, it is quite clear
that only concerted international effort against terrorists--and particularly
against their sponsoring states--can bring about a significant decline
of international terrorism. It is necessary to arrest the contemporary
terrorist leaders, such as Osama bin Laden and Imad Moughania, now, while
they are in their prime, and not wait until they have become “fossils.”
If this is not done many lives will be lost over the next decade or two
before these men are finally tracked down and brought to trial.
