<p><center><h2>Olympic Bomb Plot to Blow up Sydney Nuclear Reactor Foiled:
<br><i>How Serious the Threat?</i></h2></center>
<P><b>Ely Karmon</b>
<BR><b>ICT</b>
<P><font size="-1">An abbreviated version of this article was published in Haaretz on 3 September 2000</font>

<p><p><b>Background</b>
<p>In March of this year police in New Zealand uncovered a possible plot
to blow up a nuclear reactor in Sydney during the upcoming Olympic Games.
In the course of an investigation into people-smuggling by organized crime
syndicates the Auckland police conducted a series of house raids in the
capital city of New Zealand and found evidence suggesting a plan to attack
the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor near Sydney, Australia.
<p>According to a senior Auckland detective, one of the apartments in a
Mt. Albert home was converted into a virtual command center, complete with
conference table and maps. A Sydney street map was found with the site
of the reactor and access routes to it highlighted. Moreover, entries in
a notebook outlined police security tactics, standards and chains of command
for the Auckland Commonwealth Games in 1990.
<p>There were signs that a clandestine cell of refugees was granted New
Zealand residency. The cell consisted of about 20 mainly Afghani, refugees
in Auckland, who it is believed have been familiarizing themselves with
the Western way of doing things, possibly as a forerunner to a foreign
attack. They were using the relative anonymity and remoteness of New Zealand
as a launching pad for more serious activity. New Zealand residency seemed
attractive because the use of New Zealand passports is likely to avoid
suspicion when entering target countries.
<p>There were strong indications that at least some members of the cell
have had previous military training and have fought in Afghanistan, Iraq,
Iran, Bosnia, Chechnya, Somalia and Sri Lanka. Some were photographed brandishing
AK-47s during their earlier lifestyles. Some of these supposedly near-penniless
refugees have made frequent trips to Southeast Asian countries such as
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The marked street map and the notes on
police tactics were found in the possession of an Iranian refugee, who
claimed he found it inside a National Geographic magazine he bought at
a garage sale.
<p>The New Zealand Herald and other sources speculated that people connected
to Osama bin Laden might have devised the plot. New Zealand Police Minister
George Hawkins said arrests were made during the raids but the people involved
were charged with only minor offences like passport and immigration offences.
The New South Wales police in Australia had been briefed by New Zealand
on the potential threat to the Lucas Heights nuclear research reactor and
the two forces are working together on the case.
<p>Australian and New Zealand officials played down the seriousness of
the threat to the research reactor, some 25 km (15 miles) from the main
Olympic stadium on the outskirts of Sydney and said the risk of an attack
was low.
<p>New South Wales<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </font>Police
Commissioner Peter Ryan, who serves as head of security for the Sydney
Olympics stated in an interview with NBC on August 28 that the reported
plot to blow up the reactor during the games had been exaggerated and he
did not think there was any threat. He described the Afghan refugee group
as an Islamic group allegedly involved so far only in the illegal immigration
of people, money laundering and other activities, but “certainly not terrorism.”
<p>However, Greenpeace activists, conservation groups and nearby residents
were not convinced and converged on the site of Australia’s only nuclear
reactor to protest that the plant was old, leaky and long a security threat.
The <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> reported calls in April last year for
the Lucas Heights reactor to be shut down for the Sydney Olympics, as Atlanta
authorities did with a smaller research facility there before the 1996
games in the United States. The <i>Herald</i> quoted a leading anti-reactor
campaigner as saying nuclear authorities in Australia acknowledged a potential
terrorism threat when they increased security at the Lucas Heights reactor
during the 1991 Gulf War.
<p>The plant, used for scientific and medical research, is much smaller
than an electricity-generating nuclear reactor, producing only about 10
megawatts of thermal energy compared with 3,000 megawatts for an electricity-generating
reactor. According to an Australian anti-nuclear campaigner a meltdown
at the Lucas Heights, a highly enriched uranium reactor, would take just
eight minutes, leaving no time to evacuate suburbs, while normal reactors
took 40 minutes to melt down, as happened at Chernobyl.
<p>Melbourne’s <i>Herald Sun</i> newspaper reported in April 1999 that
the Australian Security and Intelligence Organization (ASIO) was investigating
claims that bin Laden was trying to recruit members in the city. Police
were on alert following allegations, which emerged in a court case in which
an Iraqi national was accused of attacking a family for refusing to join
bin Laden’s extremist Muslim group.
<p>Security agencies in the United States, Canada and Britain were also
looking into the possible plot, according to local newspapers.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Past Terrorist Incidents against Nuclear Facilities</b>
<p>An attack against a nuclear facility has always been considered by specialists
to be one of the main potential threats of nuclear terrorism. However,
the historical record to date has been benign. Terrorists have rarely attacked
nuclear facilities, stolen nuclear weapons or weapon-grade nuclear materials.
<p>To date, there have occurred perhaps six attacks on nuclear power plants
in France, South Africa, Argentina, the Philippines, and Spain. Fortunately,
all of the reactors were in the early stages of construction and were not
operational.
<p>Between 1966 and 1977 there were 10 terrorist incidents against European
nuclear installations. In 1979 environmental terrorists succeeded in inflicting
20 million dollars worth of damage to a French nuclear plant. In 1982 five
rockets were fired into the French Creys-Malville nuclear facility, but
the damage was minor. Between 1969 and 1975, in addition to 240 bombing
threats against US nuclear facilities, there were 14 actual and attempted
bombings.
<p>According to a Russian intelligence official, during the years 1995-1997
there were 50 instances of nuclear blackmail in Russia. Most of them were
hoaxes. The most dangerous trend in these years, according to this source,
is the so-called motiveless acts of terror, in which the criminals put
forward no political or financial demands. In such cases there is nothing
to negotiate.
<p>A research database maintained at the International Policy Institute
for Counter-terrorism (ICT) includes some 300 incidents of chemical, biological
and nuclear terrorism. From the statistical analysis of this database it
appears clearly that most of the terrorism involving nuclear targets (167
incidents for the period 1970 - 1999) happened mostly in the 1970-1979
period (120) and diminished dramatically in the next two decades. Even
so, the great majority of the incidents involve threats (98) or involved
mainly actions against facilities (43). These actions were due mainly to
the activity of extremist left-wing organizations which opposed the American
and Western nuclear armament and deployment of nuclear missiles, especially
in Europe.
<p>The ecological movement that emerged in the advanced industrial West
in the early 1970s, like the youth movements of the 1960s from which it
emanated, has been issue-oriented. A multitude of issues, revolving around
the protection of the environment and the enhancement of the quality of
life originally concerned the ecological activists. However, the nuclear
issue, which is socially, politically, and economically potent, gradually
eclipsed these other issues. By the mid-1970s, the ecological movement
had been essentially transformed into an antinuclear movement.
<p>Though the antinuclear cause is extremely complex, its advocates have
usually directed their activity against the visible edifice of the nuclear
industry and have demanded the termination of nuclear development in a
certain region or country, or over the globe.
<p>This is the reason why most of the terrorist activity was carried out
against facilities, usually the period before the completion of the nuclear
projects. In the countries were there was an active national-separatist
movement, like the ETA in Spain and the Breton Liberation Front in France,
the separatists used the issue to gain the support of large fractions of
the population, which were contrary to the building of nuclear plants in
the region.
<p>With the disintegration of the anti-nuclear movement in the middle of
the 1980s and parallel with the elimination of the violent extremist leftist
groups in Europe and the USA and the fall of the Soviet Union, which had
the strategic interest in supporting the anti-nuclear movement, the anti-nuclear
violent activity almost disappeared.
<p><b>Osama Bin Laden’s Efforts in the Field of Non-Conventional Weapons</b>
<p>According to various reports, Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire
responsible for the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, and his organization Al-Qaida are involved in an effort to
acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with the capabilities to develop
such weapons themselves.
<p>The Italian newspaper <i>Corriere della Sera</i> reported in May 1998
that Osama’s representatives bought three chemical and biological agent
production laboratories in the former Yugoslavia. In addition, the organization
received radioactive material and pesticides from Ukraine, and hired a
number of Ukrainian experts (chemists and biologists) whose job will be
to optimize the poisons and train the activists.
<p>According to this information, the first factory has already been set
up in a well-equipped camp near Kandahar in Afghanistan, and the second
is nearing completion at Zenica, the Bosnian village that the Muslims made
their base during the war.
<p>Another report by the Arab magazine <i>Al Watan El Arabi</i>, claimed
that Bin Laden had acquired from Kazakhstan 20 nuclear warheads, originally
from the former Soviet nuclear arsenal. In return Bin Laden paid 30 million
dollars in cash along with two tons of heroin, which was given to him by
his allies in the Taliban militia. According to the report, this deal was
mediated by the Chechen Mafia.
<p>Bin Laden’s intentions of acquiring nuclear weapons are known to Western
intelligence agencies for five years now. According to different sources,
he expressed his intention to “spare no expense” in order to be ready to
use nuclear warheads and acquire experts to operate them.
<p>Bin Laden was also believed to be one of the principal investors of
the “al Shifa” pharmaceuticals factory, the Sudan target of the American
strikes in August 1998, which Western intelligence agencies claimed was
a front for chemical weapons facility. The plant was said to have been
built with the assistance of Iraqi technicians and its main product was
a key component VX nerve gas. Lately the American administration has been
much more cautious about the information it claimed concerning the factory’s
involvement with chemical weapons.
<p><i>Al Watan El Arabi</i> claimed in January 1999 that bin Laden and
the Iraqi regime have arrived at an agreement to fight together against
the U.S., including cooperation in the production of biological and chemical
weapons in bin Laden’s laboratories with the assistance of Iraqi specialists.
<p>The London-based <i>Al-Hayat</i> claimed in April 1999 that one of the
important militants of the Egyptian Jihad organization, on trial in Egypt
declared that bin Laden has biological and chemical weapons and that he
intended to use them against 100 American and Israeli targets.
<p>All this detailed information has not been confirmed by reliable sources.
Bin Laden himself for the first time alluded personally to the subject
in an interview to <i>Time Magazine</i> in January 1999:
<blockquote><font size=+0>Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims
is a religious duty. If I have indeed acquired these weapons, then I thank
God for enabling me to do so. And if I seek to acquire these weapons, I
am carrying out a duty. It would be a sin for Muslims not to try to possess
the weapons that would prevent the infidels from inflicting harm on Muslims.</font></blockquote>
The U.S. indictment of November 1998 against Osama bin Laden states that
from 1993 onwards bin Laden and other members of his Al-Qaida organization
made efforts to obtain components of nuclear weapons and to produce chemical
weapons. There are no details concerning these efforts and what they obtained.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Significance of the Auckland Incident</b>
<p>If the information provided by the New Zealand authorities about the
Islamist Afghani (?) cell uncovered in Auckland in March 2000 is indeed
accurate—albeit belated and sketchy—it points very clearly to an operational
plan to attack the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor near Sydney, Australia.
<p>There are many significant clues here: the terrain information on the
maps; the security arrangements for a previous popular sports event,<i>
</i>the Auckland Commonwealth Games in 1990; the various trips by members
of the cell to countries in the region with large Islamic populations,
as well as the militant past of the Afghanis involved. All this suggests
that behind all this activity there was a plan to prepare at least an option
for an attack on the nuclear reactor, if not a substantial threat to attack
it.
<p>It is interesting that although the members of the group seem to have
traveled a lot in the region, no information was provided on whether they
ever visited Australia or had contacts with other people or supporters
in Sydney or elsewhere in Australia.
<p>The approach of the Australian and New Zealand authorities to this incident
is in line with the handling of such occurrences by other countries in
the past: the neutralization of the cell, the low profile in the publicity
given to it, the prevention of a <i>casus-belli </i>with the group/organization
behind the event by liberating those whose arrest could have provoked a
direct retaliation during the Olympic Games.
<p>However, this incident is notably different from other incidents and
attacks in the past. It is probably the first serious deliberate attempt
by a terrorist organization or group to plan an attack on a <i>live</i>
reactor, even if small in size—perhaps even because of its small size.
<p>The details revealed—even without the missing Australian fragment—the
timetable of the preparations (several months and more from the beginning
of the Games) and the number of people involved show a high degree of operational
planning.
<p>Most of the people involved in the cell are of Afghani origin, but to
the best of our knowledge there is no known Afghan terrorist organization
operating abroad. The Afghani Taliban regime is indeed giving shelter to
and training Islamist terrorist groups on its territory, most of all to
Osama bin Laden and his followers, and as a result it is suffering from
sanctions decided by the United Nations.
<p>The Taliban government is also angry about the attitude of the Olympic
authorities vis-&agrave;-vis their regime. The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) suspended Afghanistan’s national committee last October, because
it no longer could function under the Taliban<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</font>regime in Kabul. The IOC cannot deal with the national Olympic committee
of a country whose government is not recognized<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</font>by the United Nations, and therefore the IOC was not able to issue
invitations for Afghan athletes to the Sydney games.
<p>However, it is highly improbable that the Taliban are involved in such
a sensitive and dangerous operation, as they are trying hard to arrive
at an agreement with the United Nations, the United States and the European
Union to put an end to the sanctions and be recognized as the legitimate
government of Afghanistan.
<p>Therefore, it is possible that the Afghanis involved in the plot are
members of an Islamist organization with strong ties to Afghanistan, and
bin Laden’s al-Qaida group is the first suspect. Bin Laden was behind the
bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salam,
Tanzania, in August 1998 and these attacks were prepared carefully long
in advance. The exposure of the Sydney operation, if bin Laden is indeed
responsible for it, is a new failure<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">
</font>in the chain<font face="Times New Roman (Hebrew)"> </font>of his
attempts to strike at American and Western targets since the successful
ain Africa in 1998.
<p>If, again, the information provided by the New Zealand authorities is
correct, the plan to attack the live Sydney nuclear reactor could signify
a second breaking of the taboo in the use of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD), after the sarin attack by the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo extremist cult
in March 1995. This time the threat is from an extremist Islamist organization,
a scenario long feared by both intelligence agencies and researchers.

<li>
<font size=-1>The exact meaning of nuclear terrorism is not always clear.
Nuclear terrorism can range from the actual detonation of nuclear weapons
or acts of nuclear violence, for example, in the form of the release of
radioactive substances or the radioactive contamination of drinking water,
to acts of sabotage in and against nuclear power plants. The “nuclear”
aspect can either relate to the means employed by the terrorists (nuclear
weapons) or to their target (reactors). See also Frank Forest, in R.A.
