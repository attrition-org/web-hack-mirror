<p>The much-anticipated trial of two Libyans accused of downing Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, has now been in session for two weeks.
In this brief period, important developments have already taken place both
inside and outside the courtroom. Although prior to the trial, there was
much speculation on the deficiency of the prosecution's evidence, the first
two weeks of the trial should cast doubt on the reliability of the defense
team's rational. In the meantime, Tripoli has launched a well-concerted
public relations campaign distancing itself from the proceedings and the
defendants.
<p><b>Prosecution's Opening Moves</b>
<br>In a well-calculated move, the prosecution began its case by graphically
depicting the scene of the crime. In this sense, the prosecution focused
attention on the fact that this was a horrible act of terror that extinguished
many promising lives. In riveting testimony, air-traffic controllers and
local residents recaptured the moment when Pan Am Flight 103 disappeared
from the radar screen and began its descent toward its demise. "There was
fire raining down right beside me. I was dodging as it landed," recalled
Lockerbie resident Jasmine Bell. Another resident testified that the exploding
firebomb was "like an atomic bomb . . . like mushrooms flaring up, you
could feel the heat." The Lockerbie case is often portrayed in antiseptic
terms with discussion of high politics and diplomacy. The prosecution's
preliminary moves compelled all the observers to return to the human tragedy,
which is the real Lockerbie case.
<p><b>Defense's Case</b>
<br>The defense team's opening statement ended all the speculation about
its strategy. It appears that the defense rebuttal will be based on two
mutually reinforcing propositions: The responsibility for the bombing lies
with various militant Palestinian groups and the forensic evidence was
either mishandled or deliberately planted. The strategy of the defense
lawyers is to create sufficient doubt in the minds of the judges to secure
a "not proven" verdict. The advantage the defense possesses is the high
threshold for conviction required under Scottish law. In a "not proven"
verdict, the three-panel judge could ostensibly declare that the evidence
presented could not legally affirm the guilt of the suspects. As such,
the burden of proof that the prosecution has to meet is considerably higher
than required by the American legal system.
<p>The defense team set the tone early when, in its opening statement,
it alleged that two Syrian-based groups, the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command and the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front,
were behind the Lockerbie bombing. The defense lawyers implicated Mohammad
Abu Talb, a Palestinian serving a life sentence in Sweden for previous
bombings in Denmark and Netherlands, as one of the leading conspirators.
The defense case was apparently bolstered when, under cross-examination,
Gordon Ferrie, the lead detective, acknowledged that initial suspicion
fell on the Palestinian groups as the explosion resembled the 1972 bombing
of an El Al passenger plane that was attributed to Palestinian terrorist
organizations.
<p>The crucial question remains, on whose behalf did the Palestinians undertake
such an action? Both Libyan Col. Mu'ammar Qadhafi and the defense lawyers
are suggesting that the Lockerbie bombing was retribution by Iran for the
U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner in 1988. Yet, this rational leads Tripoli
into a sensitive area, as it enjoys cordial economic and political relations
with Tehran. As such, Qadhafi has stressed that "this does not mean that
Iran as a state or the Iranian government is convicted or condemned. The
Lockerbie issue is an individual one." In remarkably tortuous logic, Qadhafi
insists that either rogue Libyan agents unrelated to Tripoli or unruly
Iranian intelligence officials similarly unconnected with Tehran contracted
a Palestinian group ordinarily under Syrian command to destroy an American
airliner.
<p>Along similar lines, defense lawyers are also challenging the reliability
of evidence and the possibility of manipulation of data. In an investigation
that surveyed 800 square miles and catalogued 40,000 pieces of evidence,
there is bound to be a degree of misplacement. The defense is exploiting
the possibility of human error to suggest a deeper conspiracy. Under intensive
cross-examination, defense counsels compelled Scottish police officer Duncan
McInnes to acknowledge that the sheer volume of wreckage led to certain
pieces of evidence being labeled retroactively. Given the presence of CIA
and FBI officials on the scene, the defense seems to be implying that American
functionaries with animus toward Libya may have readjusted the position
and nature of evidence. In the coming weeks this line of reasoning is likely
to be further elaborated by a defense team determined to provoke uncertainty
in the minds of the three-panel judge.
<p><b>Qadhafi's Retort.</b>
<br>As the trial of the two suspects began in Netherlands, Tripoli quickly
launched a well-coordinated public relations campaign designed to negate
the lingering allegations implicating his regime. In a series of interviews,
Qadhafi emphasized that "the court is sitting to judge them [the individual
defendants], not whether they are Libyan agents. The court is sitting to
decide if they are guilty or not." The colonel foreclosed the possibility
of further expansion of the trial by saying the trial "is concerned about
these two suspects only. Because if you go further than it becomes an endless
chain."
<p>In the meantime, Tripoli greeted the opening of the trial by expediting
various commercial agreements. Libya's National Oil Company quickly announced
a framework for gas exploration terms that had been stalemated in bureaucratic
channels for months, which would allow nearly fifty international oil companies--including
Royal Dutch/Shell, Japan's National Oil Company, Malaysia's Petronas, and
Russia's Yukos--the opportunity to license up to eighty new off-shore and
on-shore oil and gas fields. The Libyan officials similarly informed industry
sources that not only more gas fields would be opened for exploitation
but that they would be available to as many nations as possible. As the
media focused on the developments in Netherlands, Tripoli effectively denoted
to the international community the increasing importance of its market
in the post-sanctions period. Libya's strategy seems to be to marginalize
the trial through the lure of its subterranean wealth and persistent denials.
<p><b>What Next?</b>
<br>The coming month is likely to see some of the most explosive developments
in the trial. Among the evidence and witnesses slated for examination are
the remnants of the radio-cassette player allegedly detonating the bomb
and clothing found in the debris that is attributed to one of the suspects.
The crucial witness who will take the stand shortly will be the proprietor
of the Swiss firm, MEBO, that sold twenty bomb timers to the Libyan regime.
The Lockerbie trial is about to enter some of its most vexing stages as
all the contenders are finally going to move beyond setting the stage,
turning to address the actual evidence.
