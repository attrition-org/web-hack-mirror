        SAA:28 29 Iyar 5752 1 June 1992

        <p>Over the past twenty years, Libya has been foremost on

        the list of countries supporting terrorism. Upon seizing

        power in 1969, Muammar Qaddafi put the dissemination of

        his revolutionary ideology throughout the world at the

        top of Libya&#146;s national agenda. The Libyan

        authorities earmarked vast economic and military

        resources for the realization of their

        &quot;revolutionary goal: Libya established extensive

        ties with dozens of terrorist organizations around the

        world, providing these groups with varied assistance.

        Numerous terrorist attacks have been carried out on

        Libya&#146;s behalf or with its help in Europe, Asia,

        South Africa and South America. Qaddafi has declared that

        the day his men would carry out attacks in North America

        as well, was not far off. </p>

        <p>Addressing the Organization of Non-Aligned States in

        September 1986, Qaddafi declared: &quot;I will do

        everything in my power to divide the world into

        imperialists and freedom-fighters.&quot; Any violent

        action against one of the &quot;imperialist&quot; states

        is just and welcome. Those perpetrating these attacks are

        not &quot;terrorists&quot; in Qaddafi&#146;s parlance,

        but rather &quot;freedom fighters,&quot; because

        &quot;national liberation can only be achieved through

        armed struggle.&quot; Any attempt at bargaining,

        negotiating or reaching a compromise with the

        &quot;imperialist bloc&quot; is doomed to failure and

        will harm the Arab cause. </p>

        <p>In accordance with the ideology adopted by Libya

        following Qaddafi&#146;s rise to power, the country

        vigorously applied itself to aiding terrorist

        &quot;freedom organizations&quot; and dictatorships

        threatened by the democratic &quot;imperialist

        enemy.&quot; </p>

        <p><font size="4">Aiding International Terror </font></p>

        <p>Beginning in the early 1970s, Qaddafi energetically

        spread his revolutionary network to include terrorist

        organizations worldwide. To this end, Libya granted its

        sponsorship to many revolutionary groups fighting any of

        the Western countries. </p>

        <p>During this period, Qaddafi established the first

        terrorist training camps on Libyan soil, began the flow

        of arms to the various terrorist organizations, and

        granted asylum to &quot;wanted&quot; terrorists. </p>

        <p>In November 1976, Libyan and Algerian representatives

        concluded a secret agreement to arm, finance and train

        the Basques in Spain, as well as the Britons and

        Corsicans in France. In December 1977, Libya convened a

        conference in Tripoli of Arab nations opposed to the

        Sadat initiative, including Algeria, Syria, Iraq, South

        Yemen and the PLO, as well as host Libya. </p>

        <p>Qaddafi transferred considerable sums of money to the

        Sandinistas in Nicaragua and groups in El Salvador. In

        April 1983, a Libyan plane landed in Brazil purportedly

        carrying medical supplies destined for Nicaragua. Large

        quantities of arms were discovered in the plane&#146;s

        hold, for delivery to the Colombian group M19. </p>

        <p>The groups aided by Libya also include the IRA in the

        U.K. the Red Brigades in Italy; and others in Japan,

        Turkey, Thailand and elsewhere, as well as the various

        Palestinian terrorist groups. </p>

        <p>Qaddafi even went so far as to send Libyan troops to

        areas of international conflict or to the aid of the

        organizations he sponsored in the form of military

        instructors, specialized units, or combat regulars. Libya

        sent troops to aid the PLO in Lebanon in Mid-1981 (just

        before Operation Peace for Galilee began) along with SA-9

        surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and ZSU anti-tank weapons.

        </p>

        <p>Many terrorist organizations around the world succeed

        in carrying out attacks only because they enjoy lavish

        Libyan support. Libya provides monthly or annual payments

        to various organizations worldwide. It also collects a 6

        percent tax on the income of Palestinians working in

        Libya, and transfers the money to the PLO-controlled

        Palestine National Fund. Libya has also made special

        grants to those responsible for a particular attack, or

        to a specific organization, in recognition of their

        actions. In their early 1970s, Qaddafi awarded Arafat $5

        million in recognition of the massacre of Israel athletes

        carried out by Arafat&#146;s men at the Munich Olympics. </p>

        <p>Numerous terrorist organizations around the world

        employ Soviet-made arms, supplied by Libya. These arms

        include BM-21 grenade-launchers with a range of 40

        kilometers, 122 mm Katyusha rocket launchers, 130, 122

        and 57mm field guns (such as supplied to the PLO in

        Lebanon immediately prior to Operation Peace for

        Galilee), as well as sub-machine guns, grenades and

        explosives used in terrorist attacks. </p>

        <p>In March 1990, the President of Czechoslovakia

        revealed that the communist regime in his country had

        provided the Libyan authorities with 1,000 tons of Semtex

        plastic explosives. According to the Czechoslovak

        President, &quot;this quantity is sufficient to support

        terrorism throughout the world for 150 years.&quot;

        Worldwide attention has also been focused at Libya&#146;s

        capacity for the production and storage of large

        quantities of nerve gas. </p>

        <p>Libya&#146;s embassies throughout the world serve the

        terrorist groups as arms supply centers with weapons

        transported to the embassies from Libya by diplomatic

        pouch. Libyan diplomats also supply terrorists with

        intelligence regarding possible targets, forged

        documents, and assistance in arranging safe-houses in the

        target countries. </p>

        <p>Many terrorists around the world receive training in

        Libya. Libya opened its military bases to the terrorist

        organizations and accepted numerous terrorists to various

        training courses in all fields of military expertise.

        PFLP leader, Ahmed Jibril, has declared: &quot;Libya

        trains my men in hijacking and carrying out suicide

        attacks against Israel. The PFLP&#146;s pilots train on

        Mig-23s.&quot; Libya has also established special

        training camps on Libyan soil to serve hundreds of

        terrorists from various groups. At these bases -

        centering around the towns of Sinawin, Zuwarah and Tubruq

        - the terrorists train under Libyan, Cuban and other

        instructors. In addition, the Libyans help the terrorist

        organizations to recruit operatives, Palestinians in

        particular, from among their brethren residing in Libya. </p>

        <p>The Libyans have offered on many occasions to serve as

        a haven for terrorists wanted by various countries for

        the perpetration of attacks. Such was the case with the

        three murderers of the Israeli athletes in Munich in

        1972, those responsible for the massacre at Athens

        airport in 1973, the hijackers of the Jewish immigrants

        train in Vienna in 1973, as well as others. </p>

        <p><font size="4">Direct Libyan Involvement</font> </p>

        <p>Libyan involvement in terrorism includes attacks

        carried out by soldiers, security operatives or Libyan

        diplomats, usually against Libyan dissidents abroad. The

        killing of a British policewoman by shots fired from the

        Libyan Embassy in London at anti-Libyan demonstrators is

        one such example. </p>

        <p>Further terrorist attacks initiated by Libya include

        those commissioned by key members of the Libyan political

        hierarchy or their surrogates in the security forces.

        They are carried out by various terrorist organizations

        in return for generous financial payment. </p>

        <p>In 1989, a French airliner exploded over the Saharan

        Desert, killing 170 passengers and crew. A French judge

        appointed to investigate the tragedy issued an

        international warrant for the arrest of a number of

        Libyan nationals suspected of having caused the

        explosion, included: Abdallah Sanoussi (Qaddafi&#146;s

        nephew, considered number two in his intelligence

        services), Mussa Kussa (deputy foreign minister in charge

        of terrorist activities outside Libya), and Abdallah

        Salem Zadma (number three in the Libyan Intelligence

        services). </p>

        <p>Following the attempted attack at the Nitzanim and

        Ga&#146;ash beaches in Israel in May 1990, Amnon Shahak,

        head of the IDF Intelligence Branch, stated that the

        mother ship had transported the terrorists&#146; boats

        from the Libyan port of Benghazi to the Israeli coast.

        The Libyans had assisted in preparations for the attack

        at all stages. According to Shahak, &quot;The mother ship

        was Libyan, its crew was Libyan, a Libyan military

        officer was on board, and the Libyans also helped

        transport the terrorists from their base to the

        ship.&quot; </p>

        <p><font size="4">U.S. Reaction to Libyan Terrorism </font></p>

        <p>Following Libyan involvement in the murderous attacks

        at the El Al counters at the Vienna and Rome airports in

        1985, and after a considerable portion of Libya&#146;s

        involvement in international terrorism had become public

        knowledge, U.S. President Reagan, in January 1986,

        ordered all economic ties with Libya severed and Libyan

        assets in the U.S. frozen. Reagan also called upon other

        countries to join the economic boycott against Libya. </p>

        <p>The economic sanctions led to fears that Qaddafi would

        attempt to take revenge against the U.S. and Libya indeed

        embarked upon a campaign of terrorism against the U.S.

        and Western targets in Europe. In March 1986, American

        targets were struck in Lebanon, Italy and Germany. The

        most severe was the bombing of a Berlin discotheque,

        killing two U.S. servicemen and injuring dozens. </p>

        <p>In order to put a stop to the wave of terrorism

        sweeping over Europe, the U.S. concentrated troops from

        the Sixth Fleet in the Gulf of Sidra opposite Libya. A

        continuation of the terrorist attacks led the U.S. to

        take retaliatory military action and in April 1986,

        American planes attacked government and military

        installations in Benghazi and Tripoli, killing thirty

        Libyans. </p>

        <p>According to the U.S. State Department annual report

        on international terrorism published in May 1990, Qaddafi

        continues to support some thirty terrorist groups,

        including that of Abu Nidal, with funds, training and

        other assistance. </p>

        <p>In January 1991, President Bush informed the U.S.

        Congress that he was continuing U.S. sanctions against

        Libya, since the &quot;Libyan government continues to

        employ international terrorism and to support it, in

        violation of international law and international rules of

        conduct.&quot; </p>

        <p><font size="4">Pan Am Flight 103 (Lockerbie)</font> </p>

        <p>In December 1988, a Pan American airliner blew up over

        the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Two hundred and eighty

        people were killed in the explosion, most of them

        passengers aboard the plane, some residents of Lockerbie,

        whose homes were struck by falling debris. In November

        1991, the Americans and the British announced officially

        that their investigation indicated the following suspects

        in the bombing: Abel Basset Ail Al-Maghrahi (former

        director of security at the Libyan airline and later head

        of the Center of Strategic Studies in Tripoli) and Laman

        Khalifa Fhimah (director of the Libyan airline office in

        Malta). According to the U.S. spokesman, the two trained

        for the attack at a military installation in Libya over a

        period of three years: &quot;They planted the bomb in a

        Toshiba brand radio-cassette recorder and exploited their

        aviation connections to ensure that their bag would be on

        board Pan Am Flight 103, leaving from Frankfurt. When the

        passengers changed flights in London, the bag

        followed.&quot; The two were indicted and the U.S.

        demanded their extradition in order to stand trial in the

        United States, and threatened to impose international

        sanctions upon Libya. Under U.S. and British pressure,

        the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 731 calling

        upon Libya to extradite the two suspects. At this stage

        it is unclear how the affair will end. It must be taken

        into account, however, that in order to prevent the

        incrimination of senior officials in the Libyan

        administration, traces of the two suspects in the bombing

        may disappear. </p>

        <p>Senior Libyan officials, both within the political

        establishment and the upper echelons of the military

        hierarchy, are engaged in developing and maintaining

        Libya&#146;s ties with terrorist organizations around the

        world. The scope of the vast aid granted by Libya, both

        in the past and at present to international terrorism,

        varies according to Libya&#146;s international standing

        and its critical interests at any given time. Thus, when

        the West increases its pressure upon Libya (whether

        economic, diplomatic or military), it curbs some of its

        contacts with the various terrorist organizations.

        However, when Qaddafi feels the economic or military

        noose loosening, he immediately renews ties with the

        terrorist organizations, even publicly flaunting those

        ties. </p>
