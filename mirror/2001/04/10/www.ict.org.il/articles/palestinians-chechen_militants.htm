<p><b>Reuven Paz</b>
<br><b>ICT Academic Director</b>
<p>The hijacking of a Daghestani plane to Israel on November 12<sup>th</sup>
evoked in many Israelis fears of a Chechen Islamist terrorist operation
against Israel. These fears were allayed after several hours when it turned
out that the hijacker was a mentally unstable individual, totally unconnected
to the Chechen militants. However, at the time the worry was real; preliminary
information suggested that the hijacking was a kind of “Operation Al-Aqsa”
by Chechen Islamist rebels against an Israeli target. This line of thought
was based on developments over the past year among the Chechen Islamist
groups. Since last October, these groups have been expressing public support
for the Palestinians in general and the Islamic groups in particular, and
have issued numerous public threats against Israel.
<p>Until recently, the interest of Islamist groups in Central Asia and
South Caucasus in Israel and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was very
marginal. In the last years we could trace only a few contacts between
Palestinian Islamist groups and their Asian counterparts. Traditional ties
were forged primarily by the non-violent Palestinian Islamic Movement,
<i>Da`wah
wa-Tabligh</i> with its mother movement in Pakistan and India. Palestinian
Muslims would journey to India from time to time, there to visit shrines
and centers of the movement as part of a religious pilgrimage.
<p>First contacts with Indian Islamic movements by Hamas and the Islamic
Movement in Israel were made in 1998 through their participation in conferences
of the Indo-Pakistani Jamaati-i-Islam, the counterpart of the Muslim Brotherhood
in the Arab world. This resulted in some verbal support of Indian and Pakistani
Islamic groups for the Palestinian Islamic struggle.
<p><b>Palestinian participation in Osama bin Laden's Front</b>
<br>The first real threat by Asian Islamists to launch attacks on Israeli
targets appeared in the declarations and Islamic religious rulings of Osama
Bin Laden, in the framework of his “Front for Jihad against the Jews and
the Crusaders.” Between December 1999 and September 2000, a group of Islamists
connected to this Front was arrested and tried in Jordan. The detainees,
most of them Jordanians of Palestinian origin, had planned to attack American
and Israeli targets in Jordan. A Palestinian with an American passport
was extradited to Jordan by Pakistan in relation to this group.
<p>The Jordanian group was evidence of an older phenomenon, the extensive
Palestinian participation in Islamist terrorist networks during the 1990s
in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sudan, Lebanon, and Jordan (see: <a href="palestinian_islamism.htm">Palestinian
Participation in Islamist Global Network</a>, April 2000, ICT). Behind
the scenes lies a significant fact: the ideology of the Afghan Mujahidin
and Bin Laden’s <i>Al-Qa`idah </i>was first developed by the Palestinian
Dr. Abdallah `Azzam during the 1980s.
<p>The struggle of the Chechen rebels was, until the 1990s, more nationalist
than Islamist in nature. Following the withdrawal of the Soviets from Afghanistan
in 1989, a multinational Islamist battalion under the command of the Jordanian
Khattab became increasingly active and dominant in the Islamist struggle
in Chechnya. The influence of this battalion has now spread to other Muslim
republics and Muslim populations in the region.
<p><b>Gaining world recognition</b>
<br>One of the problems faced by the Chechen Islamists is the relative
indifference to their struggle in the Western world in general and the
United States in particular. Unlike previous Balkan conflicts, where the
Americans and the European commonwealth initiated international involvement
against Serbia in defense of Muslim population in Bosnia and Kossovo, there
is almost no international interest in the fight in Chechnya, nor any attempt
to block or limit the Russian activities. Unlike the case of the Balkans,
where the Serbs were perceived as the “bad guys” in the case of the Caucasus,
it is the Islamist rebels in Chechnya and Daghestan, who are viewed as
the “bad guys.” This is at least partially due to their being seen as part
of the Islamist phenomenon of Afghanistan and Bin Laden.
<p>The Chechen support for the violent events of the Palestinian <i>Intifadah</i>
could thus serve three main goals:
<ol>
<li>
In attempting to presents the Chechen struggle as part of the Islamist
global struggle against the conspiracy of the US and Israel or “the Jews
and Western culture,” the militants seek the support of Muslim countries,
which have hitherto shown indifference to the Chechen struggle.</li>

<li>
Such linkage gives the Chechen struggle an air of internationalism, thus
generating more interest.</li>

<li>
The connection with the issue of Palestine could aid the Chechen efforts
to raise funds among Muslim communities, through their support for Al-Aqsa
and the Palestinians.</li>
</ol>
Since October 7<sup>th</sup>, the military command of the Chechen Mujahidin
has begun issuing statements about the Palestinian uprising, written in
very severe Anti-Jewish language and attempting to link the their struggle
to the Palestinian cause. Among such statements, by the Chechen Islamists
is one that stated:
<blockquote>We continue to grieve because our beloved Aqsa is in the hands
of lawless occupiers, the Jews. Without doubt, they are the worst of all
nations Allah has created. Throughout history they have rebelled against
Allah and have slain their Prophets. We cannot mention Al-Aqsa - may Allah
liberate it - without feeling the pain in our hearts because of what happened
and continues to happen. With every passing day, this wound is gouged deeper
and deeper. The latest arrow to pierce this wound was when Ariel Sharon
defiled the sanctity of Al-Aqsa, a few days ago…
<p>The Jews continue to bitterly complain of the atrocities they suffered
over 50 years ago. Yet they mercilessly shed Muslim blood on the land of
Palestine. They weep in memory of the prison camps, yet now it is the Muslims
that look back at their captors through barbed wire. They pounce on their
critics as 'anti-Semitic', yet their hatred for the Muslim people is undisguised
and confirmed by the worst atrocities.</blockquote>
The statement ended with “A Promise from Chechnya”:
<blockquote>Finally, we promise you that soon <i>insha-Allah</i>, you will
hear of what we do with the brothers of the Jews, the Russians, in retaliation
for Al-Aqsa and for you. Wait for a forth-coming operation that we have
named 'Operation Al-Aqsa'. That is all that we can do to comfort you and
heal your wounds. Indeed, Allah is the source of support and reliance should
be on nothing but him.
<p>We ask Allah with every Glorious Name He gave Himself and every Honorable
Description to bestow victory on all of our struggling Mujahidin brothers
everywhere and in particular those in Palestine. We ask Him to make it
easy on them and to crush their enemies, turning them back defeated and
broken. Indeed He is capable of everything.</blockquote>
On October 11<sup>th</sup>, a member of the Chechen Military Command Council
announced that one hundred and fifty Mujahidin from Chechnya were “readily
available to perform Jihad in Palestine,” adding
<blockquote>… the only thing they are missing is the coordination for their
entrance to Palestine through neighboring Islamic countries, if that is
possible! Although the number of volunteers is more than the mentioned
number, however, these Mujahidin are prepared to leave at any time. Even
with the current situation that the Republic of Chechnya lives in, the
hearts are still thirsty for Jihad in Palestine. Although this feeling
might be in the heart of every Muslim, it has a greater effect in the hearts
of the Mujahidin in Chechnya considering the situation they are in.
<p>We ask Allah to destroy the heartless Jews and their allies. Ameen.</blockquote>
The Chechen statements have not had much affect on the Palestinians, or
on the Islamic groups. On November 5<sup>th</sup>, Hamas leader Sheikh
Ahmad Yasin publicly called upon the Chechen Islamists “to stay in their
land and continue their sacred fight against the Russians,” rather than
coming to the aid of the Palestinians. It seems reasonable to assume that
the Hamas leader would not be overjoyed to see the involvement of Islamist
militants of a Wahhabi extremist trend in Palestine. Loyal to his political
line of focusing on an Islamic struggle within the Palestinian territories
and not outside of Palestine, he did not even call on the CheIslamists
to carry out operations against Israeli targets.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>The Chechen announcements seem to have been more in the nature of propaganda
than a real threat to Israel. The difficulties faced by the militants fighting
a guerilla war against vastly superior Russian forces, together with the
onset of winter make it unlikely that they will have forces to spare for
the Palestinian conflict in the immediate future.
<p>However, the growing influence of the Arab elements in the Chechen struggle,
and the support of bin Laden’s Front for their struggle means that we cannot
totally exclude any possible operations against Israeli or Jewish targets
outside of Israel. Besides their conduct of guerrilla actions against Russian
forces, the Chechen rebels have been blamed for several terrorist operations
in Russia. There is no doubt that they are capable of carrying out more
such operations, both inside Russia and abroad.
<p>International terrorism could give the Chechen militants the international
attention they so far lack. The linking of their struggle to the Palestinian
cause could thus serve as a good basis for them to carry out international
attacks aimed at drawing the world’s attention.
