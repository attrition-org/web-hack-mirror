<p><p>According to the U.S. State Department, Yemen is one of the 10 countries
in the world where Americans are most at risk of being kidnapped. In 1998,
Yemeni tribesmen kidnapped and released more than 60 foreign nationals
for ransom or other reasons.
<p>The Yemeni Government issued a decree in August 1998 making kidnapping
punishable with death. It also prescribed severe penalties for the possession
of unlicensed weapons. In the past, Yemeni tribesmen had also blown up
U.S.-owned oil pipelines and anti-Government opposition groups had bombed
Government targets.
<p>On December 28, 1998, following a call issued by Osama bin Laden, whose
family had migrated to Saudi Arabia from Yemen, for attacks on US and British
targets following the US-UK aerial strikes on Iraq, a till then little
known Islamic organisation called the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army had supported
his anti-U.S. threats and kidnapped 16 Western tourists, including two
Americans. The group called for the establishment of an Islamic state in
Yemen and "an end to the aggression against Iraq and the withdrawal of
the U.S. and British forces from the Gulf region."
<p>When the Yemeni security forces raided the kidnappers' hideout 175 miles
south of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa the next day, three British and one
Australian were shot dead by the kidnappers. Two other hostages, including
an U.S. citizen, were wounded. Three kidnappers were killed in the shootout
and three others, including the ringleader, Zein al-Abideen al-Mehdar,
captured. Two other kidnappers were captured in January 1999.
<p>Subsequent reports indicated that the southern province of Abyan had
emerged as a base for the activities of Yemeni mercenaries belonging to
a group called Jaish-e-Mohammed (Mohammed's Army), which had been trained
by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan, armed by the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the US and the Secret Intelligence Service
(SIS--popularly known as the MI-6) of the UK and used under the leadership
of bin Laden in the USA's proxy war against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan
in the 1980s and that these mercenaries had formed the Aden-Abyan Islamic
Army.
<p>It was also reported that a Yemeni associate of bin Laden, Tariq al-Fadhli,
had established several terrorist training bases in southern Yemen and
that these mercenaries, who had turned against the US and the UK after
the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan, had bombed, in 1992,
two hotels in Yemen where U.S. troops proceeding to Somalia were staying.
The reports also indicated that Maulana Masood Azhar, who was released
by the Government of India on December 31,1999, in response to the demand
of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM) terrorists, who had hijacked an Indian
Airlines plane to Kandahar, had assisted Tariq al-Fadhli in running the
training camps in Yemen.
<p>Before his arrest in 1994, Maulana Masood Azhar belonged to the HUM.
After his release in 1999, he has formed an organisation of his own called
Jaish-e-Mohammed, which has since then been having a number of violent
clashes with the HUM in Pakistani territory. The reasons for the clash
are not known since both belonged to bin Laden's International Islamic
Front For Jehad Against the US and Israel.
<p>Before 1998, the Yemeni members of the Jaish-e-Mohammed also used to
operate under the name Islamic Jihad. The Aden-Abyan Islamic Army was suspected
to be an offshoot of the Yemeni Islamic Jihad. Officers of the USA's Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who had come to Yemen to investigate the
kidnapping incident, were reported to have told the Yemeni authorities
that they suspected a link between the kidnappers and bin Laden. Following
the U.S. bombing of suspected bin Laden's camps in the Sudan and Afghanistan
in August 1998, the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army had issued a threat to attack
U.S. interests in Yemen.
<p>According to the Egyptian authorities, the Yemen-based Islamic Jihad
cells were responsible for the 1993 assassination attempt against the Egyptian
Prime Minister and the 1995 assassination attempt against the Egyptian
President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak. According to Yemeni officials, one of the
kidnappers killed during the shoot-out was an Egyptian wanted in Cairo
on charges of terrorism.
<p>It was also alleged that some of the Yemeni mercenaries, under the leadership
of Maulana Masood Azhar, had participated in the attacks on the US troops
in Somalia in 1993.
<p>Despite strong indications that since 1992 Yemen had become an important
sanctuary, outside Pakistan and Afghanistan, for terrorist elements allied
to bin Laden, the Yemeni Government did not take strong action against
them because these mercenaries under Maulana Masood Azhar had helped the
government troops of President Ali Abdullah Saleh to win Yemen's civil
war in 1994.
<p>The Islamic Jihad group of Yemen, ostensibly unconnected to the Al-Jihad
of Egypt or Palestine, came into being during the pre-unification era when
Aden was the capital of the pro-Soviet Socialist Republic of South Yemen
to oppose the secular policies of the Communist regime in the South.
<p>Under the leadership of Tariq Al-Fadhli, the group, many of whose members
had been to Afghanistan where they received military training and ideological
indoctrination, joined the North Yemeni troops during the war of 1994,
which almost completely wiped out the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) which
sought, but failed, to undo the unity between the two parts of the country.
<p>After the war, the Yemeni Government, having prevailed throughout Yemen
and having weakened its Marxist opponents with the help of the Islamic
Jihad, rewarded Al-Fadhli and several of his followers by admitting them
into the ruling Congress Party, but rejected their demand that the members
of the Islamic Jihad should be recruited to the Army and given appropriate
ranks. Zein al-Abideen al-Mehdar (known also as Abu-Hassan) and others
turned down offers of civilian posts. This led to a parting of the ways
between the Government and the Islamic Jihad.
<p>When the Government refused, fearing their negative influence on the
rest of the army, the group opened an unauthorised military training camp
in the province of Abyan, from where most of its members came, and changed
its name as the Aden- Abyan Islamic Army.
<p>The five captured kidnappers -- Yemeni Zein al-Abideen al-Mehdar, known
as Abu Hassan, 28, Ahmed Mohammad Ali Atef, 26, Saad Mohammad Ali Atef,
18, Saleh al-Junaidy, and Mohammed Saleh Abu Huraira -- were charged with
kidnapping and murder and forming an extremist Islamic group with the aim
of harming Yemen's security and safety.
<p>At his trial in January 1999, Abu Hassan admitted that he was the "managing
mind" for the kidnapping operation and that he had ordered his men to kill
the tourists if the security forces approached their hideout. According
to "The Times" of London, he told the court: "I did everything in the name
of God so I am sorry for nothing.... I am very famous now, but let everyone
know I only gave orders to kill the men, not the women.... My pistol jammed.
If I could have shot more, I would have done so." When asked about the
kidnappers who had escaped, Abu Hassan said, "I hope those who are at large
will continue the Jihad... I hope God strikes you all."
<p>In February 1999, Abu Hassan told the court that his group had planned
other anti-Western operations including an attack on a church and that
he was not sorry for the death of a single Christian.
<p>It came out during the investigation and trial that earlier, on December
24, 1998, the Yemeni authorities had arrested five British nationals (all
Muslims) and a French-Algerian on charges of planning a series of bombings
in Aden during the Christmas-New Year's holiday. Allegedly found with weapons
and explosives, the six suspects were reported to have been recruited,
trained and armed by al-Mehdar in a plot to attack the British Consulate,
the Christchurch Anglican church and two hotels used by Western tourists,
in retaliation for the US-UK air strikes on Iraq. In January 1999, four
more alleged members of the bombing gang, three Britons (all Muslims) and
a French-Algerian, were captured at what was described by the Yemeni authorities
as a terrorist training camp in Shabwa, 240 miles northeast of Aden.
<p>According to the Yemeni authorities, the bombing suspects were recruited
in Britain in July 1998 by a London-based Mullah called Abu Hamza al-Masri
(real name Mustafa Kamil), an Afghanistan war veteran, who was the leader
of an Islamic organization in London called the Supporters of Sharia (SOS).
He was originally an Egyptian national, but obtained the British nationality
by marrying a British woman, whom he later divorced. It also emerged that
the entire kidnapping was aimed at securing the release of this group.
<p>Abu Hamza used to deliver incendiary sermons from the Finsbury mosque
in northern London, denouncing the "Great Satan" (the US) and all who helped
it and calling for U.S. planes to be blown up in mid-air by "flying mines
hanging from balloons." According to the "Christian Science Monitor" of
the US, in a television interview in January 1999, he said that he supported
violent actions if they were carried out "for the sake of God" and to end
" state terrorism by Britain and the United States." It was alleged by
some observers that Abu Hamza was running weekend military training camps
for Islamic youth in Britain, including for volunteers to go to Kashmir,
with the help of former British army officers and that the British authorities
did not take any action against him since he had actively collaborated
with the SIS in Afghanistan against the Soviet troops.
<p>According to Yemeni officials, two of the British bombing suspects were
related to Abu Hamza: Mustapha Kamal, 17, being his son, and Mohsin Ghalain,
18, being his stepson. At the kidnapping trial, Zein al-Abideen al-Mehdar
described how he used to send statements to Abu Hamza in London to be passed
on to the media and, according to press reports, Abu Hamza too admitted
being in contact with the kidnappers and warned of reprisal attacks if
al-Mehdar was executed after the trial.
<p>In January 1999, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh officially asked
the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, to arrest and hand over Abu
Hamza al-Masri to be tried in Yemen for instigating terrorist acts in Yemen
and other Arab states.
<p>In March 1999, British authorities arrested Abu Hamza along with two
others in London and held them in custody for a few days under Britain's
Prevention of Terrorism Act. They were released on bail pending further
inquiries.
<p>During the trial of the 10 bombing suspects, which began in April 1999,one
of the suspects, Shahid Bat, a Briton of Pakistani origin, told the Yemeni
court that he had received military training in Yemen before his arrest,
but claimed that he was not planning any violent activities in Yemen. Bat
also testified that Abu Hamza had recruited him at the London mosque he
attended and sent him for military training to Yemen so that he could participate
in jehad outside Yemen..
<p>Mohsin Ghalain, Abu Hamza's stepson, reportedly admitted to the Yemeni
authorities that he had received $2,000 from the SOS to detonate bombs
against British and Western targets in Aden. He also admitted meeting with
al-Mehdar. Defendant Malik Nasser Harhra admitted that he was trained in
the use of firearms and explosives at a training camp run by al-Mehdar.
The other suspects, including Abu Hamza's son, confessed to various crimes
as well but later retracted their confessions claiming that they were made
under torture.
<p>In May 1999, the Yemeni court sentenced three of the kidnappers, Zein
al-Abideen al-Mehdar, the self-proclaimed leader of the group, Abdullah
Saleh al-Junaidy and Saleh Abu Huraira, to death for their part in the
abduction and killing of the Western tourists. A fourth defendant, Ahmed
Mohammad Atef, was sentenced to 20 years in jail and a fifth was acquitted,
as were nine others tried in absentia.
<p>After the verdict, al-Mehdar called upon the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army
to resume its holy struggle against the West. At the end of the month,
the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army issued a statement threatening to kill foreigners
if the Government of Yemen carried out the death sentence against its leader
and two of its members. The statement, which was apparently sent to the
media through the SOS, said: "If negotiations fail, all foreigners in Yemen
from Western Ambassadors, experts and doctors to tourists have to leave
Yemen. The Aden-Abyan Islamic Army will not kidnap them but will kill them....
"
<p>In July 1999, Zein al-Abideen al-Mehdar told an Appeals court that he
would order the killings of state officials if the court did not rule according
to the principles of Islamic law.
<p>In London, Abu Hamza told an Arabic newspaper that supporters of the
militants must take revenge if the executions were carried out and added:"I
consider anybody who contributes to the killing of Mehdar as a legitimate
target."
<p>Abu Hamza's fatwas are based by him on the ideology of takfir according
to which all those who do not rule by Shari'ah, are apostates and infidels
who deserve to die.
<p>According to UK-based Islamic scholars, Abu Hamza's connection with
the Yemeni hostage-takers alarmed the Muslim community in Britain more
than it alarmed the British authorities. According to them, his statements,
including several TV and newspaper interviews, only confirmed the fears
of many leading personalities in the British Muslim community that dubious
fringe groups - such as the SOS, the Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Al-Muhajiroun led
by Omar Bakri - and extremist individuals - such as Abu Hamza and Omar
Bakri - through the propagation of irrational ideas and the instigation
of violence made the Muslim community as a whole suspect in the eyes of
the ordinary British people.
<p>According to these scholars, what worries the Muslims in Britain is
that individuals like Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri, also like Abu Qatadah (al-Falastini)
and Abu Mus`ab (as-Suri) before them, issue fatwas which misguide small
groups of frustrated young Muslims, mostly non-Arabs, who lack knowledge
of the Arabic language and who have not had the right guidance nor the
appropriate training in Islamic knowledge. It is as a result of the work
of these persons that such young men as those now detained in Yemen have
been embroiled in futile and harmful activities believing what they set
out to achieve to be Jihad in the cause of Allah.
<p>These scholars also express their surprise over the perceived inaction
of the British authorities in connection with the activities of these extremist
and irrational individuals. Abu Hamza had expressed public support for
the killing of British nationals in Yemen and Omar Bakri for the 1998 bombings
in Nairobi and Daressalam. The latter is also alleged to have once issued
- in public - a death sentence against the former British Prime Minister,
Mr. John Major. They suspect that in view of the past association of these
extremists with the SIS in Afghanistan in the 1980s and their assistance
to the SIS in smuggling heroin to the Soviet troops, the British authorities
find it difficult to act against them.
<p>The leader of the Islamic Army of Aden Abyan, Zein al-Abideen al-Mehdar,
was executed by a firing squad on October 17,1999, after the rejection
of his appeal. The three other defendants each received 20-year prison
sentences. In a separate case, a Yemeni court convicted in August, 1999,
10 terrorists--eight Britons and two Algerians--of conspiring to commit
terrorist acts, including attacks targeting US citizens.
<p>Before the rejection of the appeal, the Aden Abyan Islamic Army had
warned the Ambassadors of the US and the UK to leave Yemen immediately,
threatening a strike that ``will be painful for the enemies of Islam.''
The warning was made in a hand-written statement sent to the Saudi-owned,
London-based "al-Hayat" newspaper by the Army. It was signed by ``Abu al-Mohsen,''
supposedly the new Amir of the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army.
<p>Despite these threats, the US authorities have been developing close
relations with the Yemeni Govt. in order to obtain naval base facilities
in the country. Last year, the Yemeni authorities arrested Mr.Abdul-Latif
Omar, Editor of the weekly "Al Haq" and Assistant Secretary-General of
the opposition Sons of Yemen League, after he published an article alleging
that the US had been provided military base facilities on the Soqatra Island.
They strongly denied this, but, however, released him after some time.
<p>"The Times" of London reported on June 1,1999, that the American military
chiefs feared that the terrorist violence in Yemen might jeopardise their
secret deal with the Yemeni authorities to establish an important naval
base at Aden. It said that the Pentagon planned to use the former British
colony to bunker 600,000 barrels of marine diesel and aviation fuel which
would be used to service its naval operations in the Gulf against President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq and that the first US warship docked in Aden under
the deal in May, 1999. The paper quoted a senior US official as saying:
"This eruption of Islamic terrorism in Yemen could not have come at a worse
time, when we are considering hundreds of American military personnel walking
around Aden on shore leave."
<p>The paper also reported as follows: "The US Navy needs the (Aden) port
because it is closing its operation at Djibouti and the Pentagon is worried
about the future use of bases in Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia. The
fuel bunker is being constructed by British technicians next to the terminal
for the new Aden Freeport that will open in March. The US base should have
been operating by now, but the first fuel is not due in the tanks until
next month. The Americans also want to refurbish a nearby refinery so that
it can produce the quality of marine diesel and aviation fuel they need
to store. "&nbsp;&nbsp; It added: "American sources said that they will
review plans to allow sailors and airmen shore leave during daylight; the
decision will upset local traders and bar owners who had expected business
not seen since the British occupation. American security officials, conscious
of the security threat in the region, wanted to train units of Yemeni troops
in hostage rescue, but were forbidden to do so by American diplomats concerned
about the Sanaa Government's human rights record. Washington was also unimpressed
by Yemen's recent criticism of Operation Desert Fox against Saddam. US
officials thought that President Saleh's Government had learnt its lesson
after condemning the Gulf War and then seeing two million Yemenis expelled
from Gulf states and the cutting of Western aid. British authorities are
believed to have asked Yemen about using its former barracks at Fuqum in
Little Aden as the West seeks bases in the Gulf."
<p>The terrorist violence against US and UK interests in Yemen and other
places is orchestrated by bin Laden from his base in Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan, which is today a veritable Pakistani colony. The Taliban is
a phantom consciously created by the Pakistani military through its religious
allies for assuming and maintaining control of Afghan territory. The obscurantist
religious fervour of the Taliban, which has alarmed and antagonised the
West, has assumed a certain independent momentum of its own beyond the
control of the Pakistani military-intelligence establishment. Despite the
long-term negative implications of this fervour for Pakistan itself (dangers
of Talibanisation), Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment is prepared
to go along with it so long as the Taliban serves its strategic interests.
<p>Sections of the Pakistani elite and political leadership look upon Afghanistan
as a bridge to the Central Asian Republics (CARs) and Pakistan's suzerainty
over Afghanistan as a means of facilitating the emergence of Pakistan as
the commercial gateway of the CARs, but the military-intelligence leadership
looks upon it as a strategic and tactical tool in its proxy war with India.
Control over Afghan territory provides the long-sought-after strategic
depth. It also meets the post-1993 need for a deniable means of involvement
in Kashmir from sanctuaries in Afghan territory from behind the cloak of
the Taliban. In Pakistan's cloak and dagger war in Kashmir, the dagger
is of Islamabad, but the cloak is of the Taliban and its religious mentors
in Pakistan.
<p>It suits Pakistan that the rest of the world has started looking upon
Afghanistan and not Pakistan as the hub of jehadi terrorism and the Taliban
as the villain. The real villain is Pakistan. Afghanistan is just a manipulated
appendage. Nothing happens and can happen in Afghanistan without the knowledge,
complicity and involvement of the Pakistani military-intelligence establishment.
Since the imposition of the UN sanctions against the Taliban in November,
1999, inter alia, banning all flights to and from Afghanistan, no jehadi,
whether from Yemen, Southern Philippines, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, China,
the CARS or Russia, can go to the Taliban's camps without the knowledge
of and facilitation by the Pakistani military-intelligence establishment.
In view of the Northern Alliance's active presence, if not control, over
the areas bordering the CARs and the presence of the Russian troops there,
it would be very difficult for the jehadi terrorist aspirants from Russia
and the CARs to cross over into Taliban-controlled territory. Almost all
non-Indian jehadi terrorists reportedly go to either Saudi Arabia under
the pretext of Umra or to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as tourists and
are taken from there to the Taliban camps for training through Pakistan
with the knowledge and assistance of the Pakistani military-intelligence
establishment. It is not clear how the weapons are reached to them. The
use of LTTE ships is a strongly-suspected possibility.
<p>Pakistan's colonisation of Afghanistan serves an economic purpose too.
Afghanistan serves as a rear base for the cultivation of opium, extraction
of heroin from the poppy gum and its use as a valuable foreign exchange
earner, without evidence of Pakistan's direct involvement in the heroin
trade. It is doubtful whether Pakistan's economy would have been able to
survive the 1990 (Pressler Amendment) and the 1998 (post-Chagai) economic
sanctions and the May 1999 suspension of IMF assistance for so long without
the inflow of the heroin dollars. It is the heroin oxygen, which has apparently
been keeping the comatose Pakistani economy alive without collapse for
so long.
<p>The geographical hub of the activities of bin Laden and his supporters
against other countries may be in Afghanistan, but the brain centre is
in Islamabad. Unless the US acts against this brain centre by declaring
Pakistan as a State-sponsor of international terrorism and imposing total
economic sanctions against it and by destroying the opium fields and heroin
refineries of Afghanistan, it would continue to lose the precious lives
of its military personnel and other innocent citizens at the hands of Afghan-based
and ISI-nursed Jehadi terrorists.
