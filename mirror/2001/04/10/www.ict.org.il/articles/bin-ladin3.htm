<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar-es-Salam - Commentary</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>By Dr. Ely Karmon,</B>
<BR><B>ICT Senior Research Scholar</B>

<P><B>Background</B>
<BR>For the moment there are no real clues leading to the group or organization
responsible for the murderous terrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania against
the American embassies, which took the lives of so many innocents--Africans
and Americans.

<P>It will take time to decipher the incident due to the modus operandi
used--a car-bomb that is completely destroyed in the blast. Added to this
is the desire of the orchestrators of the attack to remain unpunished,
and therefore not to take responsibility for the attack. It must be remembered
that there is as yet no clear-cut answer as to who was directly responsible
for similar bombings in the past--the bombing of the American Marines camp
in Beirut in 1983, or the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992.

<P>Still it is possible to make an evaluation as to who could have the ideological,
strategic and political interest and the operational capabilities to launch
such a coordinated and well-planned attack. However, it should be stressed
that this is only an initial evaluation which is not based on hard facts
and that it will take time to find the answers to the many questions raised
by the two terrorist attacks.

<P>What is certain is that no African group or organization could be behind
such an operation. In addition, unlike the case in Oklahoma City, it is
very improbable that an extremist American right-wing group would go so
far to “revenge” the McVeigh trial or to “punish” the American government.
The American militias never acted on the international arena and they are
present mainly on the local level.

<P>So far there has only been one claim to responsibility registered by
the media. The London <I>Al-Hayyat</I> reported on Saturday that it received
a call late on Friday from an unknown Islamic group claiming responsibility
for two bomb attacks. It said the caller was speaking in an Arabic dialect
that was not Egyptian, and that he claimed to be a spokesman for a group
called "The Liberation Army of the Islamic Sanctuaries." <I>Al-Hayyat</I>,
said that the caller did not state where the group was based, describe
its nature, or give the nationalities of its members.

<P>The Middle Eastern track remains indeed the most plausible one and there
are several possible scenarios.

<P>After the trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, of six of his followers
and of Ramzi Youssef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing
in New York (in January 1998), several anonymous threats against the United
States were reported.

<P>In February 1998, false bomb alerts were received at the US embassy
in Caracas, Venezuela. In March 1998, the American school in Amman, Jordan
was damaged by an explosive device. And finally, in June 1998, according
to the London <I>Al-Hayyat</I> newspaper, Islamic militants were arrested
in Egypt and accused of plotting to kidnap Americans in Egypt in order
to gain the release of Sheikh Abdel Rahman.

<P><B>The Osama bin Ladin track</B>
<BR>The most oft-cited factor with the potential to have orchestrated
such a sophisticated attack is <a href="../articles/bin-ladin.htm">Osama bin Ladin.</a>  The Saudi millionaire considered
to be the ideologue and the financier--the “heart and soul”--of many Islamic
extremist groups active in the Middle East; groups that are directed from
Afghanistan and Pakistan.

<P>Beginning in February of this year many reports in the Arab and Pakistani
press stated that the U.S. authorities were conducting a serious international
effort to obtain the extradition of bin Ladin from Afghanistan.

<P>The Rawalpindi <I>Jang</I> reported on 31 March that special commandos
of the American CIA and FBI have arrived in Pakistan to arrest Osama bin
Ladin of Saudi Arabia and Abdul Basit of Libya. According to informed diplomatic
sources, the US agencies had decided to arrest Osama bin Ladin and Abdul
Basit after the receipt of faxed messages from Osama bin Ladin to the US
Embassy in Islamabad and the US consulates in Peshawar, Lahore, and Karachi,
threatening to target U.S. facilities and US citizens at any time. Following
this threat, security was tightened around the U.S. Embassy, consulates,
banks, and other facilities.

<P>The same newspaper reported again in mid-April that the United States
had made vigorous efforts to arrest Osama bin Ladin. As a result, Osama
bin Ladin's security arrangements were further tightened. The permanent
representative for the U.S. at the UN, Bill Richardson, visited Afghanistan
on 17<SUP>th</SUP> April to hold talks with the Taliban on the issue. According
to Afghan sources, the United States increased its efforts to obtain Osama's
arrest after bin Ladin's alleged threats to the US diplomatic missions
in Pakistan. The Taliban government has provided special security guards
for bin Ladin, who is staying in Qandahar Province in Afghanistan.

<P>&nbsp;The London <I>Al-Sharq al-Awsat</I> reported on 26 February 1998
that the Egyptian <a href="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18">“Jihad Group -- Armed Vanguards of Conquests”</a>  [<I>jama'at
al-jihad -- tala'i' al-fath al-islami</I>] has called on the “World Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Americans” [<I>al-jabhah al-islamiyah
al-'alamiyah li jihad al-yahud wa al-amrican</I>], proclaimed recently
from Afghanistan, to expand its membership in order to include the other
tendencies on the scene and draw up new strategies suitable for the stage
ahead. A statement issued by the group in question, signed by its secretary
general 'Abdallah Mansur, and entitled “A Step Forward and in the Right
Direction, ” says: “The time has come for us to move from hasty thinking
based on [emotional] reactions and fighting non-enemies, and hence exhausting
almost all our energies, to strategic thinking that takes account of rules
of defense and the ability to adapt and develop. Because without that,
the outcome is a total freeze [<I>tajammud</I>].” The statement cited the
necessity to “form a higher committee that represents all colors of the
fundamentalist movement wishing to join such an alliance in the Arab and
Islamic worlds, in addition to drawing up mechanisms for implementing and
focusing on these aims while earnestly working to eliminate all psychological
barriers among the various <I>jihad</I> forces and tendencies in order
to close ranks against falsehood and its party [<I>hizbuh</I>].”

<P>The statement gave its blessing to the inclusion of the Islamic Group
and the <I>Jihad</I> Group in the “World Islamic Front for <I>Jihad</I>
Against Jews and Americans.” The announcement of the formation of the front
by leaders of the <I>Jihad</I> Group and the  <a href="../inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=18"> “Armed Islamic Group”</a> [<I>al-jama'ah
al-islamiyah al-musallahah</I>] has provoked widespread reactions, especially
as these leaders issued a <a href="../articles/fatwah.htm"><I>fatwa</I></a> to the effect that “killing the
Americans and their allies is an individual duty for every Muslim.”

<P>The founder members of the Front include Saudi oppositionist Osama bin
Ladin; Dr. Ayman al- Zawahiri, leader of the Egyptian <I>Jihad</I>; Rifa'i
Ahmad Taha, a leader of the Islamic Group whose name was much mentioned
in connection with the al-Dir al-Bahri massacre in Luxor in November 1997,which
claimed the lives of 58 tourists; and some leaders of extremist fundamentalist
movements in Pakistan.

<P>On May 28, 1998 the Islamabad daily, <I>The News</I> reported that Osama
bin Ladin had announced the formation of an International Islamic Front
for <I>Jihad</I> against America and Israel. Talking to a group of journalists
who had traveled from Pakistan to meet him at his base in Khost in southern
Afghanistan, he said leaders of Islamic movements in several countries,
including Pakistan had evinced interest in joining the front. He stated
that Dr Aiman Al-Zawahiri, leader of the Jamaat-ul-<I>Jihad</I> in Egypt
who was present at the time, had played a crucial role in launching the
front.

<P>Bin Ladin justified the formation of the anti-American and anti-Israeli
front by arguing that Muslims everywhere in the world were suffering at
the hands of the U.S. and Israel. He said the Muslims must wage holy war
against their real enemies not only to rid themselves of unpopular regimes
backed by the Americans and Israelis but also protect their faith. When
a reporter maintained that bin Ladin and his colleagues could not possibly
take on the world's onlsuperpower, bin Ladin contended that the US was
vulnerable and could be defeated in war. This would happen in the same
way as the USSR suffered humiliation at the hands of the Afghan and Arab
“mujahideen” in Afghanistan and was eventually dismembered

<P>On 14 May 1998, The London <I>Al-Quds al-'Arabi</I> published an article
to the effect that clerics in Afghanistan had issued a <I>fatwa</I> stipulating
the necessity to move U.S. forces out of the Gulf region. Addressing Muslims
the world-over, the Afghan ulema said: “The enemies of Islam are not limited
to a certain group or party; all atheists are enemies of Islam, and they
take one another as friends.” The Afghan ulema declared “<I>jihad</I> --
based on the rules of the Shari'ah -- against the United States and its
followers.” They urged Islamic governments to perform the duty of “armed
<I>jihad</I> against the enemies of Islam,” pointing out that “if Muslims
are lax in their responsibility, the enemies of Islam will occupy the two
holy mosques as well, just as they occupied the al- Aqsa Mosque.” They
stressed, in a statement attached to the <I>fatwa</I>, that: “This <I>fatwa</I>--with
the evidence and the rulings issued by early and current ulema, on which
it is based--is not merely a <I>fatwa</I> issued by the ulema of a Muslim
country, but rather a religious <I>fatwa</I> that every Muslim should adopt
and work under.”

<P>The Islamabad daily, <I>The News</I> commented on 15 June 1998, that
until May 1996, the Arabs who had taken refuge in Afghanistan after the
end of the Afghan “<I>jihad</I>” lacked a leader and a well thought-out
agenda. The arrival of Osama bin Ladin, a Saudi dissident--accused on May
18, 1996 by certain Arab and Western governments of being a financier of
an Islamic international army in Afghanistan--helped solve both their problems.
The normally fractious Afghanistan-based Arabs not only found a resourceful
leader and a rallying point but also someone who is very clear about his
objectives. This was very much in evidence when he recently announced the
launching of an International Islamic Front for <I>Jihad</I> Against America
and Israel.

<P>There are probably a few hundred Arab volunteers still living in Afghanistan.
They are the leftovers of the several thousand Arabs who came to Afghanistan
via Pakistan in the 1980s to take part in the “<I>jihad</I>” against the
USSR's Red Army and the Afghan communists. Those left behind have nowhere
else to go because they risk being caught should they venture to return
home. No other country would be willing to accept them. In any case, present-day
Afghanistan continues to be their safest hideaway. The ones who have returned
to their countries have mostly joined the political and military struggle
aimed at bringing an Islamic change there. Known as Arab-Afghans, these
battle-hardened Islamists have come to be known as the most radical and
dangerous of the fighters who have taken up arms against the Algerian and
Egyptian governments.

<P>The Paris <I>al-Watan al-'Arabi</I> estimated on 26 June 1998, that
“the fact that bin-Ladin has shown up again in the press clearly indicates
his emergence as a leader of the revolutionary council that was eventually
established.” According to the newspaper, a Dutch official, who closely
follows developments in the new Islamic Front, in cooperation with European
organs, believes that relations were actually reorganized among the organizations--which
used to cooperate and coordinate with each other on the organizational
and logistical levels--on a new basis that gives an organizational working
configuration to past relations. This is a new and important development.
According to the Dutch official, this confirms the seriousness of this
event, which requires larger and more accurate coordination between the
European and U.S. authorities. It also calls for cooperation by some of
the Middle Eastern authorities.

<P>The organizations whose membership in the Islamic Front was announced
are the Egyptian <I>Jihad</I>, the Egyptian Armed Group, the Pakistan Scholars
Society, the Partisans Movement in Kashmir, the <I>Jihad</I> Movement in
Bangladesh, and the Afghan military wing of the “Advice and Reform” commission
led by Osama bin Ladin. All these organizations once cooperated and coordinated
with one another, but without any specific configuration or mechanism for
such cooperation. Moreover, each of these organizations had freedom of
action, and they determined their own objectives independently. Cooperation
among these organizations was only at the level of “those who carry arms,”
which is one of the organizational levels of each organization. There were
no means of cooperation and coordination among “the people of the call,”
another of the organizational levels. This is due to the fact that Afghanistan
enhanced relations among the “carriers of arms” and created a kind of interpersonal
cohesion.

<P>According to this evaluation, the threat posed by this new front is
due to the fact that it combines all the organizational levels, by establishing
a shura [consultative] council. According to most assessments, this council
is led by Osama Bin Ladin. This increases the front's effectiveness. It
can be said that the Islamic Front has now moved from the constituent and
organizational phase to the operational phase.

<P>It is interesting that only last month, the U.S. State Department published
a <A HREF="http://travel.state.gov/mideast_announce.html">public announcement</A>
to the effect that Osama bin Ladin's threats against American interests
should be taken seriously.

<P><B>The Iranian track</B>
<BR>Since the advent<B> </B>of the Khatami government<B> </B>there is hope
in the West and the U.S. that<B> </B>the new president will change the
aggressive Iranian policy of supporting and sponsoring international terrorism.
However, on the issue of terrorism, the signs in Iran are conflicting.

<P>Khatami declared that Iran continues to oppose Arab-Israeli negotiations
and depicted Israel as a racist, expansionist, and terrorist state. The
flow of weapons to Hizballah in Lebanon is continuing and Iran is still
providing the Palestinian terrorist groups with funds and military training.
Representatives of terror groups recently met in Tehran to coordinate their
activities with Iran. At the end of 1997 a German convert to Islam recruited
by a top Hizballah cadre trained in Iran, was sent to Israel to perpetrate
acts of terror in Tel-Aviv. Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the speaker of the Iranian
parliament declared that he hoped Moslems would kill British author Salman
Rushdie.

<P>Iranian hard-liners will certainly attempt to maintain the ideologically
aggressive foreign policy founded by Ayatollah Khomeini. Their recent steps
to confront President Khatami and his supporters are but the beginning
of a long struggle concerning the nature of the regime and its policies.
Anything goes in the attempt to sabotage Khatami's attempts to open the
regime at home and moderate its foreign policy. The hard-liners still control
the military and the intelligence apparatuses and have the blessing of
the spiritual leader Khamene’i. One of their options would be to wage provocative
acts of terror in order to sabotage the policy of the president and stop
the process of detente with the United States opened several months ago.

<P><B>The Iraqi track</B>
<BR>Iraq banned surprise checks by the UN-affiliated nuclear agency and
halted a team of UN inspectors, telling them they can only monitor sites
already checked. The moves follow President Saddam’s decision to freeze
cooperation with UN weapons inspectors and the International Atomic Energy
Agency on the question of the control of its non-conventional weapons programs.

<P>The Associated Press reported that on August 8, President Saddam Hussein
declared the that the United States will reap nothing but a “harvest ...
full of thorns” from its campaign against Iraq. “Those imposing aggression
on Iraq ... are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full of
thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.”

<P>In the past the Iraqis have tried already to assassinate ex-US president
Bush during his visit to Kuwait. Although this is a low probability scenario,
the nature of the Iraqi regime and its aggressive policy vis-a-vis the
UN teams and the embargimposed on it could push it to an act of international
terror in order to weaken the American administration’s position and firmness
in dealing with Iraq’s disarmament from non-conventional weapons.

<P><B>The Sudani track</B>
<BR>This is also a low-probability scenario, due to the moderation the
Sudan government has shown in recent years in its policy of support to
international terrorism. According to the US State Department, Sudan has
taken some positive steps on terrorism during 1997, but it still has not
complied with UN Security Council resolutions that demand an end to Sudanese
support for terrorism and the extradition of the three suspects involved
with the 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian President Mubarak
in Addis Ababa. Moreover, Sudan continues to allow its territory to be
used for safe-haven, training, and transit by terrorists.

<P>It is therefore possible that some Islamic extremist group present in
Sudan could be involved in the terrorist attacks in neighboring Kenya and
Tanzania, although this would extremely damage Sudan’s relations with its
neighbors.
