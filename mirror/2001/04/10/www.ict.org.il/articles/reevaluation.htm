<BR><B>ICT Academic Director</B>

<P><I>The views expressed here represent solely those of the author</I>

<P>On the background of the many threats by Hamas to avenge the killing
of the Awadallah brothers on September 11<SUP>th</SUP> and to renew its
terrorist activity in Israel, it is of interest to note some conflicting
voices in the Islamic movement. On September 8<SUP>th</SUP>, two days before
the Awadallah incident, one of the leading ideologues of Hamas, Munir Shafiq,
published an article in the weekly <I>Al-Sabeel</I> (the organ of the Jordanian
Muslim Brotherhood) calling for a reevaluation of the movement’s use of
terrorism.

<P>Shafiq is himself an interesting character and is highly respected in
Islamic circles throughout the Arab world. Once a Christian Marxist from
Jerusalem, he was at one time an active member of Naif Hawatmeh’s Democratic
People’s Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DPFLP). In 1980-81 he converted
to Islam under the influence of both the Islamic revolution in Iran and
of the French philosopher Roger Garaudy, a fellow Marxist and one of the
veteran leaders of the French Communist Party. In the 1980s Shafiq was
the head of the Fath Planning Center in Tunisia, as well as an active member
of one of the factions of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and in recent
years a member of Hamas. He is one of the few Palestinian Islamists who
publish ideological material, and therefore he is both influential and
respected by many of the Islamic movements. He has a permanent column in
<I>Al-Sabeel</I> and <I>Filastin al-Muslimah</I>.

<P>In his weekly article on September 8<SUP>th</SUP>, he closely examined
the Islamist policy of terrorism. The article is important and we quote
it here in full translation:

<P><B>Munir Shafiq</B>&nbsp;

<P>Military operations that lead to the killing of civilians unconnected
to the events on the battlefield itself are improper.&nbsp;

<P>From the 1960s onward, it would have been preferable not to commit hijackings
of airplanes and assassinations. Nor should the battle have been extended
to the rest of the world. This is true for a variety of reasons. To begin
with, there is insufficient reason to use terrorism against those who merely
indirectly support and aid the enemy. Then there is the retaliation of
the enemy--killing of innocents and assassinations, in which the whole
world becomes the battleground for his actions and for the attacks against
his enemies.&nbsp;

<P>We should admit here that this last reason is the strongest. Retaliation
for a terror attack often uses the same means as the attack, justified
as self-defense or pre-emptive action. This is the reaction of the security
forces of most of the countries in the world, especially the super powers
like the United States and the former Soviet Union.&nbsp;

<P>Naturally, in the history of the Jewish State, the “Mossad” and the
“Shin Bet” exhibit--much more than any other country--such violent operations
against civilians, as well as assassinations. But, for those whose cause
is just--those who fight against foreign occupation or those who promote
an ideological and civilized mission as a political alternative to the
unjust and arbitrary policies of most of the world--it is vital to reexamine
those motivations. They sometimes must relinquish those means that tend
to turn active and widespread terrorism into a tool in the hands of the
strong and the stronger. For the result is that the weak or the oppressed
use this method against their own interests without real affect or results.&nbsp;

<P>This is because the fundamental power of those with an ideological and
civilized mission--mainly the Islamists with faith in Allah--is the power
of persuasion and the ability to become a popular force composed of millions.
And this is due to the characteristics and nature of that mission. The
aggressors or the racists have no route to the heart of the people--the
multitude--and therefore they must use power, violence and terrorism. But,
those who confront them with a just and alternative mission have no way
to power but through the hearts of the people. And when they make their
move and display their wishes, they gain the upper hand, resulting in a
revolution in all dimensions of life, including in military matters and
the real balance of power in the conflict.&nbsp;

<P>Terrorism--with the exception of resistance to occupation--is the activity
against civilian institutions or directly against individuals, assassinations,
hijacking or taking hostages. It is classified as terrorist according to
an American “ideological terrorism,” especially when it comes to operations
considered by the United States to be terrorist ones. Analyzing the issue
of terrorism; the exaggeration in its condemnation; the attempt to be seen
as pure and politically correct, due to the fear of being seen as indifferent
to terrorism--all these do not serve the cause but will result in encouraging
terrorism. This is due to the fact that whatever is based on fear or done
under pressure, can be erased by courage. It can be dealt with the same
way as we deal with the state-sponsored terrorism of the United States
or other super power--a kind of terrorism based on manipulating phrases
and words, under the influence of the American ideological and propaganda
terrorism. This does not serve the cause either, because it negates the
fear that had brought about this arrogance in the first place.&nbsp;

<P>The best way is to deal with the subject of terrorism directly, on the
one hand without ambivalence, and on the other hand with courage. The disapproval
of the methods that legally, principally and politically, come under the
term terrorism, is inappropriate to those who live in glass houses while
perpetrating acts of terrorism.&nbsp;

<P>The means of change should deal with the goals, the principles and the
values of the cause. They should consider also the balance of power and
the general and special circumstances of the subject. They should not be
the result of reaction or being pushed to the corner.&nbsp;</TD>

<P>Munir Shafiq’s article is extraordinary, and is unique in the worldview
of Hamas or other radical Islamists, both Palestinians and other Arabs.
It actually calls for a different look at terrorism on one hand, and for
a “cleaner” struggle without being contaminated by the “filth” of terrorism
as perceived by Western culture. We can sum up what Shafiq says in plain
words:

<P>Terrorism is the weapon of the aggressor, the super powers whose ideals
are arbitrary and unjust. The Islamists, charged with the divine mission
of social justice should not adopt the means of terrorism. Moreover, Hamas
as a movement that confronts occupation, should use guerrilla warfare rather
than terrorism--fighting against military personnel and not civilians.
(See also the <A HREF="define.htm#attitude">relevant chapter in Defining
Terrorism</A>, by Boaz Ganor)

<P>Shafiq may reflect here a possible change in Hamas since the return
of Sheikh Yassin to Gaza on October 1997, a change not yet recognized by
observers of the Islamic movement. The change is in the direction of the
institutionalization of the movement while adjusting to the undoubted rule
of the Palestinian Authority. Sheikh Yassin two-month tour of in the Arab
world may be another factor in a process. The leadership of the movement
under Yassin as free man living in Gaza under Arafat’s rule, is leaning
toward a more political attitude, or at least taking the political situation
into consideration to a greater extent in its decisions. The tone of Yassin’s
speeches concerning Israel has not changed at all. However, in a number
of recent pamphlets and statements of the movement--especially those who
originating in Gaza rather than in Jordan--he places the responsibility
for confronting Israel on the Palestinian Authority and not on Hamas’ fighters.

<P>The Islamic movement of Hamas is certainly not going to abandon terrorism
in the near future. However it might change the methods of terrorism to
conform more to those appropriate to an institutionalized movement confronting
Israel in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority. This means that its
terrorism may be “limited” to those means and targets acceptable to the
Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian public-- mainly<B> soldiers and
Jewish settlers. </B>Terrorism against soldiers and particularly against
settlers still has the moral support of many Palestinians. Such terrorist
acts were not condemned in the past year by Arafat or his officials. This
gives these acts an official legitimacy on the part of the Palestinian
public, which may encourage Hamas to use them while fashioning of new image
for a movement as a political--rather than a terrorist--movement.
