        <p>The Hamas movement is an offshoot of the Moslem

        Brotherhood in the Israeli-administered territories, or

        as defined in the second and fifth articles of the Hamas

        Charter: &quot;Hamas - the Islamic Resistance Movement -

        is a division of the Moslem Brotherhood in Palestine. The

        Moslem Brotherhood is international and the largest of

        the Islamic movements in the modern era...The Islamic

        Resistance Movement is a specifically Palestinian

        movement. Its loyalty is to Allah and its commitment is

        to Islam as a way of life&quot;. </p>

        <p>The Moslem Brotherhood in the territories was formed

        during the years 1967-1977, when the Islamic-religious

        forces joined ranks, under the aegis of similar groups in

        Arab countries (mainly Jordan and Egypt), to form a

        single movement. In 1978 the movement, led by Sheikh

        Ahmed Yassin, registered as a non-profit organization

        called the Moujama. From its founding until the

        mid-1980s, the Moslem Brotherhood concentrated its

        activities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza upon recruitment

        and dissemination of Islamic values among Palestinians in

        general and among the youth in particular. To achieve

        these goals, the movement strove to gain control of

        centers of influence and education, primarily mosques,

        universities and schools. </p>

        <p>The Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba (October 1988) described

        Moslem Brotherhood activities during this period:

        &quot;During the years 1967-1975 the role of the Islamic

        movement was characterized by the building of mosques,

        bringing the [younger] generation into the fold,

        providing them with guidance and strengthening their

        ideology. To this end, the movement utilized all means at

        its disposal. The mosque, therefore, did not serve solely

        as a place of worship, but also as school, kindergarten,

        or even library or venue for women&#146;s activities.

        Ideology and religion were preached at clubs, schools and

        universities, where mosques were often built and politics

        discussed. In this fashion the [younger] generation

        opened its eyes and discovered the Jewish plots against

        the nation.&quot; </p>

        <p>Following the assassination of Egyptian President

        Sadat, many Palestinians, members of the Moslem

        Brotherhood studying at Egypt&#146;s Islamic

        universities, were deported. These students, who

        strengthened the foundations of the Moslem Brotherhood in

        the territories (particularly in Gaza), soon integrated

        into the educational system and the universities in the

        territories, recruiting others to the movement&#146;s

        religious-fundamentalist ideology. </p>

        <p><a name="Born with the Intifada"><font size="4">Born

        with the Intifada</font></a> </p>

        <p>On the eve of the intifada, the Moslem Brotherhood

        twice used the name &quot;Hamas&quot; for its operations.

        On the first occasion, a leaflet was distributed in the

        Gaza Strip (March 1987) decrying the use and sale of

        drugs and was directed at pharmacists and drug dealers

        who &quot;currupt youth.&quot; The second leaflet signed

        by Hamas, included detailed instructions on how to beware

        of Israeli intelligence in the territories. The Hamas

        movement, however, was actually founded only after the

        outbreak of the intifada. Activists of the Moslem

        Brotherhood, who had until then concentrated primarily on

        religious and educational operations and had refrained

        from openly anti-Israel activities (for fear of IDF

        reprisal and possible restrictions upon the movement),

        came under sharp criticism from among the Palestinians. </p>

        <p>The founding of Hamas - the Islamic Resistance

        Movement - at the beginning of the intifada can be linked

        to a number of factors: </p>

        <p>A) In the mid-1980s, a group of Moslem Brotherhood

        activists broke away to form the Islamic Jihad. This

        organization, which rejected passivity, added a

        national-Palestinian aspect to its Moslem fundamentalist

        ideology. &quot;Jihad&quot; activists, who advocated

        attacks against Israel and who carried them out as well,

        won great sympathy in the territories, and especially in

        Gaza. On the eve of the intifada, the Islamic Jihad

        enjoyed even greater popularity following a number of

        &quot;successful&quot; attacks carried out by its

        operatives in Gaza and Jerusalem, and following the

        brazen escape of some of the movement&#146;s senior

        activists from an Israeli jail (May 1987). </p>

        <p>B) The many demonstrations and protest activities that

        took place during the first stage of the intifada swept

        the Palestinian masses, including Moslem Brotherhood

        activists, into the streets. The movement&#146;s leaders

        began to fear that continuing to prohibit the

        participation of their members in overt anti-Israel

        activity, would rob them of the widespread support they

        had won, during their supporters into the arms of other

        organizations. </p>

        <p>C) The leadership of the Moslem Brotherhood soon

        understood that the &quot;Palestinian struggle&quot; had

        entered a new phase as a result of the intifada, and that

        whoever succeeded in controlling events in the

        territories would stand a better chance in the

        inter-organizational struggle. </p>

        <p>D) The Moslem Brotherhood leadership estimated that

        after many years of semi-covert recruitment and

        education, their movement had succeeded in winning

        sufficient popular support to make it difficult for

        Israeli forces to eradicate it, even if it were to allow

        its members to participate in anti-Israeli activities. </p>

        <p><a name="Hamas Turns to Violence"><font size="4">Hamas

        Turns to Violence</font></a> </p>

        <p>As a result, in early 1988 Hamas began operating as

        the military arm of the Moslem Brotherhood in the

        territories. Hamas activities were directed against both

        Israelis, military and civilian, and local Palestinians -

        &quot;collaborators&quot; or those &quot;acting contrary

        to Islamic values.&quot; Initially, the movement&#146;s

        operations were concentrated mainly in Gaza, but later

        spread to Judea and Samaria as well. Hamas established a

        network for control and direction of protest activities,

        distributed independent leaflets announcing protest and

        strike dates different from those announced by the

        Unified National Command (PLO), organized widespread

        demonstrations and disturbances in the territories, and

        acted against those who &quot;currupt morals&quot; (those

        involved with prostitution, drugs and alchohol). </p>

        <p>A few months after the outbreak of the intifada, Hamas

        was already playing a central role in the various protest

        and terrorist activities in the territories, while

        movement activists began to carry out terrorist attacks

        against Israeli civilian and military targets. </p>

        <p><a name="Hamas Terrorist Activities"><font size="4">Hamas

        Terrorist Activities</font> </a></p>

        <p>Hamas is one of the most extreme organizations in its

        attitude toward Israel. Leaflet #65 (October 1990) called

        upon local residents to murder Jews and burn their

        property. &quot;Every Jew or settler is a target and must

        be killed. Their blood and their property are

        forfeit&quot;. </p>

        <p>In carrying out their religious duty to fight against

        Israel, Hamas adherents have been responsible for such

        attacks as the brutal murder of three workers at an

        aluminium plant in Jaffa in December 1990; the

        infiltration of a six-man terrorist squad from Jordan in

        March 1991 that wounded three IDF soldiers before they

        were caught in the vicinity of Kibbutz Tirat Zvi, and

        whose members carried Korans and photographs of Sheikh

        Yassin in addition to weapons; the murder of Shlomo

        Yehiya from Moshav Kadima in September 1991; and the

        attack at Tel Hashomer junction in October 1991 in which

        two soldiers were killed and eleven others wounded. </p>

        <p>The kidnapping and murder of Israeli soldiers Avi

        Sasportas and Ilan Saadon in 1989, were among the most

        serious carried out by Hamas. The attacks were carried

        out in similar fashion: Mahmoud Nasser (who had been

        released in the Jibril prisoner exchange) and Mahmoud

        Mabhouh, stole an Israeli Subaru automobile, donned

        skullcaps and gave the hitchiking soldiers rides. During

        the drive, the terrorists shot the soldiers with a .22

        caliber pistol and then buried them. </p>

        <p>Following the murders, the two hid out in a house in

        the Daraj section of Gaza where they received assistance

        and food from local Hamas activists. After about a month,

        they were smuggled out to Egypt, from where they were

        taken to Libya. When Israeli security forces were close

        to discovering their hideout, senior Hamas commanders

        recommended that the two commit suicide and become

        matyrs. </p>

        <p>Hamas did not, however, concentrate only upon the

        murder of Israelis, and the movement&#146;s operatives

        were also involved in many murders of Palestinians in the

        territories as well. </p>

        <p><a name="A Synthesis of Religion and Nationalism"><font

        size="4">A Synthesis of Religion and Nationalism</font></a>

        </p>

        <p>The ideology of Hamas is a synthesis of pan-Arab

        Islamic religious ideals and Palestinian nationalism. The

        movement emphasizes that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

        is in reality a religious struggle between Islam and

        Judaism. It is along these lines that Article 15 of the

        Hamas Charter (August 1988) states: &quot;There is no

        escaping [the need] to make it clear to generations of

        Moslems, that the Palestine problem is a religious one,

        and must be treated as such.&quot; This view was

        reinforced in a booklet distributed by Hamas in early

        1990 which stated: &quot;Our struggle with the Jews is a

        struggle between truth and emptiness - between Islam and

        Judaism.&quot; Hamas leaflet #70 (February 1991) called

        upon the PLO to &quot;revoke the Algiers resolutions and

        declare the Islamic [nature] of the Palestinian

        problem.&quot; </p>

        <p>Despite its emphasis upon the Islamic pan-Arab ideal,

        Hamas simultaneously stresses that it is an authentic

        Palestinian movement with the primary goal of solving the

        &quot;Palestinian problem.&quot; In Article 12 of its

        charter, Hamas attempts to reconcile the contradiction

        between its pan-Islamic character and its specifically

        Palestinian national aspirations: &quot;From the point of

        view of the Islamic Resistance Movement, nationalism is a

        part of religious belief. There is no greater nationalism

        than that inherent in a situation in which the enemy

        takes possession of Moslem land. In such a situation,

        every Moslem man and woman is obligated to participate in

        the Jihad.&quot; </p>

        <p><a name="No Territorial Compromise"><font size="4">No

        Territorial Compromise</font> </a></p>

        <p>As a result of its Islamic religious viewpoint, Hamas

        believes that &quot;that the soil of Palestine is

        sacred&quot; and that every Moslem must take action to

        liberate &quot;all of Palestine&quot; from the Jews. The

        objection of Hamas to any territorial compromise with

        Israel, is expressed in Article 1 of its Charter:

        &quot;The Islamic Resistance Movement believes Palestine

        to be the Islamic wakf [sacred property of all Moslems

        until the end of daysýýýý]. Neither Palestine, nor

        any part of it, can be conceded.&quot;; in Article 13:

        &quot;Any concession of a part of Palestine is a

        concession of a part of the faith&quot;; and in Article

        6: [The movement] is striving to fly the flag of Allah

        over every part of Palestine.&quot; </p>

        <p>The movement&#146;s rejection of compromise with

        Israel is also evident in the leaflets which it

        distributes in the territories. In leaflet #34 (January

        1989) Hamas attacked the &quot;traitorous views&quot; of

        Palestinians who support concession of any part of

        Palestine. The leaflet provides the following explanation

        for its rejection of territorial compromise: &quot;How

        can we allow the Jews to establish a state of oppression

        and terrorism on four-fifths of [our] holy land?&quot; In

        leaflet #68 (December 1990), the movement declared it

        would &quot;continue the part of Jihad until all of our

        blessed land is liberated from the river to the

        sea.&quot; </p>

        <p>A slightly more moderate interpretation of Hamas&#146;

        position regarding territorial compromise, appeared in

        the Jordanian daily Sawt A-Shab (18 January 1990).

        According to this article, Hamas could agree to

        territorial concessions to Israel, providing it were

        understood that this compromise would only be temporary,

        and on condition that the compromise would not obligate

        the Palestinians to recognize Israel&#146;s right to

        exist in any part of Palestine. The article states:

        &quot;Hamas believes that liberation of all of Palestine

        from the river to the sea, is the highest possible

        strategic goal. The movement believes, however, that this

        does not preclude liberating parts of Palestine by force

        or any other method, as long as this solution does not

        include recognition of the legality of the Zionist

        presence in Palestine, and as long as this solution does

        not revoke the right of the Palestinian people and of the

        Arab and Islamic nations, to liberate all of the

        Palestinian homeland and destroy the foreign Zionist

        entity.&quot; </p>

        <p><a name="No Negotiations with Israel"><font size="4">No

        Negotiations with Israel</font> </a></p>

        <p>The hard-line stance taken by Hamas regarding

        territorial compromise also accounts for the

        movement&#146;s opposition to any negotiation with Israel

        whatsoever, for fear that a peace process might entail a

        demand for Palestinian concessions as well. The

        movement&#146;s Charter states in Article

        13:&quot;Initiatives and so-called peaceful solutions and

        international conferences for the resolution of the

        Palestinian problem, are contrary to the views of the

        Islamic Resistance Movement... These conferences are

        nothing but another method by which the infidels take

        possession of Moslem land. When did the infidels ever

        deal justly with sons of the faith?... The only solution

        to the Palestinian problem is Jihad. All of the

        initiatives, proposals and international conferences are

        a waste of time.&quot; </p>

        <p>In Article 32 of the Charter, the movement expresses

        its opposition to any bilateral agreement between Israel

        and the Arab states: &quot;World Zionism and the

        imperialist forces are cleverly trying through careful

        planning to remove the Arab states, one by one, from the

        arena in order to isolate the Palestinian people.... The

        Islamic Resistance Movement calls upon Arab and Moslem

        peoples to act seriously and continuously to thwart this

        fearful plan, and to awaken public awareness to the

        danger involved in withdrawal from the field of conflict

        with Zionism.&quot; </p>

        <p>In Hamas leaflets distributed over the past few years

        in the territories, the movement has expressed its

        opposition to every possible peace plan that has arisen.

        In leaflet #46 (September 1989) the movement rejected

        Egypt&#146;s ten-point peace plan and warned Palestinians

        against contact with the United States. In leaflet #55

        (March 1990) the movement attacked Palestinian figures

        who had met with former U.S. President Carter, and

        declared that these were trying to revive Camp David

        accords and that they do not represent the Palestinian

        people. </p>

        <p>Predictably, Hamas also opposes the current peace

        talks between Israel and the Palestinians and other

        Arabs. The talks that began in Madrid and have continued

        in Washington, have aroused the anger of Hamas, whose

        activists have vowed to do everything in their power to

        undercut them and have branded the Palestinian delegates

        as traitors. </p>

        <p><a name="The Imperative of Holy War"><font size="4">The

        Imperative of Holy War</font></a> </p>

        <p>In the absence of any willingness to accept

        territorial compromise, and in the light of the

        movement&#146;s adamant refusal to conduct negotiations

        with Israel, the only path left open to Hamas for the

        resolution of the Palestinian problem, is that of violent

        struggle to the death - the way of Jihad. </p>

        <p>Since its founding, Hamas has emphasized the

        imperative upon Moslems everywhere to take part in the

        Jihad for the liberation of Palestine, as expressed in

        Article 14 of the charter: &quot;It (the liberation of

        Palestine) is the personal obligation of all Moslems

        everywhere. The problem must be viewed on this basis, and

        every Moslem must understand this;&quot; and in Article

        15: &quot;The day upon which the enemy steals a part of

        the Moslem lands, Jihad becomes the personal obligation

        of every Moslem. In light of the Jewish theft in

        Palestine, there is no alternative but to raise the flag

        of Jihad.&quot; </p>

        <p>The movement, however, defines Jihad in a broader

        sense. Jihad, according to the charter, &quot;is not

        limited to bearing arms. The struggle against the enemy,

        with an appropriate word, a good article, or a helpful

        book; through support and assistance, when done in the

        name of victory for the flag of Allah - are all Jihad for

        the sake of God.&quot; </p>

        <p>In an interview with Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin

        in Yediot Ahronot (September 1988), there appeared,

        nevertheless, to be a remote chance that the movement

        might agree to negotiations with Israel. Yassin declared:

        &quot;As long as we ourselves have not liberated any part

        of Palestine, there is no point in beginning these

        proceedings. Their time has not yet come. The PLO must

        exercise patience and not recognize Israel, since Israel

        has taken everything from the Palestinian people and

        given nothing in return. Israel must first restore the

        rights of the Palestinian people. Only then will it be

        possible to talk.&quot; </p>

        <p>In an interview with Israel Television&#146;s Arabic

        service (while imprisoned in September 1989), Yassin

        explained that he would agree to peace talks with Israel

        providing that both the terms of the peace plan and the

        final objectives of negotiations were clear. A short time

        later (December 1989), the movement&#146;s

        representatives in the territories demanded that the PLO

        allot five places to Hamas on the delegation then taking

        shape for negotiations with Israel. It should be noted

        that the hierarchical structure of Hamas (the leader of

        the movement is not only its central political figure,

        but also the highest religious authority) grants its

        leadership room to maneuver regarding negotiations with

        Israel. Thus, if at some point, the movement&#146;s

        leaders feel it is in its interest to do so, they might

        find religious sanction for its participation in a peace

        process in the region. </p>

        <p>Hamas is opposed to the idea of autonomy in the

        territories since, according to Sheikh Yassin, &quot;the

        actual meaning of autonomy is that the Jews will have

        everything and the Palestinians nothing.&quot; The final

        goal to which the movement aspires, is the liberation of

        all of Palestine and the establishment of an Islamic

        state from the river to the sea. </p>

        <p>In this regard, Hamas also opposes an independent

        Palestinian state. In an interview in Haaretz, Gaza Hamas

        leader Mahmud Azhar state: &quot;The Palestinians were

        always part of a pan-Islamic state.... In Europe they are

        now establishing an economic union and soon they will

        also establish a political union. This is the direction

        in which the world is going today. We Arabs have one

        culture and one language. The borders of the different

        states in the Arab world are not our borders, but rather

        borders set by France and Britain. The border with Egypt

        is not our border and the border between Iraq and Syria

        is not our border. Nasser wanted to establish a pan-Arab

        state in his way, the secular way, and failed. Now we

        want to try this idea our way&quot;. </p>

        <p>In the ideal Islamic state, according to Hamas, peace

        and tranquility will reign, as stated in Article 6 of the

        charter: &quot;Alongside Islam, adherents to all

        religions will be able to live in peace and safety to

        themselves, their property and their rights.&quot; </p>

        <p>It appears, however, from other articles in the

        charter and the movement&#146;s various publications,

        that the attitude of Hamas toward Jews in general and

        Israelis in particular, is not as humane as the movement

        would have it seem. In leaflet #34 (January 1989) the

        movement called upon residents of the territories to

        &quot;destroy the Jews and take revenge on them&quot;.

        Article 7 of the Charter quotes from the Koran: &quot;The

        hour will not come until the Moslems fight the Jews and

        kill them, so much so that when a Jew will hide behind a

        tree or a stone, these will say: &quot;Moslem, servant of

        God, there is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him.&quot; </p>

        <p>The Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba (October 1988) offered an

        explanation of the movement&#146;s attitude toward the

        Jews: &quot;Allah gathered the Jews to Palestine not so

        that it should serve them as a homeland, but rather so

        that Palestine should serve them as a cemetery. Allah

        will rid the entire world of the Jewish affliction, and

        just as pilgrims atone for their sins by offering a

        sacrifice at Mecca, so the Jews will be offered as a

        sacrifice at Al-Aqsa by hands as pure as those of the

        pilgrims.&quot; </p>

        <p><a name="Structure of the Movement"><font size="4">Structure

        of the Movement</font></a> </p>

        <p>Following the outbreak of the intifada, the leaders of

        the Moslem Brotherhood decided that the time had come to

        found a military arm, which would take part in resistance

        and protest activities in the territories, in terrorist

        attacks against Israel, and in the Palestinian

        inter-organizational struggle for control in the West

        Bank and the Gaza Strip. Some of the central sections of

        Hamas (such as the military and security sections) were,

        therefore, built upon the existing Moslem Brotherhood

        structures established during the 1980s. </p>

        <p>Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, aged 47, and the father of 11, is

        still considered the leader of Hamas. He is confined to a

        wheelchair, the result of a fall on the beach in his

        teens (there are those who claim he was injured in an

        explosion). Despite his disability, he studied at Ein

        Shams University in Cairo and returned to Gaza as a

        teacher. In November 1989, Yassin was charged with having

        devised the goals of the organizations he had founded,

        directing their activities, passing on extensive

        financial assistance to them, receiving reports on their

        activities, ordering the murder of three collaborators

        and planning further murders. In October 1991, he was

        convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment plus 15

        years. </p>

        <p>Following the arrest of Sheikh Yassin, Dr. Ibrahim

        Yazouri was appointed Head of the Moslem Brotherhood.

        Arrested in 1990, Yazouri was found guilty of serious

        security offenses and of having been responsible for the

        deaths of the two Israeli soldiers. </p>

        <p>In its founding stage during the early months of the

        intifada (1987-1988), the movement concentrated upon

        building its sections and activating its members. The

        institutionalizing stage came in 1989, during which the

        movement worked on strengthening its infrastructure while

        establishing low-level ranks of command on the regional

        level. The reorganizing stage began following the first

        wave of arrests of the senior and mid-level leadership of

        Hamas in late 1989. Israel&#146;s determined action

        against the Islamic Resistance Movement and its leaders,

        was a severe blow to the movement and forced it to

        restaff most of the senior positions in its various

        divisions. The movement was also forced to move its

        leadership to Jordan, to build its control facilities

        there, and to establish its apparatus there along lines

        similar to those in the territories. </p>

        <p>The military section of Hamas (called Mujahedim

        A-Falestinin) was founded in 1982 as an independent body

        affiliated with the Moslem Brotherhood. This section

        concentrates on planning and carrying out attacks against

        Israeli military and civilian targets both in the

        territories and within the &quot;Green Line.&quot; The

        leaders of the military section order operatives to carry

        out terrorist attacks, provide them with material, and

        brief them prior to carrying out operations. The section

        operates under great secrecy, employs various methods of

        hiding and relaying arms and information among the

        movement&#146;s activists, and trains operatives in

        various methods of fighting, often including the use of

        live weapons and the preparation of explosives. Until the

        end of 1989, the military arm was headed by Sheikh /Salah

        Shahadeh, and since his arrest is apparently operated

        from Jordan and perhaps even (through messengers) from

        Israeli jails. </p>

        <p>The Hamas security section, Al-Majd (Glory), was

        founded in 1987 (before the intifada) within the Moslem

        Brotherhood in the territories. The aim of this section,

        as defined by the movement&#146;s leaders at the time,

        was to fight &quot;corruption&quot; in the territories

        and to monitor Palestinians suspected of collaboration

        with Israel. These tasks gained added significance with

        the establishment of Hamas, and operatives of this

        division began to interrogate, judge and carry out

        sentences issued by makeshift courts against Palestinians

        suspected of transgressing against the precepts of Islam

        (such as drug trafficking and sexual misconduct), or of

        collaboration with Israeli security forces. In this

        fashion, operatives of the section brutally tortured and

        murdered dozens of Palestinian &quot;collaborators&quot;

        during the years 1987-1991. </p>

        <p>Another task entrusted to the security section was the

        gathering of information on the activities of other

        Palestinian organizations in the territories, including

        surveillance of their operatives, gathering of leaflets

        distributed by them, and even planting Hamas agents in

        their ranks. Among the material discovered in the Hamas

        archive seized by Israeli security forces in 1989, were

        surveillance reports on activists in other organizations,

        as well as documents instructing Hamas operatives on how

        to infiltrate other organizations and plant agents. </p>

        <p>As opposed to other Palestine organizations in the

        territories, Hamas found no need to operate a special

        section for the dissemination of its ideology among the

        residents of the territories. Hamas, established by the

        Moslem Brotherhood, simply employed the dozens of mosques

        and Islamic associations already existing in the West

        Bank and Gaza to this end. The movement&#146;s

        information section was, therefore, charged with the

        dissemination of its decisions and instructions regarding

        strikes, demonstrations, etc., among the entire

        population of the territories and not specifically among

        Hamas activists. Operatives of the Hamas information

        section are responsible for writing the movement&#146;s

        leaflets and distributing them throughout the

        territories, for which purpose they use a vast network of

        messengers and a modern system of facsimile machines

        (some of which were seized by Israeli security forces in

        1991). </p>

        <p>The information section is also apparently responsible

        for the publication of the movement&#146;s various

        periodicals in Arab countries and Europe (i.e., Falestine

        al-Muslimah,ýý published in the U.K.). The section

        apparently maintains strong ties with pro-Hamas

        newspapers published within the &quot;Green Line&quot; by

        Moslem activists in Israel, as well. </p>

        <p>The &quot;uprising&quot; section of Hamas is

        responsible for organizing and implementing protests and

        demonstrations in the territories. Section members write

        anti-Israel slogans on the walls of buildings, prevent

        Palestinians from going to work in Israel, and initiate

        local clashes with the IDF including stone-throwing and

        roadblocks. This section is also in charge of

        distributing leaflets on the street, organizing strikes

        and enforcing them, and distributing funds to needy

        families. </p>

        <p>At the head of Hamas and subordinate to the

        movement&#146;s leader, Sheikh Yassin, stands the

        Steering Committee, which includes Sheikh Mohammed Abu

        Zid, Sheikh Bassam Jarar, Sheikh Jamal Hamami and others

        and serves as the movement&#146;s senior ideological and

        religious authority. </p>

        <p>Following the arrest of Sheikh Yassin along with a

        number of the members of the Steering Committee, new

        activists were appointed to leadership positions, and the

        involvement of Jordan-based Moslem Brotherhood leaders in

        Hamas activities in the territories increased. </p>

        <p>Lower down in the Hamas hierarchy is the Central

        Committee, in charge of planning and coordination of the

        movement&#146;s operation in the West Bank and Gaza, and

        compromising four members: three from the West Bank and

        East Jerusalem, and one from the Gaza Strip. Hamas

        operations sectors include the Northern Sector (the

        Nablus Sector - coordinating activities in Jenin, Nablus

        and Tulkarem), Jerusalem, Hebron and the Gaza Strip. Part

        of the regional command structure was unearthed by

        Israeli security forces in February 1991 and the regional

        leaders, who had been operating under the guise of press

        offices, were arrested. </p>

        <p>Hamas receives funds from three main sources: a)

        Donations and dues from members and supporters in the

        territories (often the result of coercive campaigns

        rather than of a genuine desire to give); b) Special

        fund-raising campaigns held in large Arab and Moslem

        communities in Arab countries (such as Iran, Saudi Arabia

        and the Gulf states), and Islamic charitable institutions

        in the various Arab countries. </p>

        <p>Hamas exerts great efforts at fund-raising among the

        Moslem communities in the United States. As part of the

        campaign to strengthen ties between Hamas and Moslem

        activists in the U.S., the movement&#146;s Third Congress

        was held in late 1990 in Kansas City, with the

        participation of senior Hamas activists. </p>

        <p>An article critical of Hamas and representing the

        views of Fatah, which appeared in the PLO weekly Falestin

        A-Thawra published in Nicosia, questioned the sources of

        the money reaching Hamas and stressed that the receipt of

        funds by Palestinian organizations not via the PLO, in

        fact, harms the interests of the Palestinian people. </p>

        <p><a name="Relations with Other Organizations"><font

        size="4">Relations with Other Organizations</font> </a></p>

        <p>When Hamas was founded in the late 1980s, many

        Palestinian organizations had already been operating in

        the territories for some time. These organizations

        represent a wide range of national and social views and

        can be divided into four groups: a) Mainstream (headed by

        Fatah-Arafat); b)Leftist (including the Popular Front for

        the Liberation of Palestine, headed by George Habash and

        the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,

        headed by Naif Hawatmeh); c) Pro-Syrian (including the

        Jibril Front, A&#146;Saiqa, and Fatah-Abu Mussa); d)

        Islamic (including the Islamic Jihad and Hamas). </p>

        <p>Hamas&#146; attitude toward the PLO is ambivalent:

        sympathetic (as a relative and a partner in common goals

        and interests), but opposed to the PLO&#146;s secular

        outlook and its methods of operation in the international

        arena. Despite attempts by mainstream groups to bring

        Hamas into the fold, the movement has refused to

        participate in the joint leadership of the intifada

        represented by the Unified National Command. At times,

        Hamas has maintained strong ties with PLO activists in

        the territories - especially on the tactical level. At

        others, the political and ideological differences have

        caused tension which has even led to street battles

        between activists of the two organizations. </p>

        <p>In the mid-1980s, as the religious revival in the

        territories began to gather momentum, the rise in the

        popularity of the Moslem Brotherhood became a matter of

        concern among the PLO leadership, and the

        inter-organizational competition could be feld in the

        struggle for control of the universities and Palestinian

        public opinion. This competition was often accompanied by

        violent clashes between the rivals (using stones, clubs

        and axes), in some cases leading to killings. </p>

        <p>By 1988, Hamas was enjoying incredible success,

        evident from the many Palestinians joining its ranks and

        the response to its leaflets calling strikes and

        demonstrations on days other than those called for by the

        PLO. </p>

        <p>During May and June 1991, as the U.S. worked to bring

        the Palestinians into a peace process, the rivalry

        between the two organizations was marked by violence -

        using live weapons at times - mainly in Nablus. Such

        conflicts were renewed at the end of 1991 and the

        beginning of 1992 against the background of the decision

        by the PLO mainstream to participate in the peace talks

        with Israel in Madrid and Washington. </p>

        <p>The year 1991, saw a number of setbacks in the

        standing of Hamas in the territories, which affected its

        relations with the mainstream in Fatah. At the outbreak

        of the Gulf War, support for Hamas in the territories had

        reached its peak. &quot;The mother of all wars&quot;

        stimulated deep religious feelings among the Palestinians

        and wall slogans in support of Saddam Hussein and Hamas

        appeared on houses throughout the territories. The defeat

        of Iraq also affected the Palestinians own sense of

        security and their belief in the ability of the Islamic

        organizations to solve the Palestinian problem and to

        destroy Israel by force, which resulted in a decline in

        the standing of Hamas in the territories. Yet the rise of

        the independent Islamic Republics out of the former USSR

        at the end of 1991, as well as the success of the Moslem

        Brotherhood in Algeria, coupled with frustration at the

        lack of success of the mainstrean PLO in the peace talks

        with Israel, have all worked to improve the prospects of

        Hamas in the territories. </p>

        <p>The leftist organizations - the Habash Front, the

        Palestinian Communist Party, and Naif Hawatmeh&#146;s

        Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (which

        during the intifada joined the mainstream group and

        participated in the Unified National Command) - are

        considered totally abhorrent by Hamas. In September 1988,

        Sheikh Yassin stated with regard to the communists:

        &quot;No, I do not see any possibility of cooperation

        with them. They are heretics.&quot; </p>

        <p>The pro-Syrian groups, like most of the terrorist

        organizations, are secular in their outlook and, moreover

        (as opposed to Fatah-Arafat), also serve as Syrian

        puppets in the Palestinian arena. On the other hand,

        however, after Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin had been

        sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for possession of

        large quantities of arms and for heading a hostile

        organization in the mid-1980s, he was released through

        the intervention of Ahmed Jibril&#146;s pro-Syrian

        organization, which demanded Yassin&#146;s release as

        part of its prisoner exchange with Israel. </p>

        <p>The Islamic Jihad - Hamas&#146; rival in the Islamic

        camp in the territories - was, in fact, the catalyst for

        the establishment of the Hamas movement. It was the

        achievements of the activist Islamic Jihad and the

        popularity it enjoyed among Palestinians during the

        period prior to the outbreak of the intifada and during

        its first few months that, inter alia, brought the

        leaders of the Moslem Brotherhood to the realization that

        they must take an active part in the Palestinian struggle

        in the territories. </p>

        <p>Since the Islamic Jihad and Hamas both derive their

        support from the same group - the religious

        fundamentalists in the territories - the rivalry between

        the two movements is great. Stategically, the two

        organizations strive for the same goals: the liberation

        of Palestine through uncompromising armed struggle, and

        the establishment of an Islamic religious regime in the

        liberated territory. However, while the Islamic Jihad

        strives for an Iranian-style Islamic revolution in

        Palestine with Iranian support, Hamas is critical of the

        Islamic Jihad&#146;s ties with Iran. </p>

        <p>Hamas also collaborates with Islamic fundamentalists

        in Israel. The leader of the Islamic movement in Israel,

        Sheikh Abdullah Nimr Darwish, in December 1989 called

        Hamas &quot;an integral part of the Palestinian people,

        struggling for an independent state.&quot; Most of this

        co-operation, however, is limited to dissemination of the

        movement&#146;s ideology through newspapers printed and

        circulated in Israel (such as Sawt ak-Haq

        W&#146;al-Hourriah - The Voice of Justice and Freedom -

        published in Umm El-Fahm, and closed in 1990 by the

        Interior Minister for three months for anti-Israel

        agitation), and technical assistance in printing the

        movement&#146;s leaflets in Israel. </p>

        <p>Hamas continues to increase in strength in the

        Israeli-administered territories and more and more is

        coming to threaten the exclusive position of the PLO. The

        future growth of the movement may depend in a large part

        on the outcome of the current peace talks. Lack of

        progress in the talks as perceived by the Palestinians,

        may well work to the advantage of the Islamic

        fundamentalists. </p>
