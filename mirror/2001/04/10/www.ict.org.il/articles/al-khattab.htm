<p><img src="../graphics/dagestan_w.gif" width=188 height=169 border="0" alt="Dagestan" align="right">The Radical Islamic struggle against Russia in Chechnya and Daghestan,
and the terrorist bombings in Moscow in the last weeks, have brought
to light a new Islamic leader, a man known in Russia and the West
as Al-Khattab. He is considered to be one of two guerrilla leaders involved
in the present Islamist struggle, the other being the Chechen warlord,
Shamil Basayev.
<p>To date not much is known about Khattab, and it would seem that he relishes
this air of mystery about him. Even the name “Khattab” is probably a nickname.
According to several Central-Asia sources his real name is Habib Abd al-Rahman.
So far very few photos of him have been published. He is described as being
round of face, with a wide flowing black beard, long frizzy hair often
worn under a beret, and an ugly scar on his left forearm. Said to be currently
34 years of age, Khattab was born to a Saudi tribe residing in the border
area between Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Jordan. Thus he is sometimes
referred to as of Saudi origin and sometimes as a Jordanian citizen. That
he once had plans to study in the United States implies that he comes from
a wealthy family. He currently makes his home in Chechnya, where he is
married to two Chechen women.
<p>At the age of 19 Khattab was sent by his family to study in the USA,
but it is unknown whether he ever arrived there. Fifteen years ago he appeared
among the Arab volunteers in Afghanistan, and it seems that he moved there
directly from his residence without beginning a course of study in the
U.S.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Road to Dagestan</b><b></b>
<p>In 1992 Khattab moved from Afghanistan to Tajikistan to fight with the
Islamic opposition against the Communist-backed regime. In 1995 he moved
to Chechnya, probably with a group of loyalists of Arab origin, and began
training Chechen Islamists. He soon became famous for his bravery and for
his repeated successes against Russian armored convoys. This success brought
him closer to Shamil Basayev, then one of the Chechen rebel leaders. Basayev
is now in partnership with Khattab, whose current title is Commander of
the “Islamic Army of Dagestan” in the struggle for an Islamist Chechnya.
Russian officials claimed in the media that Khattab is accompanied on every
operation by two cameramen to record the engagement.
<p>Khattab runs a training camp at Serzhen-Yurt in Chechnya, which allegedly
trains not only Islamists from Chechnya and Dagestan, but from other countries
as well. Just as in Afghanistan during the 1980s, Khattab and Basayev are
but two of the leaders of various groups—some of which are in permanent
rivalry with one another. Beside the personal disputes and the nature of
the militants themselves, there are also religious and ideological disputes.
It is believed that Khattab has already escaped three assassination attempts,
the most recent in 1998.
<p>On August 7<sup>th</sup>, Khattab led about 2,000 militants into Dagestan
from his base in Chechnya. There he seized control of a number of villages
and declared an Islamic republic. The rebels were forced back into Chechnya
by Russian troops, only to return to Dagestan on September 5<sup>th</sup>.
Khattab’s retreat and return coincided with the wave of terrorist explosions
in Moscow.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Khattab and bin Ladin—partners or rivals?</b>
<p>Khattab is regarded as one of the main proponents of the Wahhabi movement,
which in Central-Asia has championed one of the most extreme interpretations
of Islamic Jihad, an interpretation developed in Afghanistan by the late
Palestinian militant Dr. Abdallah Azzam. Azzam was the spiritual guide
of Osama bin Ladin. However, Khattab—unlike some of the Arab Islamists
who have led such groups in the past—is neither a religious figure nor
a writer of ideology or religio-political commentary.
<p>The Russian media in the days following the Moscow explosions, has made
frequent mention of the connection between Khattab and Osama bin Ladin,
who is said to have provided both financial aid and manpower to the Islamic
rebels in Chechnya and in Afghanistan. Russian officials also claim that
financial aid is flowing to the rebels from many sources in Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, and radical organizations in Pakistan, Turkey and Afghanistan.
Some officials have accused Georgia and Azerbaijan of supplying weapons
to the Islamic rebels.
<p>There are a number of mysteries surrounding Khattab, not the least of
which is his relationship with the other Chechen rebels and with Osama
bin Ladin. The source of his finances is obscure. There is also undoubtedly
a good deal of disinformation concerning him.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A Russian connection?</b>
<p>One of the most interesting puzzles is his relationship with Russian
officials. According to the Russian newspaper <i>Izvestiya</i> (June 15<sup>th</sup>
1999), men from Khattab’s force were seen in Moscow two months before the
bombings. They purportedly came to Moscow to buy uniforms and carried a
license for such purchases from the Interior ministry, the Federal Security
Service and the Emergency Ministry. This and other similar transactions
with the Interior Ministry raise the question of whether Khattab has some
official patronage in Moscow.
<p>It is no secret that there is a dispute in the Russian government between
several factions as to the reaction to the Islamic struggle in Central-Asia.
Each of these factions has its own media, the control of which it shares
with rival tycoons and businessmen, and this too is a veritable hothouse
for disinformation. In addition, there are Russian businessmen with financial
interests in Chechnya, and there is always the possibility that part of
this money is used to finance terrorism as well. According to the London-based
Arabic language newspaper <i>Al-Hayat</i> (September 17<sup>th)</sup>,
the Russian television network NTV, owned by Vladimir Gussinsky, published
a recording of a phone talk between Gussinsky’s greatest rival, businessman
Boris Birrizowsky, and “one of the Chechen extremists.” The later urged
Birrizowsky to send $2.5 million to support the “terrorist groups.” Birrizowsky
in his turn denied the report and blamed his rival for “collaborating with
the rebels.”
<p>Some of the Russian media have tried hard to connect Khattab directly
with the Moscow explosions, like the Weekly <i>Novaya Gazeta</i>, which
wrote a week ago that “Khattab has sworn on the Qor`an to pay each participant
in the bombing campaign up to $50,000.” In an interview with NTV, Vyacheslav
Izmailov, the author of the <i>Gazeta</i> article claimed that Khattab
had recruited ethnic Slavs—including former Russian military personnel—for
the terrorist campaign, and had divided them into groups sent to Moscow,
St. Petersburg and Rostov.
<p>On the other hand, the Russian Interior Minister claimed in a phone
conversation with Lewis Frye the head of the FBI on September 9<sup>th</sup>
that it was Osama bin Ladin who was responsible for the bombings in Moscow.
Yet it seems likely that this was merely an excuse to motivate the Americans
to engage in more extensive information gathering in the case, since it
is known that the Americans are seeking bin Ladin’s shadow and fingerprints
everywhere in the world.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Threats and denials</b>
<p>In an interview with Greg Myre of the Associated Press published on
September 14<sup>th</sup>, Khattab stated that “From now on they will get
our bombs everywhere. Let Russia await our explosions blasting through
their cities. I swear we will do it.” That interview was held between 9-13
September. On September 14<sup>th</sup>, Khattab told the Interfax news
agency in Grozny that he had nothing to do with the Moscow explosions.
He was quoted as saying, “We would not like to be akin to those who kill
sleeping civilians with bombs and shells.”
<p>It should be noticed that so far Khattab, like his partner Shamil Basayev,
have spoken only of the struggle against Russia and their goal of reconstructing
the Islamic state of 19<sup>th</sup> century Dagestan on a Wahhabi foundation.
Until now they do have never used the language of bin Ladin or other Arab
Islamists who talk about a global Islamic struggle against the West, the
U.S. or the Jews. This, by the way, may mean that so far they have no real
ties or obligations to bin Ladin and his Front, and are financby Wahhabi
sources in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. It should also be noted that
Khattab’s name did not appear in the intensive investigation of bin Ladin’s
network and organization following the bombing of the American embassies
in Africa in August 1998. Bin Ladin was indeed quoted several times in
recent months as supporting the Chechen struggle, and is even claimed to
have twice visited Chechnya during 1999. However, there is as yet no real
information as to whether his support of the Chechen or their Islamist
allies is more than verbal or ideological.
<p>Khattab also did not appear until recently in the Arab media, including
the Islamist media that had reported on Central-Asia and the Islamic struggle
there. It would seem that until now he really had no connections with the
Arab radical Islamist struggles, not even on the Saudi or Jordanian scene.
Whether this will remain true following his recent notoriety is anyone’s
guess.
