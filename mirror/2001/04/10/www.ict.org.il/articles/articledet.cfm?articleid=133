<p><p>Hizballah’s capture of three IDF soldiers in the disputed Lebanese-Israeli
eastern Har Dov/Shebaa Farms border area Saturday marked the most serious
outbreak of IDF-Hizballah hostilities since the Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon in May. The well-planned and executed ambush underscored
the continued threat to Israel posed by Hizballah’s highly-skilled guerrilla
force, despite UN peacekeepers and Lebanese security forces now deployed
in the south. While Hizballah’s rhetoric about support for the Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza has been heated and virulent, the capture
of the three soldiers has much more to do with Hizballah’s and Syria’s
agenda in Lebanon than with wanting to open a second front against Israel
in support of the Palestinians.
<p><b>Ambush Planned Months Ago</b>
<p>While the timing of the ambush provided Hizballah with the opportunity
to show moral support for the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza, it had, in fact, been planned months ago. Hizballah operatives as
far back as June reportedly conducted limited infiltrations into Israel
to gather intelligence on IDF capabilities along the border, mostly in
preparation for a kidnapping. Deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh warned
in late June that a kidnapping would be used as a bargaining chip for Hizballah
to try to win the release of Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails. More
recent information indicated that the kidnapping would be attempted in
the disputed Har Dov/Shebaa area (for more background information on the
disputed territory, see PeaceWatch #256 of 25 April 2000, “The Israel-Lebanon
Border: A Primer.”) That area is a choice spot for such an operation due
to mountainous terrain favorable to guerrilla tactics, and claims by the
Lebanese government that the area is occupied illegally by the Israelis.
The kidnapping operation was carefully planned and executed, including
the use of a diversionary rocket and mortar attack on IDF positions, although
several blunders by the 3-man IDF crew that was kidnapped certainly aided
the Hizballah operatives. The kidnapping demonstrated the continued threat
Israel faces from Hizballah, whose guerrillas have no intention of disbanding
and face no pressure to do so absent an Israeli peace deal with Damascus
and Beirut.
<p><b>Pressures to Open a Second Front</b>
<p>The timing of the ambush may demonstrate Hizballah’s intent to open
a “second front” against Israel in support of the Palestinian uprising
in the West Bank and Gaza. This is further suggested by Hizballah statements
strongly supporting and encouraging the “blessed intifada” by the Palestinians,
and Hizballah’s dedication of its kidnapping operation to a Palestinian
boy killed during last week’s fighting. Another indicator is Hizballah
secretary-general Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah reportedly giving serious consideration
to adding Palestinian prisoners to his demand for the release of Lebanese
prisoners in exchange for the three IDF soldiers captured on Saturday.
Doing so would further boost Hizballah’s stature in the Arab World. Meanwhile,
Fatah officials reportedly are in contact with Hizballah in an effort to
enlist the group’s direct support for the uprising.
<p>Iran constitutes a likely source of pressure on Hizballah to directly
support the Palestinian uprising. Tehran reportedly has orchestrated recent
meetings between Hizballah and several Palestinian terrorist groups, which
could be related to terrorist planning. In addition to meetings with Syrian
officials in Damascus and Lebanese leaders in Beirut yesterday, Iranian
foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi held discussions with Hizballah officials;
the latter likely dealt with Iranian efforts to facilitate Hizballah support
for the Palestinian uprising.
<p><b>Countervailing Pressures</b>
<p>Whatever pressures exist towards opening a second front, Hizballah faces
countervailing pressures and disincentives. First, more cross-border attacks,
particularly along other areas of the border that are clearly delineated,
could turn south Lebanon back into a battleground, and in the process undermine
the “victory” which Hizballah has declared and celebrated since the IDF
withdrawal. Second, provoking a major clash with Israel would result in
a backlash by Hizballah’s most important constituency-the Shias of southern
Lebanon, who are eager to attract foreign investment and aid to rebuild
the South. Third, provoking a major clash would damage Hizballah’s relations
with non-Shia Lebanese as well. Lebanese Christians-including a Lebanese
parliament-member elect, Alber Mukhaiber-have criticized the Hizballah
kidnapping operation as an unnecessary provocation that could lead to a
renewed cycle of violence.
<p>In addition to domestic concerns, Hizballah will have to take into account
the attitudes of both Damascus and Beirut to the idea of opening a second
front. If Bashar al-Asad believes Israeli threats to hold Syria responsible
for Hizballah actions in Lebanon, he has to worry about the prospect of
major Israeli reprisal attacks against Syrian assets in Lebanon or in Syria
itself. That development would pose a major challenge to Bashar, pressuring
him either into escalation and thereby risking a major military defeat,
or backing down and thereby risking a domestic backlash, particularly while
the Palestinian uprising continues. It seems most likely that Syria prefers
to leave the border situation sufficiently unstable as to pressure Israel
into a deal on Syrian terms, but not to the point where Israel is provoked
into large-scale military action. Meanwhile, Beirut is eager to rebuild
its decimated economy and attract foreign investment and aid, none of which
would be served by renewed armed conflict with the IDF.
<p><b>Outlook</b>
<p>On balance, evidence suggests Nasrallah sees Hizballah’s interests not
served by opening a second front with Israel. The best evidence of this
is that Hizballah has not conducted any raids since Saturday’s operation,
and on Sunday turned away a group of Palestinians attempting to instigate
violence at the Fatma gate. Moreover, Nasrallah in the past has made clear
that the responsibility for “liberating Jerusalem” and the rest of “Palestine”
is the responsibility of the Palestinians and not Hizballah.
<p>Nasrallah, however, may agree to provide covert arms and training to
Palestinian militants, perhaps to assuage the Iranians and to extend at
least token support of the Palestinian uprising. However, given Hizballah’s
reluctance to see armed Palestinians taking the initiative in Lebanon,
its aid is likely to be directed to Palestinian terrorist groups-particularly
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad-operating in the West Bank and Gaza.
<p>Probably the greatest threat to quiet along the Israeli-Lebanese border
is not Hizballah provocations, but Palestinian violence perpetrated from
the Lebanese side, as demonstrated during Saturday’s clash that resulted
in two Palestinians killed. As a UNIFIL spokesman recently noted, “all
it takes is one man with a Kalashnikov or a rocket-propelled grenade--then
we have a disaster on our hands.” Short of the Lebanese government securing
the border, which Syria is highly unlikely to authorize absent a peace
deal with Israel, the security situation at the border will remain volatile.
