    as well as to any group of people acting to achieve aims of that nature,
    which the  above-mentioned groups have been working to achieve,  through
    means similar to those which the above-mentioned groups have used,  even

    or groups attached to the above-mentioned organizations."<p>

    C. The Government of Israel made the following decisions:<p>

         1. The Government  of Israel  reaffirms that at present,  as in the
    past,  it is  solely responsible,  by means of the Israel Defense Forces
    and the Israel Police, for the security of all inhabitants,  both Jewish
    and Arab, of the territories of Judea, Samaria and Gaza.  The Government
    of Israel  intends to  continue taking  all measures necessary to ensure
    security, within the boundaries of the law.  It reaffirms its commitment
    to promote  maximum security to all residents,  and to act with its full

         5. The Government  calls upon  all residents  to show vigilance and
    act  responsibly,   in  order  to  help  establish  peace  and  security
    throughout the country.<P>
