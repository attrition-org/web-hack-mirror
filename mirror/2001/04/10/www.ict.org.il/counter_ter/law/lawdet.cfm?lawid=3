<p><p>

                         UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION <p>
<p>

The High  Court of  Justice decision  is substantiated and detailed,  and
extends over 32 pages. The following is the summation clause: <p>

"17. In summation, we have unanimously reached the following conclusions:<p>

A:  Concerning the  individual expulsion  orders,  we determine  that the
failure to  satisfy the  right to  a prior  hearing does not affect their
validity.  We instruct  that the  right to  a hearing  now be  given,  as
detailed above.<p>

B:  The  order  regarding  the  Temporary Expulsion  (Emergency) Order is
invalid due  to the reason brought forth in sections 12 (d) and 13 above.
This conclusion  does not affect the validity of the individual expulsion
orders.<p>

C:  As stated,  charges  against the validity of the individual expulsion
orders  which  were  issued  pursuant  to  regulation 112 of  the Defense<p>
(Emergency) Regulations  1945, should   be  raised  before  the  advisory
commission.<p>

In accordance  with the  above,  we dismiss  the petitions and cancel the
order nisi."
<p>

Also of  note are sections 14 and 15 of the High Court of Justice ruling,
which mention the procedures by which the appeals can be heard:<p>

"14. The petitioners  charged that  the individual  expulsion orders  are
invalid owing to defects in process,  beyond the negation of the right to
petition. The respondents disputed this.<p>

We believe that, in the case before us,  the place of the charges such as
these  is  before  the  advisory  commission  to  which  the deportee  is
permitted to  direct his  appeal.  As long as the advisory commission has
not decided otherwise, each individual order remains valid.<p>

15. The  respondents   must  now  make  practical  arrangements  for  the
realization  of  the  right  to  appear  before  an  advisory  commission
operating in  accordance with regulation 122 (8) of the above regulations
vis-a-vis all  who wish  to do  so.  Accordingly,  if a written appeal is
received from  a deportee  via the International Red Cross or any other
means  by  which the commission is requested to hear his appeal,  it is
proper that  the petitioner  be permitted to appear personally before the
commission  in  order that  the commission  may take  note of  his verbal
explanations,  and that  it may examine the matter and the justice of the
expulsion order executed in his case.  Prior to the appearance before the
commission, he should also be allowed a personal meeting with an attorney
who wishes to represent the deportee before the commission.<p>

The commission  can conduct its hearings anywhere that the IDF can ensure
that the hearings are held properly.<p>

To  implement  all  the  above,   the  respondents  must  make  practical
arrangements,  the  details  of  which  should  be  decided  upon  by the
authorities responsible  for them.  The beginning of the arrangements has
been described  in the  State deposition  submitted to us on 25.1.92, but
these must  be supplemented  in accordance  with the  spirit of our words
herein.<p>

Furthermore,  we have taken note of the statement of the Legal Advisor to
the  Government  on 25.1.93, according  to which  there will  be held  
within  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  and  at  the  initiative  of the
respondents  a further analysis of the security information relating to
each deportee who does not submit an appeal."
