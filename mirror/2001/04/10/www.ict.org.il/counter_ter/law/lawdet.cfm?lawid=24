<P><i>Defining the approach and Administrative Structure for Government's Comprehensive Peace Efforts</i>


<p><p>WHEREAS, a primary objective of Government is the attainment of a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace under the Rule of Law and in accordance
with Constitutional processes, which is the basic foundation for economic
development and national prosperity.
<p>WHEREAS, the National Unification Committee, by virtue of its mandate
under Executive Order No. 19, has submitted recommendations to the President
for the pursuit of a peace process envisioned to lead to a just, comprehensive
and lasting peace in the country.
<p>WHEREAS, the term of the National Unification Commission ended on 31
July 1993; and
<p>WHEREAS, a comprehensive peace process demands a wholistic approach
that will require the cooperative efforts of all sectors of society.
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FIDEL V. RAMOS, President of the Republic of the
Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by law, do hereby order:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Section 1. Scope.</b>
<p>The systematic approach for the pursuit of peace, as well as the administrative
structure for carrying out the peace process, shall be governed by this
Executive Order.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Section 2. Principles Underlying the Comprehensive Peace Process.</b>
<p>The comprehensive peace process shall be governed by the following underlying
principles:
<p>A comprehensive peace process should community-based, reflecting the
sentiments, values and principles important to all Filipinos. Thus, it
shall be defined not by Government alone, nor by the different contending
groups only, but by all Filipinos as one community.
<p>A comprehensive peace process aims to forge a new social compact for
a just, equitable, humane and pluralistic society. It seeks to establish
a genuinely pluralistic political society, where all individuals and groups
are free to engage in peaceful competition for predominance of their political
programs without fear, through the exercise of rights and liberties guaranteed
by the Constitution, and where they may compete for political power through
an electoral system that is free, fair and honest.
<p>A comprehensive peace process seeks a principled and peaceful resolution
of the internal armed conflicts, with neither blame nor surrender, but
with dignity for all concerned.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Section 3. Components of the Comprehensive Peace Process.</b>
<p>The comprehensive peace process shall henceforth include, but shall
not be limited to, the following components:
<p>PURSUIT OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORMS. This component shall
involve the vigorous implementation of various policies, reforms, programs
and projects aimed at addressing the root of causes of internal armed conflicts
and social unrest. This may require administrative action, new legislation,
or even constitutional amendments.
<p>CONSENSUS-BUILDING AND EMPOWERMENT FOR PEACE. This component shall include
continuing consultations on both national and local levels to build consensus
for a peace agenda and process, and the mobilization and facilitation of
people's participation in the peace process.
<p>PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT WITH THE DIFFERENT REBEL GROUPS. This
component involves the conduct of face-to-face negotiations to reach peaceful
settlement with the different rebel groups.
<p>PROGRAMS FOR RECONCILIATION, REINTEGRATION INTO MAINSTREAM SOCIETY,
AND REHABILITATION. This component shall include programs to address the
legal status and security of former rebels, as well as community-based
assistance programs to address the economic, social and psychological rehabilitation
needs of former rebels, demobilized combatants, and civilian victims of
the internal armed conflicts.
<p>ADDRESSING CONCERNS ARISING FROM THE CONTINUING ARMED HOSTILITIES. This
component involves the strict implementation of laws and policy guidelines,
and the institution of programs to ensure the protection of non-combatants
and reduce the impact of the armed conflict on communities found in conflict
areas.
<p>BUILDING AND NURTURING A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO PEACE. This component
shall include peace advocacy and peace education programs, and the implementation
of various confidence-building measures.
