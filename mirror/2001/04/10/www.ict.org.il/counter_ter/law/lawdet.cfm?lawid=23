conflict under the principle of peace with honor and to serve the paramount
ends of national unity, solidarity and progress for all Filipinos;

lasting, honorable and comprehensive solution to the problem in Southern

the good offices of the Great Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah, inspired and guided
by its great leader, H.E. Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the Government of the
Republic of Indonesia under the wise and able leadership of H.E. Bapah
President Suharto, and H.E. OIC Secretary General, Dr. Hamid Algabid, to
hold formal peace talks to discuss the modalities for the full implementation
of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement in letter and spirit; to include those portions
of the Agreement left for further discussion and the transitional implementing
