<p><p><b><font size=+1>DECLARATION OF SUPPORT</font></b>
<dir>
<dir>1. We, the participants in the multi-party negotiations, believe that
the agreement we have negotiated offers a truly historic opportunity for
a new beginning.
<p>2. The tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable
legacy of suffering. We must never forget those who have died or been injured,
and their families. But we can best honour them through a fresh start,
in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation,
tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and vindication of the
human rights of all.
<p>3. We are committed to partnership, equality and mutual respect as the
basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South,
and between these islands.
<p>4. We reaffirm our total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic
and peaceful means of resolving differences on political issues, and our
opposition to any use or threat of force by others for any political purpose,
whether in regard to this agreement or otherwise.
<p>5. We acknowledge the substantial differences between our continuing,
and equally legitimate, political aspirations. However, we will endeavour
to strive in every practical way towards reconciliation and rapprochement
within the framework of democratic and agreed arrangements. We pledge that
we will, in good faith, work to ensure the success of each and every one
of the arrangements to be established under this agreement. It is accepted
that all of the institutional and constitutional arrangements - an Assembly
in Northern Ireland, a North/South Ministerial Council, implementation
bodies, a British-Irish Council and a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference
and any amendments to British Acts of Parliament and the Constitution of
Ireland - are interlocking and interdependent and that in particular the
functioning of the Assembly and the North/South Council are so closely
inter-related that the success of each depends on that of the other.
<p>6. Accordingly, in a spirit of concord, we strongly commend this agreement
to the people, North and South, for their approval.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
<b><font size=+1>CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1></font></b>&nbsp;
<dir>1. The participants endorse the commitment made by the British and
Irish Governments that, in a new British-Irish Agreement replacing the
Anglo-Irish Agreement, they will:
<p>(i) recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised
by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status,
whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Great Britain
or a sovereign united Ireland;
<p>(ii) recognise that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone,
by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment,
to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent,
freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united
Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved
and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority
of the people of Northern Ireland;
<p>(iii) acknowledge that while a substantial section of the people in
Northern Ireland share the legitimate wish of a majority of the people
of the island of Ireland for a united Ireland, the present wish of a majority
of the people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is
to maintain the Union and, accordingly, that Northern Ireland’s status
as part of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish; and that
it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland
save with the consent of a majority of its people;
<p>(iv) affirm that if, in the future, the people of the island of Ireland
exercise their right of self-determination on the basis set out in sections
(i) and (ii) above to bring about a united Ireland, it will be a binding
obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective
Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish;
<p>(v) affirm that whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of
the people of Northern Ireland, the power of the sovereign government with
jurisdiction there shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf
of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and
shall be founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of,
civil, political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination
for all citizens, and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment
for the identity, ethos, and aspirations of both communities;
<p>(vi) recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland
to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as
they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both
British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would
not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.
<p>2. The participants also note that the two Governments have accordingly
undertaken in the context of this comprehensive political agreement, to
propose and support changes in, respectively, the Constitution of Ireland
and in British legislation relating to the constitutional status of Northern
Ireland.</dir>

</dir>
<b>STRAND ONE</b>
<p><b>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND</b>
<p>1. This agreement provides for a democratically elected Assembly in
Northern Ireland which is inclusive in its membership, capable of exercising
executive and legislative authority, and subject to safeguards to protect
the rights and interests of all sides of the community.
<p><b>The Assembly</b>
<p>2. A 108-member Assembly will be elected by PR(STV) from existing Westminster
constituencies.
<p>3. The Assembly will exercise full legislative and executive authority
in respect of those matters currently within the responsibility of the
six Northern Ireland Government Departments, with the possibility of taking
on responsibility for other matters as detailed elsewhere in this agreement.
<p>4. The Assembly - operating where appropriate on a cross-community basis
- will be the prime source of authority in respect of all devolved responsibilities.
<p><b>Safeguards</b>
<p>5. There will be safeguards to ensure that all sections of the community
can participate and work together successfully in the operation of these
institutions and that all sections of the community are protected, including:
<dir>
<dir>(a) allocations of Committee Chairs, Ministers and Committee membership
in proportion to party strengths;
<p>(b) the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and any Bill of Rights
for Northern Ireland supplementing it, which neither the Assembly nor public
bodies can infringe, together with a Human Rights Commission;
<p>(c) arrangements to provide that key decisions and legislation are proofed
to ensure that they do not infringe the ECHR and any Bill of Rights for
Northern Ireland;
<dir>
<dir>(d) arrangements to ensure key decisions are taken on a cross-community
basis;
<dir>
<dir>(i) <u>either</u> parallel consent, i.e. a majority of those members
present and voting, including a majority of the unionist and nationalist
designations present and voting;
<p>(ii) <u>or</u> a weighted majority (60%) of members present and voting,
including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations
present and voting.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
Key decisions requiring cross-community support will be designated in advance,
including election of the Chair of the Assembly, the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister, standing orders and budget allocations. In other
cases such decisions could be triggered by a petition of concern brought
by a significant minority of Assembly members (30/108).

equality of opportunity in specified areas and parity of esteem between
the two main communities, and to investigate individual complaints against
public bodies.</dir>
</dir><b>Operation of the Assembly</b>
<p>6. At their first meeting, members of the Assembly will register a designation
of identity - nationalist, unionist or other - for the purposes of measuring
cross-community support in Assembly votes under the relevant provisions
above.
<p>7. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Assembly will be elected on a cross-community
basis, as set out in paragraph 5(d) above.
<p>8. There will be a Committee for each of the main executive functions
of the Northern Ireland Administration. The Chairs and Deputy Chairs of
the Assembly Committees will be allocated proportionally, using the d’Hondt
system. Membership of the Committees will be in broad proportion to party
strengths in the Assembly to ensure that the opportunity of Committee places
is available to all members.
<p>9. The Committees will have a scrutiny, policy development and consultation
role with respect to the Department with which each is associated, and
will have a role in initiation of legislation. They will have the power
to:

consider and advise on Departmental budgets and Annual Plans in the context
of the overall budget allocation;</li>

<li>
approve relevant secondary legislation and take the Committee stage of
relevant primary legislation;</li>

<li>
call for persons and papers;</li>

<li>
initiate enquiries and make reports;</li>

<li>
consider and advise on matters brought to the Committee by its Minister.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
10. Standing Committees other than Departmental Committees may be established
as may be required from time to time.
<p>11. The Assembly may appoint a special Committee to examine and report
on whether a measure or proposal for legislation is in conformity with
equality requirements, including the ECHR/Bill of Rights. The Committee
shall have the power to call people and papers to assist in its consideration
of the matter. The Assembly shall then consider the report of the Committee
and can determine the matter in accordance with the cross-community consent
procedure.
<p>12. The above special procedure shall be followed when requested by
the Executive Committee, or by the relevant Departmental Committee, voting
on a cross-community basis.
<p>13. When there is a petition of concern as in 5(d) above, the Assembly
shall vote to determine whether the measure may proceed without reference
to this special procedure. If this fails to achieve support on a cross-community
basis, as in 5(d)(i) above, the special procedure shall be followed.
<p><b>Executive Authority</b>
<p>14. Executive authority to be discharged on behalf of the Assembly by
a First Minister
<dir>

responsibilities.</dir>

into office by the Assembly voting on a cross-community basis, according
to 5(d)(i) above.
<p>16. Following the election of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister,
the posts of Ministers will be allocated to parties on the basis of the
d’Hondt system by reference to the number of seats each party has in the
Assembly.
<p>17. The Ministers will constitute an Executive Committee, which will
be convened, and presided over, by the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister.
<p>18. The duties of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will
include, inter alia, dealing with and co-ordinating the work of the Executive
Committee and the response of the Northern Ireland administration to external
relationships.
<p>19. The Executive Committee will provide a forum for the discussion
of, and agreement on, issues which cut across the responsibilities of two
or more Ministers, for prioritising executive and legislative proposals
and for recommending a common position where necessary (e.g. in dealing
with external relationships).
<p>20. The Executive Committee will seek to agree each year, and review
as necessary, a programme incorporating an agreed budget linked to policies
and programmes, subject to approval by the Assembly, after scrutiny in
Assembly Committees, on a cross-community basis.
<p>21. A party may decline the opportunity to nominate a person to serve
as a Minister or may subsequently change its nominee.
<p>22. All the Northern Ireland Departments will be headed by a Minister.
All Ministers will liaise regularly with their respective Committee.
<p>23. As a condition of appointment, Ministers, including the First Minister
and Deputy First Minister, will affirm the terms of a Pledge of Office
(Annex A) undertaking to discharge effectively and in good faith all the
responsibilities attaching to their office.
<p>24. Ministers will have full executive authority in their respective
areas of responsibility, within any broad programme agreed by the Executive
Committee and endorsed by the Assembly as a whole.
<p>25. An individual may be removed from office following a decision of
the Assembly taken on a cross-community basis, if (s)he loses the confidence
of the Assembly, voting on a cross-community basis, for failure to meet
his or her responsibilities including, inter alia, those set out in the
Pledge of Office. Those who hold office should use only democratic, non-violent
means, and those who do not should be excluded or removed from office under
these provisions.<p><b>Legislation</b>
<p>26. The Assembly will have authority to pass primary legislation for
Northern Ireland in devolved areas, subject to:
<dir>
<dir>(a) the ECHR and any Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland supplementing
it which, if the courts found to be breached, would render the relevant
legislation null and void;
<p>(b) decisions by simple majority of members voting, except when decision
on a cross-community basis is required;
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(c) detailed scrutiny and approval in the relevant Departmental Committee;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
(d) mechanisms, based on arrangements proposed for the Scottish Parliament,
to ensure suitable co-ordination, and avoid disputes, between the Assembly
and the Westminster Parliament;
<p>(e) option of the Assembly seeking to include Northern Ireland provisions
in United Kingdom-wide legislation in the Westminster Parliament, especially
on devolved issues where parity is normally maintained (e.g. social security,
company law).</dir>
</dir>
27. The Assembly will have authority to legislate in reserved areas with
the approval of the Secretary of State and subject to Parliamentary control.
<p>28. Disputes over legislative competence will be decided by the Courts.
<p>29. Legislation could be initiated by an individual, a Committee or
a Minister.
<p><b>Relations with other institutions</b>
<p>30. Arrangements to represent the Assembly as a whole, at Summit level
and in dealings with other institutions, will be in accordance with paragraph
18, and will be such as to ensure cross-community involvement.
<p>31. Terms will be agreed between appropriate Assembly representatives
and the Government of the United Kingdom to ensure effective co-ordination
and input by Ministers to national policy-making, including on EU issues.
<p>32. Role of Secretary of State:
<dir>
<dir>(a) to remain responsible for NIO matters not devolved to the Assembly,
subject to regular consultation with the Assembly and Ministers;
<p>(b) to approve and lay before the Westminster Parliament any Assembly
legislation on reserved matters;
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(c) to represent Northern Ireland interests in the United Kingdom
Cabinet;
<p>(d) to have the right to attend the Assembly at their invitation.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
33. The Westminster Parliament (whose power to make legislation for Northern
Ireland would remain unaffected) will:
<dir>
<dir>(a) legislate for non-devolved issues, other than where the Assembly
legislates with the approval of the Secretary of State and subject to the
control of Parliament;
<p>(b) to legislate as necessary to ensure the United Kingdom’s international
obligations are met in respect of Northern Ireland;
<p>(c) scrutinise, including through the Northern Ireland Grand and Select
Committees, the responsibilities of the Secretary of State.</dir>
</dir>
34. A consultative Civic Forum will be established. It will comprise representatives
of the business, trade union and voluntary sectors, and such other sectors
as agreed by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It will
act as a consultative mechanism on social, economic and cultural issues.
The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will by agreement provide
administrative support for the Civic Forum and establish guidelines for
the selection of representatives to the Civic Forum.
<center>
<p><b>Transitional Arrangements</b></center><p>35. The Assembly will meet first for the purpose of organisation, without
legislative or executive powers, to resolve its standing orders and working
practices and make preparations for the effective functioning of the Assembly,
the British-Irish Council and the North/South Ministerial Council and associated
implementation bodies. In this transitional period, those members of the
Assembly serving as shadow Ministers shall affirm their commitment to non-violence
and exclusively peaceful and democratic means and their opposition to any
use or threat of force by others for any political purpose; to work in
good faith to bring the new arrangements into being; and to observe the
spirit of the Pledge of Office applying to appointed Ministers.
<center>
<p><b>Review</b></center>

<p>36. After a specified period there will be a review of these arrangements,
including the details of electoral arrangements and of the Assembly’s procedures,
with a view to agreeing any adjustments necessary in the interests of efficiency
and fairness.

<dir>
<dir>(I) Matters where existing bodies will be the appropriate mechanisms
for co-operation in each separate jurisdiction;
<p>(ii) Matters where the co-operation will take place through agreed implementation
bodies on a cross-border or all-island level.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
10. The two Governments will make necessary legislative and other enabling
preparations to ensure, as an absolute commitment, that these bodies, which
have been agreed as a result of the work programme, function at the time
of the inception of the British-Irish Agreement and the transfer of powers,
with legislative authority for these bodies transferred to the Assembly
as soon as possible thereafter. Other arrangements for the agreed co-operation
will also commence contemporaneously with the transfer of powers to the
Assembly.
<p>11. The implementation bodies will have a clear operational remit. They
will implement on an all-island and cross-border basis policies agreed
in the Council.
<p>12. Any further development of these arrangements to be by agreement
in the Council and with the specific endorsement of the Northern Ireland
Assembly and Oireachtas, subject to the extent of the competences and responsibility
of the two Administrations.
<p>13. It is understood that the North/South Ministerial Council and the
Northern Ireland Assembly are mutually inter-dependent, and that one cannot
successfully function without the other.
<p>14. Disagreements within the Council to be addressed in the format described
at paragraph 3(iii) above or in the plenary format. By agreement between
the two sides, experts could be appointed to consider a particular matter
and report.
<p>15. Funding to be provided by the two Administrations on the basis that
the Council and the implementation bodies constitute a necessary public
function.
<p>16. The Council to be supported by a standing joint Secretariat, staffed
by members of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Irish Civil Service.
<p>17. The Council to consider the European Union dimension of relevant
matters, including the implementation of EU policies and programmes and
proposals under consideration in the EU framework. Arrangements to be made
to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and represented
appropriately at relevant EU meetings.
<p>18. The Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas to consider developing
a joint parliamentary forum, bringing together equal numbers from both
institutions for discussion of matters of mutual interest and concern.
<p>19. Consideration to be given to the establishment of an independent
consultative forum appointed by the two Administrations, representative
of civil society, comprising the social partners and other members with
expertise in social, cultural, economic and other issues.<p>ANNEX
<p>Areas for North-South co-operation and implementation may include the
following:
<dir>
<dir>1. Agriculture - animal and plant health.
<p>2. Education - teacher qualifications and exchanges.
<p>3. Transport - strategic transport planning.
<p>4. Environment - environmental protection, pollution, water quality,

<p><b>BRITISH-IRISH COUNCIL</b>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
1. A British-Irish Council (BIC) will be established under a new British-Irish
Agreement to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development
of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands.
<p>2. Membership of the BIC will comprise representatives of the British
and Irish Governments, devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland
and Wales, when established, and, if appropriate, elsewhere in the United
Kingdom, together with representatives of the Isle of Man and the Channel
Islands.
<p>3. The BIC will meet in different formats: at summit level, twice per
year; in specific sectoral formats on a regular basis, with each side represented
by the appropriate Minister; in an appropriate format to consider cross-sectoral
matters.
<p>4. Representatives of members will operate in accordance with whatever
procedures for democratic authority and accountability are in force in
their respective elected institutions.
<p>5. The BIC will exchange information, discuss, consult and use best
endeavours to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual interest
within the competence of the relevant Administrations. Suitable issues
for early discussion in the BIC could include transport links, agricultural
issues, environmental issues, cultural issues, health issues, education
issues and approaches to EU issues. Suitable arrangements to be made for
practical co-operation on agreed policies.
<p>6. It will be open to the BIC to agree common policies or common actions.
Individual members may opt not to participate in such common policies and
common action.
<p>7. The BIC normally will operate by consensus. In relation to decisions
on common policies or common actions, including their means of implementation,
it will operate by agreement of all members participating in such policies
or actions.
<p>8. The members of the BIC, on a basis to be agreed between them, will
provide such financial support as it may require.
<p>9. A secretariat for the BIC will be provided by the British and Irish
Governments in co-ordination with officials of each of the other members.
<p>10. In addition to the structures provided for under this agreement,
it will be open to two or more members to develop bilateral or multilateral
arrangements between them. Such arrangements could include, subject to
the agreement of the members concerned, mechanisms to enable consultation,
co-operation and joint decision-making on matters of mutual interest; and
mechanisms to implement any joint decisions they may reach. These arrangements
will not require the prior approval of the BIC as a whole and will operate
independently of it.
<p>11. The elected institutions of the members will be encouraged to develop
interparliamentary links, perhaps building on the British-Irish Interparliamentary
Body.
<p>12. The full membership of the BIC will keep under review the workings
of the Council, including a formal published review at an appropriate time
after the Agreement comes into effect, and will contribute as appropriate
to any review of the overall political agreement arising from the multi-party
negotiations.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>

<center><b><font size=+1>BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE</font></b></center>

<dir>&nbsp;
<br>1. There will be a new British-Irish Agreement dealing with the totality
of relationships. It will establish a standing British-Irish Intergovernmental
Conference, which will subsume both the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council
and the Intergovernmental Conference established under the 1985 Agreement.
<p>2. The Conference will bring together the British and Irish Governments
to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual
interest within the competence of both Governments.
<p>3. The Conference will meet as required at Summit level (Prime Minister
and Taoiseach). Otherwise, Governments will be represented by appropriate
Ministers. Advisers, including police and security advisers, will attend
as appropriate.
<p>4. All decisions will be by agreement between both Governments. The
Governments will make determined efforts to resolve disagreements between
them. There will be no derogation from the sovereignty of either Government.
<p>5. In recognition of the Irish Government’s special interest in Northern
Ireland and of the extent to which issues of mutual concern arise in relation
to Northern Ireland, there will be regular and frequent meetings of the
Conference concerned with non-devolved Northern Ireland matters, on which
the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals. These meetings,
to be co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland, would also deal with all-island and cross-border
co-operation on non-devolved issues.
<p>6. Co-operation within the framework of the Conference will include
facilitation of co-operation in security matters. The Conference also will
address, in particular, the areas of rights, justice, prisons and policing
in Northern Ireland (unless and until responsibility is devolved to a Northern
Ireland administration) and will intensify co-operation between the two
Governments on the all-island or cross-border aspects of these matters.
<p>7. Relevant executive members of the Northern Ireland Administration
will be involved in meetings of the Conference, and in the reviews referred
to in paragraph 9 below to discuss non-devolved Northern Ireland matters.
<p>8. The Conference will be supported by officials of the British and
Irish Governments, including by a standing joint Secretariat of officials
dealing with non-devolved Northern Ireland matters.
<p>9. The Conference will keep under review the workings of the new British-Irish
Agreement and the machinery and institutions established under it, including
a formal published review three years after the Agreement comes into effect.
Representatives of the Northern Ireland Administration will be invited
to express views to the Conference in this context. The Conference will
contribute as appropriate to any review of the overall political agreement
arising from the multi-party negotiations but will have no power to override
the democratic arrangements set up by this Agreement.
<br><b><font size=+2></font></b>&nbsp;</dir>

<center><b><font size=+1>RIGHTS, SAFEGUARDS AND EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY</font></b></center>

<dir>&nbsp;
<br><b><font size=+1>Human Rights</font></b>
<p>1. The parties affirm their commitment to the mutual respect, the civil
rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community. Against
the background of the recent history of communal conflict, the parties
affirm in particular:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>• the right of free political thought;
<p>• the right to freedom and expression of religion;
<p>• the right to pursue democratically national and political aspirations;
<p>• the right to seek constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate
means;
<p>• the right to freely choose one’s place of residence;</dir>
• the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless
of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity;
<dir>• the right to freedom from sectarian harassment; and
<p>• the right of women to full and equal political participation.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
<b>United Kingdom Legislation</b>
<p>2. The British Government will complete incorporation into Northern
Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), with direct
access to the courts, and remedies for breach of the Convention, including
power for the courts to overrule Assembly legislation on grounds of inconsistency.
<p>3. Subject to the outcome of public consultation underway, the British
Government intends, as a particular priority, to create a statutory obligation
on public authorities in Northern Ireland to carry out all their functions
with due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity in relation
to religion and political opinion; gender; race; disability; age; marital
status; dependants; and sexual orientation. Public bodies would be required
to draw up statutory schemes showing how they would implement this obligation.
Such schemes would cover arrangements for policy appraisal, including an
assessment of impact on relevant categories, public consultation, public
access to information and services, monitoring and timetables.
<p>4. The new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (see paragraph 5
below) will be invited to consult and to advise on the scope for defining,
in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the European
Convention on Human Rights, to reflect the particular circumstances of
Northern Ireland, drawing as appropriate on international instruments and
experience. These additional rights to reflect the principles of mutual
respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem,
and - taken together with the ECHR - to constitute a Bill of Rights for
Northern Ireland. Among the issues for consideration by the Commission
will be:
<dir>• the formulation of a general obligation on government and public
bodies fully to respect, on the basis of equality of treatment, the identity
and ethos of both communities in Northern Ireland; and
<p>• a clear formulation of the rights not to be discriminated against
and to equality of opportunity in both the public and private sectors.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b>New Institutions in Northern Ireland</b>
<dir>&nbsp;
<br>5. A new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, with membership
from Northern Ireland reflecting the community balance, will be established
by Westminster legislation, independent of Government, with an extended
and enhanced role beyond that currently exercised by the Standing Advisory
Commission on Human Rights, to include keeping under review the adequacy
and effectiveness of laws and practices, making recommendations to Government
as necessary; providing information and promoting awareness of human rights;
considering draft legislation referred to them by the new Assembly; and,
in appropriate cases, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance
to individuals doing so.
<p>6. Subject to the outcome of public consultation currently underway,
the British Government intends a new statutory Equality Commission to replace
the Fair Employment Commission, the Equal Opportunities Commission (NI),
the Commission for Racial Equality (NI) and the Disability Council. Such
a unified Commission will advise on, validate and monitor the statutory
obligation and will investigate complaints of default.
<p>7. It would be open to a new Northern Ireland Assembly to consider bringing
together its responsibilities for these matters into a dedicated Department
of Equality.
<p>8. These improvements will build on existing protections in Westminster
legislation in respect of the judiciary, the system of justice and policing.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
<b>Comparable Steps by the Irish Government</b>
<dir>9. The Irish Government will also take steps to further strengthen
the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction. The Government will,
taking account of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the
Constitution and the Report of the Constitution Review Group, bring forward
measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human
rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights
and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights
and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined
in this context. The measures brought forward would ensure at least an
equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern
Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will:
<dir>• establish a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent
to that within Northern Ireland;
<p>• proceed with arrangements as quickly as possible to ratify the Council
of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities (already ratified
by the UK);
<p>• implement enhanced employment equality legislation;
<p>• introduce equal status legislation; and
<p>• continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for
the different traditions in the island of Ireland.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
<b>A Joint Committee</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<dir>10. It is envisaged that there would be a joint committee of representatives
of the two Human Rights Commissions, North and South, as a forum for consideration
of human rights issues in the island of Ireland. The joint committee will
consider, among other matters, the possibility of establishing a charter,
open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing
agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everyone
living in the island of Ireland.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
<b>Reconciliation and Victims of Violence</b>
<dir>&nbsp;
<br>11. The participants believe that it is essential to acknowledge and
address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element
of reconciliation. They look forward to the results of the work of the
Northern Ireland Victims Commission.
<p>12.<i> </i>It is recognised that victims have a right to remember as
well as to contribute to a changed society. The achievement of a peaceful
and just society would be the true memorial to the victims of violence.
The participants particularly recognise that young people from areas affected
by the troubles face particular difficulties and will support the development
of special community-based initiatives based on international best practice.
The provision of services that are supportive and sensitive to the needs
of victims will also be a critical element and that support will need to
be channelled through both statutory and community-based voluntary organisations
facilitating locally-based self-help and support networks. This will require
the allocation of sufficient resources, including statutory funding as
necessary, to meet the needs of victims and to provide for community-based
support programmes.
<p>13. The participants recognise and value the work being done by many
organisations to develop reconciliation and mutual understanding and respect
between and within communities and traditions, in Northern Ireland and
between North and South, and they see such work as having a vital role
in consolidating peace and political agreement. Accordingly, they pledge
their continuing support to such organisations and will positively examine
the case for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation.
An essential aspect of the reconciliation process is the promotion of a
culture of tolerance at every level of society, including initiatives to
facilitate and encourage integrated education and mixed housing.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>

<center><b><font size=+1>RIGHTS, SAFEGUARDS AND EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY</font></b></center>

<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
<b><font size=+1>Economic, Social and Cultural Issues</font></b>
<dir>&nbsp;
<br>1. Pending the devolution of powers to a new Northern Ireland Assembly,
the British Government will pursue broad policies for sustained economic
growth and stability in Northern Ireland and for promoting social inclusion,
including in particular community development and the advancement of women
in public life.
<p>2. Subject to the public consultation currently under way, the British
Government will make rapid progress with:
<dir>
<dir>(i) a new regional development strategy for Northern Ireland, for
consideration in due course by a the Assembly, tackling the problems of
a divided society and social cohesion in urban, rural and border areas,
protecting and enhancing the environment, producing new approaches to transport
issues, strengthening the physical infrastructure of the region, developing
the advantages and resources of rural areas and rejuvenating major urban
centres;
<p>(ii) a new economic development strategy for Northern Ireland, for consideration
in due course by a the Assembly, which would provide for short and medium
term economic planning linked as appropriate to the regional development
strategy; and
<p>(iii) measures on employment equality included in the recent White Paper
("Partnership for Equality") and covering the extension and strengthening
of anti-discrimination legislation, a review of the national security aspects
of the present fair employment legislation at the earliest possible time,
a new more focused Targeting Social Need initiative and a range of measures
aimed at combating unemployment and progressively eliminating the differential
in unemployment rates between the two communities by targeting objective
need.</dir>
</dir>
3. All participants recognise the importance of respect, understanding
and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern
Ireland, the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various
ethnic communities, all of which are part of the cultural wealth of the
island of Ireland.
<p>4. In the context of active consideration currently being given to the
UK signing the Council of Europe Charter for Regional or Minority Languages,
the British Government will in particular in relation to the Irish language,
where appropriate and where people so desire it:
<dir>• take resolute action to promote the language;</dir>
• facilitate and encourage the use of the language in speech and writing
in public and private life where there is appropriate demand;
<p>• seek to remove, where possible, restrictions which would discourage
or work against the maintenance or development of the language;
<p>• make provision for liaising with the Irish language community, representing
their views to public authorities and investigating complaints;
<p>• place a statutory duty on the Department of Education to encourage
and facilitate Irish medium education in line with current provision for
integrated education;
<p>• explore urgently with the relevant British authorities, and in co-operation
with the Irish broadcasting authorities, the scope for achieving more widespread
availability of Teilifis na Gaeilige in Northern Ireland;
<p>• seek more effective ways to encourage and provide financial support
for Irish language film and television production in Northern Ireland;
and
<p>• encourage the parties to secure agreement that this commitment will
be sustained by a new Assembly in a way which takes account of the desires
and sensitivities of the community.
<p>5. All participants acknowledge the sensitivity of the use of symbols
and emblems for public purposes, and the need in particular in creating
the new institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in
a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division. Arrangements
will be made to monitor this issue and consider what action might be required.</dir>
</dir>

<center><b><font size=+1>DECOMMISSIONING</font></b></center>

<dir>1. Participants recall their agreement in the Procedural Motion adopted
on 24 September 1997 "that the resolution of the decommissioning issue
is an indispensable part of the process of negotiation", and also recall
the provisions of paragraph 25 of Strand 1 above.
<p>2. They note the progress made by the Independent International Commission
on Decommissioning and the Governments in developing schemes which can
represent a workable basis for achieving the decommissioning of illegally-held
arms in the possession of paramilitary groups.
<p>3. All participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total
disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. They also confirm their
intention to continue to work constructively and in good faith with the
Independent Commission, and to use any influence they may have, to achieve
the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years following
endorsement in referendums North and South of the agreement and in the
context of the implementation of the overall settlement.
<p>4. The Independent Commission will monitor, review and verify progress
on decommissioning of illegal arms, and will report to both Governments
at regular intervals.
<p>6. Both Governments will take all necessary steps to facilitate the
decommissioning process to include bringing the relevant schemes into force
by the end of June.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>

<center><b>SECURITY</b></center>

<dir>&nbsp;
<br>1. The participants note that the development of a peaceful environment
on the basis of this agreement can and should mean a normalisation of security
arrangements and practices.
<p>2. The British Government will make progress towards the objective of
as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern
Ireland, consistent with the level of threat and with a published overall
strategy, dealing with:
<dir>(i) the reduction of the numbers and role of the Armed Forces deployed
in Northern Ireland to levels compatible with a normal peaceful society;
<p>(ii) the removal of security installations;
<p>(iii) the removal of emergency powers in Northern Ireland; and
<p>(iv) other measures appropriate to and compatible with a normal peaceful
society.</dir>
3. The Secretary of State will consult regularly on progress, and the response
to any continuing paramilitary activity, with the Irish Government and
the political parties, as appropriate.
<p>4. The British Government will continue its consultation on firearms
regulation and control on the basis of the document published on 2 April
1998.
<p>5. The Irish Government will initiate a wide-ranging review of the Offences
Against the State Acts 1939-85 with a view to both reform and dispensing
with those elements no longer required as circumstances permit.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>

<center><b>POLICING AND JUSTICE</b></center>

<dir>&nbsp;
<br>1. The participants recognise that policing is a central issue in any
society. They equally recognise that Northern Ireland’s history of deep
divisions has made it highly emotive, with great hurt suffered and sacrifices
made by many individuals and their families, including those in the RUC
and other public servants. They believe that the agreement provides the
opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a
police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community
as a whole. They also believe that this agreement offers a unique opportunity
to bring about a new political dispensation which will recognise the full
and equal legitimacy and worth of the identities, senses of allegiance
and ethos of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland. They consider
that this opportunity should inform and underpin the development of a police
service representative in terms of the make-up of the community as a whole
and which, in a peaceful environment, should be routinely unarmed.
<p>2. The participants believe it essential that policing structures and
arrangements are such that the police service is professional, effective
and efficient, fair and impartial, free from partisan political control;
accountable, both under the law for its actions and to the community it
serves; representative of the society it polices, and operates within a
coherent and co-operative criminal justice system, which conforms with
human rights norms. The participants also believe that those structures
and arrangements must be capable of maintaining law and order including
responding effectively to crime and to any terrorist threat and to public
order problems. A police service which cannot do so will fail to win public
confidence and acceptance. They believe that any such structures and arrangements
should be capable of delivering a policing service, in constructive and
inclusive partnerships with the community at all levels, and with the maximum
delegation of authority and responsibility, consistent with the foregoing
principles. These arrangements should be based on principles of protection
of human rights and professional integrity and should be unambiguously
accepted and actively supported by the entire community.
<p>3. An independent Commission will be established to make recommendations
for future policing arrangements in Northern Ireland including means of
encouraging widespread community support for these arrangements within
the agreed framework of principles reflected in the paragraphs above and
in accordance with the terms of reference at Annex A. The Commission will
be broadly representative with expert and international representation
among its membership and will be asked to consult widely and to report
no later than Summer 1999.
<p>4. The participants believe that the aims of the criminal justice system
are to:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<li>
deliver a fair and impartial system of justice to the community;</li>

<li>
be responsive to the community’s concerns, and encouraging community involvement
where appropriate;</li>

<li>
have the confidence of all parts of the community; and</li>

<li>
deliver justice efficiently and effectively.</li>
</dir>

<p><br>5. There will be a parallel wide-ranging review of criminal justice
(other than policing and those aspects of the system relating to the emergency
legislation) to be carried out by the British Government through a mechanism
with an independent element, in consultation with the political parties
and others. The review will commence as soon as possible, will include
wide consultation, and a report will be made to the Secretary of State
no later than Autumn 1999. Terms of Reference are attached at Annex B.
<p>6. Implementation of the recommendations arising from both reviews will
be discussed with the political parties and with the Irish Government.
<p>7. The participants also note that the British Government remains ready
in principle, with the broad support of the political parties, and after
consultation, as appropriate, with the Irish Government, in the context
of ongoing implementation of the relevant recommendations, to devolve responsibility
for policing and justice issues.</dir>

<center>
<p><b>COMMISSION ON POLICING FOR NORTHERN IRELAND</b>
<br><b>Terms of Reference</b></center>

<dir>
<dir>Taking account of the principles on policing as set out in the agreement,
the Commission will inquire into policing in Northern Ireland and, on the
basis of its findings, bring forward proposals for future policing structures
and arrangements, including means of encouraging widespread community support
for those arrangements.
<p>Its proposals on policing should be designed to ensure that policing
arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos
and symbols, are such that in a new approach Northern Ireland has a police
service that can enjoy widespread support from, and is seen as an integral
part of, the community as a whole.
<p>Its proposals should include recommendations covering any issues such
as re-training, job placement and educational and professional development
required in the transition to policing in a peaceful society.
<p>Its proposals should also be designed to ensure that:</dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<li>
the police service is structured, managed and resourced so that it can
be effective in discharging its full range of functions (including proposals
on any necessary arrangements for the transition to policing in a normal
peaceful society);</li>

<li>
the police service is delivered in constructive and inclusive partnerships
with the community at all levels with the maximum delegation of authority
and responsibility;</li>

<li>
the legislative and constitutional framework requires the impartial discharge
of policing functions and conforms with internationally accepted norms
in relation to policing standards;</li>

<li>
the police operate within a clear framework of accountability to the law
and the community they serve, so:</li>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir>• they are constrained by, accountable to and act only within the
law;
<p>• their powers and procedures, like the law they enforce, are clearly
established and publicly available;
<p>• there are open, accessible and independent means of investigating
and adjudicating upon complaints against the police;
<p>• there are clearly established arrangements enabling local people,
and their political representatives, to articulate their views and concerns
about policing and to establish publicly policing priorities and influence
policing policies, subject to safeguards to ensure police impartiality
and freedom from partisan political control;
<p>• there are arrangements for accountability and for the effective, efficient
and economic use of resources in achieving policing objectives;
<p>• there are means to ensure independent professional scrutiny and inspection
of the police service to ensure that proper professional standards are
maintained;</dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<li>
the scope for structured co-operation with the Garda Siochana and other
police forces is addressed; and</li>

<li>
the management of public order events which can impose exceptional demands
on policing resources is also addressed.</li>
</ul>
The Commission should focus on policing issues, but if it identifies other
aspects of the criminal justice system relevant to its work on policing,
including the role of the police in prosecution, then it should draw the
attention of the Government to those matters.
<p>The Commission should consult widely, including with non-governmental
expert organisations, and through such focus groups as they consider it
appropriate to establish.
<p>The Government proposes to establish the Commission as soon as possible,
with the aim of it starting work as soon as possible and publishing its
final report by Summer 1999.

</dir>

<center><b>REVIEW OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</b></center>

<p><b>Terms of Reference</b>
<p>Taking account of the aims of the criminal justice system as set out
in the Agreement, the review will address the structure, management and
resourcing of publicly funded elements of the criminal justice system and
will bring forward proposals for future criminal justice arrangements (other
than policing and those aspects of the system relating to emergency legislation,
which the Government is considering separately) covering such issues as:
<ul>
<li>
the arrangements for making appointments to the judiciary and magistracy,
and safeguards for protecting their independence;</li>

<li>
the arrangements for the organisation and supervision of the prosecution
process, and for safeguarding its independence;</li>

<li>
measures to improve the responsiveness and accountability of, and any lay
participation in the criminal justice system;</li>

<li>
mechanisms for addressing law reform;</li>

<li>
the scope for structured co-operation between the criminal justice agencies
on both parts of the island; and</li>

<li>
the structure and organisation of criminal justice functions that might
be devolved to an Assembly, including the possibility of establishing a
Department of Justice, while safeguarding the essential independence of
many of the key functions in this area.</li>
</ul>
The Government proposes to commence the review as soon as possible, consulting
with the political parties and others, including non-governmental expert
organisations. The review will be completed by Autumn 1999.
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<p><b>PRISONERS</b></center>

<dir>1. Both Governments will put in place mechanisms to provide for an
accelerated programme for the release of prisoners, including transferred
prisoners, convicted of scheduled offences in Northern Ireland or, in the
case of those sentenced outside Northern Ireland, similar offences (referred
to hereafter as qualifying prisoners). Any such arrangements will protect
the rights of individual prisoners under national and international law.
<p>2. Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established
or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit
from the arrangements. The situation in this regard will be kept under
review.
<p>3. Both Governments will complete a review process within a fixed time
frame and set prospective release dates for all qualifying prisoners. The
review process would provide for the advance of the release dates of qualifying
prisoners while allowing account to be taken of the seriousness of the
offences for which the person was convicted and the need to protect the
community. In addition, the intention would be that should the circumstances
allow it, any qualifying prisoners who remained in custody two years after
the commencement of the scheme would be released at that point.
<p>4. The Governments will seek to enact the appropriate legislation to
give effect to these arrangements by the end of June 1998.
<p>5. The Governments continue to recognise the importance of measures
to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community by providing
support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed
towards availing of employment opportunities, re-training and/or re-skilling,
and further education.

<center><b><font size=+1>VALIDATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND REVIEW</font></b></center>

<dir>&nbsp;
<br><b><font size=+1>Validation and Implementation</font></b>
<p>1. The two Governments will as soon as possible sign a new British-Irish
Agreement replacing the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, embodying understandings
on constitutional issues and affirming their solemn commitment to support
and, where appropriate, implement the agreement reached by the participants
in the negotiations which shall be annexed to the British-Irish Agreement.
<p>2. Each Government will organise a referendum on 22 May 1998. Subject
to Parliamentary approval, a consultative referendum in Northern Ireland,
organised under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations,
etc.) Act 1996, will address the question: "Do you support the agreement
reached in the multi-party talks on Northern Ireland and set out in Command
Paper 3883?". The Irish Government will introduce and support in the Oireachtas
a Bill to amend the Constitution as described in paragraph 2 of the section
"Constitutional Issues" and in Annex B, as follows: (a) to amend Articles
2 and 3 as described in paragraph 8.1 in Annex B above and (b) to amend
Article 29 to permit the Government to ratify the new British-Irish Agreement.
On passage by the Oireachtas, the Bill will be put to referendum.
<p>3. If majorities of those voting in each of the referendums support
this agreement, the Governments will then introduce and support, in their
respective Parliaments, such legislation as may be necessary to give effect
to all aspects of this agreement, and will take whatever ancillary steps
as may be required including the holding of elections on 25 June, subject
to parliamentary approval, to the Assembly, which would meet initially
in a "shadow" mode. The establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council,
implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference and the assumption by the Assembly of its
legislative and executive powers will take place at the same time on the
entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.
<p>4. In the interim, aspects of the implementation of the multi-party
agreement will be reviewed at meetings of those parties relevant in the
particular case (taking into account, once Assembly elections have been
held, the results of those elections), under the chairmanship of the British
Government or the two Governments, as may be appropriate; and representatives
of the two Governments and all relevant parties may meet under independent
chairmanship to review implementation of the agreement as a whole.
<p><b><font size=+1>Review procedures following implementation</font></b>
<p>5. Each institution may, at any time, review any problems that may arise
in its operation and, where no other institution is affected, take remedial
action in consultation as necessary with the relevant Government or Governments.
It will be for each institution to determine its own procedures for review.
<p>6. If there are difficulties in the operation of a particular institution,
which have implications for another institution, they may review their
operations separately and jointly and agree on remedial action to be taken
under their respective authorities.
<p>7. If difficulties arise which require remedial action across the range
of institutions, or otherwise require amendment of the British-Irish Agreement
or relevant legislation, the process of review will fall to the two Governments
in consultation with the parties in the Assembly. Each Government will
be responsible for action in its own jurisdiction.
<p>8. Notwithstanding the above, each institution will publish an annual
report on its operations. In addition, the two Governments and the parties
in the Assembly will convene a conference 4 years after the agreement comes
into effect, to review and report on its operation.</dir>

<center><b>AGREEMENT</b><b></b>
<p><b>BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF</b>
<br><b>THE UNITED KINGDOM OF</b>
<br><b>GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND</b>
<p><b>AND</b>
<p><b>THE GOVERNMENT</b>
<br><b>OF IRELAND</b></center>

<p>The British and Irish Governments:
<p>Welcoming the strong commitment to the Agreement reached on 10th April
1998 by themselves and other participants in the multi-party talks and
set out in Annex 1 to this Agreement (hereinafter "the Multi-Party Agreement");
<p>Considering that the Multi-Party Agreement offers an opportunity for
a new beginning in relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island
of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands;
<p>Wishing to develop still further the unique relationship between their
peoples and the close co-operation between their countries as friendly
neighbours and as partners in the European Union;
<p>Reaffirming their total commitment to the principles of democracy and
non-violence which have been fundamental to the multi-party talks;
<p>Reaffirming their commitment to the principles of partnership, equality
and mutual respect and to the protection of civil, political, social, economic
and cultural rights in their respective jurisdictions;
<p>Have agreed as follows:
<p><b>ARTICLE 1</b>
<p>The two Governments:
<p>(i) recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised
by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status,
whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Great Britain
or a sovereign united Ireland;
<p>(ii) recognise that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone,
by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment,
to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent,
freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united
Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved
and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority
of the people of Northern Ireland;
<p>(iii) acknowledge that while a substantial section of the people in
Northern Ireland share the legitimate wish of a majority of the people
of the island of Ireland for a united Ireland, the present wish of a majority
of the people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is
to maintain the Union and accordingly, that Northern Ireland’s status as
part of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish; and that
it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland
save with the consent of a majority of its people;
<p>(iv) affirm that, if in the future, the people of the island of Ireland
exercise their right of self-determination on the basis set out in sections
(i) and (ii) above to bring about a united Ireland, it will be a binding
obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective
Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish;
<p>(v) affirm that whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of
the people of Northern Ireland, the power of the sovereign government with
jurisdiction there shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf
of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and
shall be founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of,
civil, political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination
for all citizens, and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment
for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities;
<p>(vi) recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland
to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as
they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both
British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would
not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.
<p><b>ARTICLE 2</b>
<p>The two Governments affirm their solemn commitment to support, and where
appropriate implement, the provisions of the Multi-Party Agreement. In
particular there shall be established in accordance with the provisions
of the Multi-Party Agreement immediately on the entry into force of this
Agreement, the following institutions:
<dir>
<dir>(i) a North/South Ministerial Council;
<p>(ii) the implementation bodies referred to in paragraph 9 (ii) of the
section entitled "Strand Two" of the Multi-Party Agreement;
<p>(iii) a British-Irish Council;
<p>(iv) a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</dir>
</dir>
<b>ARTICLE 3</b>
<dir>
<dir>(1) This Agreement shall replace the Agreement between the British
and Irish Governments done at Hillsborough on 15th November 1985 which
shall cease to have effect on entry into force of this Agreement.
<p>(2) The Intergovernmental Conference established by Article 2 of the
aforementioned Agreement done on 15th November 1985 shall cease to exist
on entry into force of this Agreement.</dir>
</dir>
<b>ARTICLE 4</b>
<p>(1) It shall be a requirement for entry into force of this Agreement
that:
<dir>
<dir>(a) British legislation shall have been enacted for the purpose of
implementing the provisions of Annex A to the section entitled "Constitutional
Issues" of the Multi-Party Agreement;
<p>(b) the amendments to the Constitution of Ireland set out in Annex B
to the section entitled "Constitutional Issues" of the Multi-Party Agreement
shall have been approved by Referendum;
<p>(c) such legislation shall have been enacted as may be required to establish
the institutions referred to in Article 2 of this Agreement.</dir>
</dir>
(2) Each Government shall notify the other in writing of the completion,
so far as it is concerned, of the requirements for entry into force of
this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the
receipt of the later of the two notifications.
<p>(3) Immediately on entry into force of this Agreement, the Irish Government
shall ensure that the amendments to the Constitution of Ireland set out
in Annex B to the section entitled "Constitutional Issues" of the Multi-Party
Agreement take effect.
<p>In witness thereof the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto by
the respective Governments, have signed this Agreement.
<p>Done in two originals at Belfast on the 10th day of April 1998.
