nd so it was that the lord through his magical powers impregnated the
virgin Mary with his child , the son of god. Seeing this the horned
beast known as Beelzebub or Satan was enraged. He spitteth phlegm of
fire and sulfurous gases erupted from deep within his bowels.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>The Dark Lord then appeared to Mary in the
manger and mounted her like a dog, and there was much moaning and
groaning, and untold rumping and pumping, until he cameth oceans of
black semen into her. And so was created a clild of the
Devil.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>When it was time for Mary to bear child upon
the earth Joseph held her in his arms and called upon God to lessen
her pain. And out popped a little boy child. And Mary named him
"Jesus" because he reminded her of the dead guy who hung on the cross
around her neck. And then out popped a girl child, she was so
beautiful and angelic they called her "Angelica". </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>One day while Jesus and Angelica were playing
dicky back rides in the bathroom there came a knocking upon the door.
Rushing into the hall they saw two men in dark robes talking to their
mother. "Oh no not the fucking Mormons again!" exclaimed Jesus.
However Angelica was curious and went to the door. Upon seeing the
child the men flung themselves to the floor, writhing and screaming
"oh lord protect us!". "What is the matter?" Mary asked. "She bears
the mark of the beast - behold!" and they pointed to the birthmark on
her forehead and Mary saw it did indeed resemble the number
666.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>When Joseph cameth home from working at the
Wall mart and upon hearing the news he smite Angelica and threw her
into the wilderness to die. Forty days and forty nights passed and
Angelica was near to death when some wild stallions came upon her.
Feeling sorry for her they suckled her upon their
seed.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>When the dark lord heard what had become of his
daughter he brought her back to his kingdom, and he vowed "What has
been done to you will be done to them. What you have endured they
will endure one thousand fold. We will let your bastard brother rule
for fifty score years, and then you will return and vengeance will be
ours. Blood will flow and we will drinketh from it's cup.
</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Await the return Angelica my child.
</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>For you will rule the
world.</I></FONT></P></CENTER>
