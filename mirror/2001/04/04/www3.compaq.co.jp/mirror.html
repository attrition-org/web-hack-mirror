<font color=red>W</font>orld <font color=red>o</font>f <font color=red>H</font>ell rooting sites in the year 2001. Looking for new members, if you're interested, <a href="mailto:woh@yours.com">mail us asap</a>. We're looking for coders.. no script kiddies please =)<br><br>
<b>Okay, so Compaq was compromised.</b> ph33r me =)<br><br>
Now, this _is_ interesting. Today we sat down on IRC, and had a discussion.
<pre>
06:24:56 (RuBiX) yo
06:25:03 (RuBiX) I am all out of ideas of domains to own!
06:25:18 (D-Force) me too :-(
06:25:23 (RuBiX) hmm0r
06:25:27 (RuBiX) there must be something.
06:25:30 (RuBiX) think of sony.
06:25:33 (RuBiX) sonymusic.*
06:25:35 (RuBiX) hmm0r
06:25:37 (D-Force) all car brands are already done
06:25:50 (D-Force) we must do more computer related stuff
06:25:50 (RuBiX) lycos?
06:26:13 (D-Force) hp and compaq... stuff like that
</pre>
So basically, WoH are running out of *big* companies to hit. How sad. I think security must be an illusion. <i>"What is real??"</i>
<br><br>
All I am saying is - maybe we will be defacing fewer *big* companies, it depends, until we get some new companies to ./0wn that is =) Maybe _you_ have a big company that we have not owned? Email us.<br><br>
This hack is to show off a logo we got, you like? :)<br><br>
