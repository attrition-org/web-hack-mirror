Where do bad folks go when they die?<br>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly<br>
They go down to the lake of fire and fry<br>
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of july<br>
I knew a lady who came from duluth<br>
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth<br>
She went to her grave just a little too soon<br>
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon<br>
Where do bad folks go when they die?<br>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly<br>
They go down to the lake of fire and fry<br>
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of july<br>
Now the people cry and the people moan<br>
And they look for a dry place to call their home<br>
And try to find some place to rest their bones<br>
While the angels and the devils<br>
Fight to claim them for their own<br>
Where do bad folks go when they die?<br>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly<br>
They go down to the lake of fire and fry<br>
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of july<br>
I knew a lady who came from duluth<br>
