<p>Wake up, American people! DEAR AMERICAN PEOPLE, As people who love peace, we strongly
sugguest American people try your best to stop US government from destroy the peace of the
world. <br>
<br>
  Few weeks ago, US goverment sent war plane to China and bumped our plane down to the
sea. We lost one young people. When US invader came to our airfield, we didn't shoot it
down. We cherish the peace of the world. But we are not afraid of war to protect our
country. We know most people in the world cherish the peace of the world. But US goverment
doesn't. PLS think about how many country it has invaded in recent years. How many lifes
has been lost because of the invasions! Will this arbitrariness bring good to US people?
No other country like it. It's just like relation between people. If a people is welcomed
by others, his chance of success is much higher than those who are disrelished. Besides
economic problems, it may lead you to war. It has bring wars to you. You don't feel the
pain because you don't lose much. But wars between large countries will bring disaster to
both country people. As people who love peace, we strongly sugguest US people try your
best to stop US government from destroy the peace of the world. <br>
