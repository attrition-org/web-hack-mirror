You have hacked my linux server...<br>
It's very interesting.<br>
I am a novice in linux and much interested in hacking.<br>
Could you please let me know how did you hacked my machine?<br>
And one more question, how long does it take to hack like you?<br>

Subject: One more question..<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems that you have hacked my linux machine but you<br>
didn't destroy the system, you just enjoyed the hacking.<br>
Am I right?<br>
Should I format the whole system and re-install the linux?<br>
Or is it not needed? Is it enough action to change the root<br>
password and user password?<br>

Well, I must admit.  I recall breaking your security, but somehow your
address wasn't on my 'list' but thanks for bringing it to my attention!
You don't really need to reformat or reinstall.  I didn't use your root
password.  I made my own!  I'll tell you how to fix it if you really, <b>really</b>
want to.  But it may cost you ...
