            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On 
              April 30,1789, George Washington became the first president of the 
              United States. "As the first of every thing, in our situation will 
              serve to establish a Precedent," he wrote James Madison, "it is 
              devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents may be fixed on 
              true principles."</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Born 
              February 22, 1732 into a Virginia planter family, Washington pursued 
              two interests: military arts and western expansion. At 16 he helped 
              survey Shenandoah lands. In 1754, he fought the first skirmishes 
              of the French and Indian War. He escaped injury although four bullets 
              ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him.<br>
              </font><br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From 1759 to 
              the outbreak of the American Revolution, Washington managed his 
              lands at Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. 
              He devoted himself to a busy life. Like his fellow planters, Washington 
              felt exploited by British merchants and regulations. He moderately 
              but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
              the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 
              1775, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Washington 
              was elected commander in chief of the Continental Army. He took 
              his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that lasted six grueling 
              years. Finally in 1781 - with the aid of French allies - he forced 
              the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Washington 
              longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon. But the nation under 
              its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well, so he became 
              a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention 
              at Philadelphia in 1787. When the new Constitution was ratified, 
              the Electoral College unanimously elected him president.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He 
              did not infringe upon the policy-making powers he felt the Constitution 
              gave Congress. But the determination of foreign policy became a 
              preponderantly presidential concern. When the French Revolution 
              led to a major war between France and England, Washington insisted 
              upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To 
              his disappointment, two parties were developing by the end of his 
              first term. Weary of politics, he retired at the end of his second. 
              In his Farewell Address, he urged his countrymen to forswear any 
              excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions. In foreign 
              affairs, he warned against long-term alliances.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Washington 
              enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon, where 
              he died of a throat infection on December 14, 1799.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Learned and 
              thoughtful, John Adams was more a political philosopher than a politician. 
              "People and nations are forged in the fires of adversity," he said, 
              doubtless thinking of his own as well as the American experience.</font> 
            </p>
            </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adams was born 
              in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on October 30, 1735. A Harvard-educated 
              lawyer and a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, 
              he led in the movement for independence. During the Revolutionary 
              War he served in diplomatic roles, and helped negotiate the treaty 
              of peace. In 1788 he was elected vice president under George Washington.<br>
              <br>
              Adams's two terms as vice president were frustrating. He complained 
              to his wife Abigail, "My country has in its wisdom contrived for 
              me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man 
              contrived or his imagination conceived."</font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Adams became 
              president, the war between the French and British was causing partisanship 
              among factions within the nation. His administration focused on 
              France, where the Directory, the ruling group, had refused to receive 
              the American envoy and had suspended commercial relations. Adams 
              sent commissioners to France, but the Directory refused to negotiate 
              unless they were bribed. Adams reported the insult and the Senate 
              printed the correspondence, in which the Frenchmen were referred 
              to only as "X, Y, and Z. " The nation broke out into what Thomas 
              Jefferson called "the X. Y. Z. fever." The populace cheered itself 
              hoarse wherever the president appeared. The Federalists had never 
              been so popular.<br>
              <br>
              Hostilities began at sea. After several naval defeats, France agreed 
              to receive an envoy with respect. Sending a peace mission to France 
              turned the Hamiltonians against Adams. In the campaign of 1800, 
              the Republicans were united and the Federalists divided. Still, 
              Adams polled only a few less electoral votes than Jefferson, who 
              became president. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Just before 
              the election, Adams had written these words about his new residence, 
              the White House: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I pray Heaven 
              to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall 
              hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule 
              under this roof." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adams retired 
              to his farm in Quincy. Here on July 4, 1826, he whispered his last 
              words: "Thomas Jefferson survives." But Jefferson had died at Monticello 
              a few hours earlier.<br>
