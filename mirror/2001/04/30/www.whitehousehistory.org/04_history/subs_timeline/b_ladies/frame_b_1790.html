            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I think I 
              am more like a state prisoner than anything else, there is certain 
              bounds set for me which I must not depart from..." So did Martha 
              Washington confide that she did not entirely enjoy her role as first 
              of first ladies. She said that though "many younger and gayer women 
              would be extremely pleased," she would "much rather be at home."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But when George 
              Washington assumed the new duties of president of the United States 
              on April 30, 1789, his wife brought to their position a tact and 
              discretion developed over 58 years of life in Tidewater Virginia 
              society. Martha Dandridge was born June 2, 1731, on a plantation 
              near Williamsburg. Typical for a girl in an 18th-century family, 
              her education was negligible except in domestic and social skills, 
              but she learned the arts of a well-ordered household. At age 18, 
              she married the wealthy Daniel Parke Custis. Two babies died, and 
              two others were barely past infancy when Daniel Custis died in 1757.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From the day 
              Martha married George Washington in 1759, her great concern was 
              the comfort and happiness of her new husband and her surviving children. 
              She and George had no children of their own. Her love of private 
              life equaled her husband's, but when his career led him to the battlegrounds 
              of the Revolutionary War and finally to the presidency, she followed 
              him bravely. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At the President's 
              House in the temporary capitals of first New York then Philadelphia, 
              Martha's warm hospitality made her guests feel at ease. She took 
              little satisfaction in "formal compliments and empty ceremonies," 
              and declared that "I am fond only of what comes from the heart." 
              Abigail Adams, who sat at her right during parties and receptions, 
              praised her as "one of those unassuming characters which create 
              Love &amp; Esteem."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1797 the 
              Washingtons said farewell to public life and returned to their beloved 
              Mount Vernon to live surrounded by kinfolk, friends, and a constant 
              stream of guests eager to pay their respects to the celebrated couple. 
              Martha's only daughter Patsy had died at 17, her only son Jack at 
              26, but Jack's children figured in the household. After George Washington 
              died in 1799, Martha assured a final privacy by burning their letters; 
              she died of a "severe fever" on May 22, 1802. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Both lie buried 
              at Mount Vernon, where Washington himself had planned an unpretentious 
              tomb for them.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Inheriting 
              New England's strongest traditions, Abigail Smith was born on November 
              11, 1744 at Weymouth, Massachusetts. On her mother's side she was 
              descended from the Quincys, a family of great prestige in the colony.</font></p>
            </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Like other 
              women of the time, Abigail lacked formal education, but curiosity 
              spurred her keen intelligence, and she read avidly the books at 
              hand. Reading created a bond between her and the young John Adams 
              and they were married in 1764. It was a marriage of the mind and 
              of the heart, enduring for more than half a century.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In ten years 
              she bore three sons and two daughters. Abigail looked after family 
              and home when John went traveling to serve the country they loved. 
              Her letters - pungent, witty, and vivid, spelled just as she spoke 
              - detail her life in times of revolution. They tell the story of 
              a woman who struggled with wartime shortages and inflation, ran 
              the farm with a minimum of help and taught four children when formal 
              education was interrupted. They tell of her loneliness without her 
              "dearest Friend." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1784, she 
              joined him at his diplomatic post in Paris. After 1785, she filled 
              the role of wife of the first United States minister to Great Britain. 
              They returned to Massachusetts in 1788, to the handsome home they 
              had just acquired at Braintree, later called Quincy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As wife of 
              the first vice president, Abigail became a good friend to Martha 
              Washington and a valued help in official entertaining, drawing on 
              her experience of courts and society abroad. After 1791, however, 
              poor health forced her to spend as much time as possible in Quincy. 
              Illness found her resolute. She once declared, she would "not forget 
              the blessings which sweeten life."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When John Adams 
              was elected president in November 1800, Abigail kept the pattern 
              of entertaining even in the primitive conditions of the new capital. 
              The city was wilderness, the President's House far from complete, 
              but for her three months in Washington she duly held official dinners 
              and receptions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Adamses 
              retired to Quincy in 1801, and for 17 Years enjoyed the companionship 
              that public life had long denied them. Abigail Adams died in 1818, 
              and is buried beside her husband in United First Parish Church. 
              She leaves her country a most remarkable record as patriot and first 
              lady, wife of one president and mother of another.</font><br>
