            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The White House 
              is an enduring symbol of our nation&#146;s leadership. It is also 
              the most recognized structure in America. From the beginning, the 
              White House was meant to be a flexible structure. With America not 
              yet a quarter of a century old when John Adams inhabited the President&#146;s 
              House in 1800, it was impossible to foresee how and when the needs 
              of the chief executive would call for expansion, renovation, or 
              redesign. George Washington, who selected the site and approved 
              the final design, knew that the residence and the public buildings, 
              such as the Capitol, would need to serve &quot;beyond the present 
              day.&quot; The White House survived near destruction in the War 
              of 1812, a major expansion in 1902, and a near-total reconstruction 
              in the early 1950s &#151; yet each time the essence of the building 
              was preserved. Amazingly, if George Washington were to see it today, 
              he would easily recognize the structure he once called the &quot;President&#146;s 
              Palace.&quot; </font></p>
            </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1790, Congress 
              passed the Residence Act, which established a permanent national 
              capital to be built on the Potomac River. The Federal City, as it 
              was first known, would need buildings for the national government, 
              and Congress allowed 10 years for them to be built. Secretary of 
              State Thomas Jefferson organized a design contest and Irish-born 
              James Hoban won. Hoban was hired to oversee construction of the 
              White House. In 1800, the federal government moved from its temporary 
              home in Philadelphia to the city that was named Washington.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">President John 
              Adams (1796-1800) and his wife Abigail moved into an unfinished 
              White House in November 1800. Just a few months later, the newly 
              elected president, Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) took Adams&#146;s 
              place. He appointed architect Benjamin Latrobe the &quot;Surveyor 
              of the Public Buildings,&quot; and Latrobe designed and had constructed 
              a replacement for the original roof, which was so heavy that it 
              caused the walls to spread and opened cracks for rain to enter the 
              house. Jefferson designed low-lying colonnaded pavilions that stretched 
              east and west from the house, and Latrobe oversaw their construction 
              in 1808.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Disaster struck 
              in 1814, when the British invaded Washington during the War of 1812. 
              British troops stormed the White House and set it aflame. It was 
              a humiliating defeat for Americans at the hands of their old enemies. 
              The roof and the interior of the White House were destroyed. There 
              was talk of building a new White House from scratch at another location 
              &#151; perhaps even another city &#151; but President James Madison 
              (1809-1817) moved quickly to have Hoban return to reconstruct the 
              building. The selection of Hoban sent a clear message that the White 
              House was to be rebuilt according to the original design. Sections 
              of the original walls were inspected and saved, and the home was 
              ready for James Monroe (1817-1825) to inhabit by September 1817. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a renewed 
              sense of pride in the White House, Congress appropriated $20,000 
              for furnishing the president&#146;s home. James Monroe, who had 
              once served as diplomat in Paris, outfitted the house with elegant 
              gilded French furniture. Today&#146;s touring visitors still see 
              many of these pieces. Throughout the remainder of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
              century, presidents have attempted to furnish the house according 
              to the style of their time. Congress held the purse strings, however, 
              and more often than not the president and first lady felt the budget 
              was inadequate.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As the tasks 
              of the executive grew, and the business of leading the nation became 
              more complex, the private space available for the first family shrunk. 
              Of more than 100 rooms in the White House only a dozen were available 
              for the president&#146;s wife, children, and other relatives who 
              may have taken up residence. The family&#146;s private quarters 
              were located on the second floor, and so were the president&#146;s 
              offices. Those coming to the White House on business would be walking 
              the same halls as the family members. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Theodore 
              Roosevelt (1901-1909) took office in 1901 upon the assassination 
              of President William McKinley, he was the youngest president ever. 
              He brought six children with him and immediately realized that he 
              needed more room. The addition of the West Wing allowed the president&#146;s 
              office and the cabinet room to be moved from the second floor area 
              in the core structure to the new wing. The entire second floor was 
              then available to the first family. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1927 a third 
              floor was added and in 1934 the East Wing was constructed, offering 
              three stories of offices, a bomb shelter, and a movie theater. With 
              each 20<sup>th</sup>-century addition supported by heavy steel trusses, 
              the weight on the original wood beams caused dangerous stress. After 
              a thorough examination by architects and engineers, President Harry 
              S. Truman (1945-1953) ordered a complete renovation of the house. 
              The outer walls remained intact, but the interior was entirely dismantled. 
              Bulldozers dug out two additional basement levels and new foundations 
              bolstered the old sandstone walls. For several years, the president 
              and first lady lived at Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue 
              from the White House. After the renovation was complete in 1952, 
              Truman went on television to give Americans a tour of the remodeled 
              White House. For the first time, millions of Americans had an intimate 
              view of the president&#146;s house. That image has stood for two 
              centuries as the symbol of the American presidency.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
