            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As America&#146;s 
              head of state, the president of the United States welcomes guests 
              from across the country and around the world to the &quot;people&#146;s 
              house.&quot; For many foreign leaders, the White House is their 
              introduction to the United States, and the experience these visitors 
              have at the President&#146;s House may be critical to establishing 
              relations between governments. This was especially true in the 19<sup>th</sup> 
              century, when rules of protocol were strict. Therefore, White House 
              ceremonial events are a mix of the personal and political. Guests 
              must enjoy themselves, while feeling respected and honored in the 
              home of the president, and - if all goes well - depart with a positive 
              view of America and Americans. World leaders who visit may have 
              very little exposure to our nation&#146;s citizenry and so the president 
              and the first family, in essence, represent all Americans. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For his fellow 
              citizens, a president&#146;s invitation to the White House is special. 
              A White House event is often a time for the president to honor his 
              American guests &#151; such as the winners of the Medal of Freedom 
              or the Olympic athletes. Above all, the White House represents the 
              cultural link of home. The president welcomes visitors to his home 
              &#151; whether they hail from the Far East or from just down Pennsylvania 
              Avenue and the halls of Congress. But by extension, the president&#146;s 
              home is the people&#146;s home. The people have allowed the president 
              temporary occupancy, and they expect him to be the most gracious 
              of hosts. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">George Washington 
              conceived the role of the White House, as it was being built in 
              the 1790s, as a place that would command respect at home and abroad. 
              The young republic was an experiment in self-government and Washington 
              believed that foreign diplomats, especially, needed to regard the 
              United States as a formidable and permanent nation. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Washington 
              died before the completion of the White House. The second president, 
              John Adams, was the first chief executive to occupy the structure 
              then known as the &quot;President&#146;s House.&quot; John and Abigail 
              Adams welcomed the public to the first New Year&#146;s Day reception 
              on January 1, 1801, a tradition that would last until the 1930s. 
              The White House was unfinished when they moved in, and the room 
              that was to be the largest and grandest space for parties and ceremonies 
              - the East Room - was used by Mrs. Adams to dry her laundry. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the first 
              half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, &quot;Washington was the one 
              and only American city where, on a few annual occasions, any properly 
              dressed man and woman could enter its grandest and most famous house, 
              walk through its elegantly furnished reception rooms, and sip lemonade 
              or Madeira and eat cake and ice cream with distinguished personages. 
              Fashionable hobnobbing made people feel good about themselves and 
              optimistic about their country.&quot; [Barbara Carson, &quot;Social 
              Seasons and Rituals of Entertainment,&quot; in <i>Our Changing White 
              House</i>, 56-57] </font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The open houses 
              held on New Year&#146;s Day and the Fourth of July were important 
              because they promoted the idea that the people had ready access 
              to their leader, who was in fact the foremost public servant in 
              the country. According to the author of <i>A Description of the 
              Etiquette at Washington City</i> (1829), &quot;At these levees any 
              citizen of a fair character, and of suitable appearance for such 
              a place, may . . . ultimately succeed in being introduced to any 
              individual that attends the levees and parties at Washington . . 
              . . Strangers not particularly distinguished are introduced to [the 
              president] at his levees.&quot; [Carson, 71-72] This offended some 
              Europeans, who were accustomed to a rigid societal hierarchy. The 
              wife of the British prime minister during Jefferson&#146;s administration 
              (1801-1809) was shocked to find herself introduced to her tailor 
              at one party, as if they were of the same social station. Jefferson&#146;s 
              response summed up his thoughts on the issue of who should be welcomed 
              at the White House: &quot;When brought together in society all are 
              perfectly equal, whether foreign or domestic, titled or untitled, 
              in or out of office.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Depending on 
              the president and first lady, and their personal preferences, the 
              White House was more or less accessible to the public. Dolley Madison 
              (James Madison, 1809-1817), an exuberant hostess, brought the waltz 
              to the President&#146;s House. Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe 
              (1817-1825) preferred smaller dinners rather than well-attended 
              evening receptions called levees or drawing rooms. In 1828-29, crowded 
              White House events were relieved with the completion of the East 
              Room. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One of the 
              wildest public occasions in White House history was the reception 
              following the inauguration of Andrew Jackson in 1829, when thousands 
              of well-wishers from all walks of life converged on the White House. 
              They made themselves at home, sipping lemonade and eating ice cream. 
              The scene became so overwhelming, Jackson spent the night at a nearby 
              hotel. The first president to hail from the American frontier, Jackson 
              enjoyed a popular appeal throughout his two terms in the White House. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With expansion 
              of government and those associated with it, coupled with the growth 
              of the Washington population, public functions were curtailed, but 
              New Year&#146;s Day receptions and Fourth of July open houses were 
              still held into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In 1933, however, President 
              Herbert Hoover cancelled the New Year&#146;s Day open house after 
              he shook hands with 6,000 guests. Until then it was the most democratic 
              of the White House events. After World War II and during the Cold 
              War, and especially in response to recent terrorist activities, 
              access to the White House has become very restricted. Gone are the 
              days one could wander over to the front door, knock, and receive 
              a tour of the president&#146;s home. This does not mean, of course, 
              that Americans do not attend special activities and dinners. The 
              house acts as a museum, as well, and more than one million visitors 
              take public tours every year<b>. </b>Click here to take a virtual

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While economic 
              and political business may be at the core of the visit, <b>the state 
              visit</b> is also a social occasion, with the president and first 
              lady as official hosts of a nation. Foreign heads of state - kings, 
              queens, presidents - and other important representatives from around 
              the world are invited to share the home of their counterpart. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Just before 
              the Civil War, President James Buchanan (1857-1861) brought to the 
              White House his experience as a minister to Russia and Great Britain, 
              where he learned the courtly manners of Europe&#146;s receptions. 
              Buchanan was the only bachelor president, but protocol dictated 
              that the White House must have a hostess, and so he turned to his 
              niece, Harriet Lane. The first diplomatic visit from Imperial Japan 
              in 1860 caused a stir, as the public gathered outside the White 
              House to catch a glimpse of the entourage, numbering more than 60, 
              and their exotic outfits. Later in the same year, Queen Victoria&#146;s 
              son Albert, Britain&#146;s Prince of Wales, stayed at the White 
              House. A Washington, D.C., newspaper reporter covered the public 
              reception with the prince and captured the frenzy, as all ranks 
              of society came to meet the man who would one day be crowned King 
              of England: &quot;The rush at the doors was terrible. People clambered 
              in and jumped out of windows. Confusion reigned. The Royal party 
              have certainly seen Democracy unshackled.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The first ruling 
              monarch came to the White House in 1874, when President Ulysses 
              S. Grant welcomed King David Kalakaua of the Sandwich Islands (now 
              Hawaii). British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was the guest 
              of Franklin Roosevelt (1933-1945) on more than a few occasions, 
              and during World War II the allies worked as often as they socialized.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today, the 
              first lady and White House Social Office work with the Protocol 
              Office of the State Department to plan state visits. In the first 
              three years of his presidency, Bill Clinton hosted 12 state visits. 
              Among the guests were France&#146;s President Jacques Chirac, Ireland&#146;s 
              President Mary Robinson, and South Africa&#146;s President Nelson
