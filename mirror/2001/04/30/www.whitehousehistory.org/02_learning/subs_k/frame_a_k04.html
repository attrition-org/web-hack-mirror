            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can the family 
              of the president live a normal life in the White House? The White 
              House is an office, a museum, and a ceremonial stage, but we tend 
              to forget that it is a home, as well. The American public has always 
              been interested in the lives of the president&#146;s wives, children, 
              and other close relatives. Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of Franklin D. 
              Roosevelt (1933-1945), noted: &quot;I doubt if the public realizes 
              the price that the whole family pays in curtailment of opportunity 
              to live a close family life.&quot; When the children of a president 
              leave the house, Secret Service agents are there to protect them. 
              Friends invited over to play at the White House are in awe, at first. 
              After all, it&#146;s not every home that can boast a theatre, swimming 
              pool, tennis courts, and room service. But the first kids are still 
              kids, and although they recognize that their lives are disrupted, 
              they live as normal a life as possible. Above all they try to enjoy 
              the advantages of living in the White House, because their stay 
              is only temporary.</font></p>
            </font> 
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each new presidential 
              family moves into the White House and is given some flexibility 
              in how to use the rooms set aside for them. These rooms are located 
              on the second and third floors. When thought of as a residence, 
              the White House appears enormous, but only about 10% of the space 
              in the house is devoted to the family&#146;s living quarters. There 
              are bedrooms, a living room, and a dining room on the upper floors. 
              There is also a large glass room, or solarium, that provides an 
              informal area for the family to relax. Depending on the time period, 
              there have been between 8 and 15 rooms available for the family.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as the 
              president&#146;s office space in the White House has been set off 
              from the public through various structural renovations, so has that 
              of the first family. It was the large youthful family of Theodore 
              Roosevelt, in fact, that led to the construction of the West Wing 
              in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. This new wing allowed the 
              president's office, which was located on the second floor near the 
              family bedrooms, to be moved, along with all the public traffic 
              of government officials, well-wishers, job-seekers, and clerks.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the first 
              half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, for the most part, young girls 
              and boys living at the White House would have been grandchildren 
              of the president and first lady. The presidents tended to be older 
              men whose children had grown and married by the time they were elected 
              to the nation&#146;s highest office. The first child in the White 
              House was the four-year-old granddaughter of John and Abigail Adams, 
              Susanna. Thomas Jefferson&#146;s daughters visited the President&#146;s 
              House quite often. In 1806, Martha Jefferson Randolph gave birth 
              to a son, James, the first child born at the White House. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1893, the 
              only child of a president and first lady was born in the White House: 
              Esther Cleveland was the daughter of Grover and Frances Cleveland. 
              There was death in the White House, too. Eleven-year-old Willie 
              Lincoln, son of Abraham and Mary Lincoln, died of a fever in 1862; 
              his grieving mother never quite recovered from this tragedy.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First kids 
              have entertained themselves as those across America have, and it 
              seems the public has always enjoyed the exploits of the presidential 
              pets. Theodore Roosevelt&#146;s family may hold the record for number 
              and variety of animals, including a pony named Algonquin, who once 
              rode the White House elevator; a macaw named Eli Yale; and an assortment 
              of dogs, snakes, cats, and raccoons. Caroline Kennedy rode her pony, 
              Macaroni, on the south lawn. A grandchild of President Benjamin 
              Harrison (1889-1893) liked to be pulled on a cart by a goat. The 
              Clintons&#146; pets, Buddy and Socks, are favorites of children 
              around the country.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The children 
              of presidents and first ladies ride the wave of living as celebrities. 
              Jesse Grant, youngest son of Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), wrote 
              a book about growing up as a child of a famous soldier and statesman. 
              He remembered neighborhood friends who &quot;flocked to the White 
              House . . . the largest and best playground available.&quot; Margaret 
              Truman, daughter of Harry Truman (1945-1953) lived in the White 
              House as a college student. She was not thrilled with saying goodnight 
              to her dates, knowing that Secret Service agents were never too 
              far away. Perhaps Susan Ford summed it up best. She was a senior 
              in high school when her father, Gerald Ford (1974-1977), took office. 
              She enjoyed the privileges of living in the White House, and hosted 
              her senior prom there. About privacy she said: &quot;If you&#146;re 
              in your room on the third floor, you have as much privacy as any 
              kid who goes in her room and closes the door.&quot;</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
