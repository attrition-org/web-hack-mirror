            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Why wait until 
              February to learn about the history-making decisions of America&#146;s 
              most recognized leader? Since George Washington essentially invented 
              the office of the president in the 1790s, the nation&#146;s chief 
              executive has rarely stayed on the sidelines when major events unfold. 
              The westward movement, race relations, war, and space exploration 
              are just a few of the topics that young students can examine by 
              learning how these events transpired through the leadership of the 
              president. In essence, you can put a face on history.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The White House 
              is an office, the president&#146;s office. It is where the chief 
              executive and commander in chief does the business of the people. 
              Through two centuries, some of the most critical moments in United 
              States&#146; history have evolved inside the nation&#146;s most 
              famous building. In this lesson, we explore some of them.</font></p>
