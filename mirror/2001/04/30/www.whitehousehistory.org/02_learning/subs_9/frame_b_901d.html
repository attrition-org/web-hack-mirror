              would say later, &quot;No matter who was with me, we watched the 
              big grandfather clock by the door.&quot; Time was running out, for 
              it was Tuesday, January 20, 1981. The scene was the Oval Office. 
              In just hours this president would leave it for good, and a new 
              leader, Ronald Reagan, would move in. As the clock ticked the time 
              away, Carter tried to resolve a crisis that had almost destroyed 
              his presidency. He was close, very close, and as he said, &quot;At 
              stake were the lives of 52 precious human beings who had been imprisoned 
              in Iran for 444 days&#150;and almost 12 billion dollars of Iranian 
              assets.&quot; 1</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Prelude</font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The beginnings 
              of this crisis preceded Jimmy Carter&#146;s term by almost thirty 
              years. For that long, the United States had provided political support 
              and, more recently, massive military assistance to the government 
              of the shah of Iran. Iran was important because it provided oil 
              to the industrial West and separated the Soviet Union from the Persian 
              Gulf and the oil states. The United States had an enormous stake 
              in keeping it stable and independent. By 1979, however, when Carter 
              had been in office three years, the shah was in trouble, reaping 
              the harvest of years of brutal and unpopular policies, including 
              the use of secret police that controlled dissent with arbitrary 
              arrests and torture.2 It was clear that the shah had lost the support 
              of his people, but the president hoped a coalition of the moderate 
              opponents might be formed. The stability of the country, though, 
              was being threatened by a religious fanatic, the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
              Khomeini, who did not like the shah&#146;s efforts to modernize 
              and Westernize a fiercely religious, fundamentalist society. In 
              January 1979, the shah fled into exile, and the theocratic regime 
              of Khomeini took power. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There was little 
              informed understanding in the U.S. government about the political 
              implications of this fundamentalist regime. Gary Sick, who was on 
              the National Security staff<i>,</i> recalled a meeting in which 
              Vice President Walter Mondale asked the Central Intelligence Agency 
              director Stansfield Turner, &quot;What the hell is an &#145;Ayatollah&#146; 
              anyway.&quot; Turner said he wasn&#146;t sure he knew.3 In the beginning, 
              the Carter administration made some effort to establish a relationship 
              with the new government, but by late 1979 it seemed futile. Up until 
              this crisis, few Americans seemed aware of the deep resentments 
              that many Iranian people continued to harbor toward the United States, 
              a country they considered a symbol of Western intrusion into their 
              society.4 Part of the problem stemmed from the desire of the shah, 
              in October 1979, to come to New York City for cancer treatment. 
              Many Iranians remembered a time in 1953 when the prime minister 
              of Iran had challenged the authority of the shah, who in turn, fled 
              the country. However, with the help of a CIA-supported coup, the 
              monarch&#146;s power was restored.5 Now Carter understood that if 
              he allowed the deposed shah to come to the United States., Khomeini&#146;s 
              government would interpret the move as another example of the West&#146;s 
              arrogant interference in Iran&#146;s affairs. Though Carter understood 
              it was a politically volatile decision, he permitted the shah to 
              come, based on a long alliance and &quot;humanitarian principle.&quot; 
              American diplomats in Iran met with the prime minister of the Ayatollah&#146;s 
              government to test reaction to the president&#146;s decision. Though 
              deeply opposed to this U.S. move, the prime minister gave assurances 
              that the Iranian government would protect the safety of diplomatic 
              personnel in Tehran.<br>

            later, on November 4, a mob of 3,000 militants invaded the American 
            embassy in Tehran, taking sixty-six diplomats and military personnel 
            as hostages. The more moderate Iranian prime minister resigned in 
            protest, and Khomeini was in full control. The militants demanded 
            a return of the shah in exchange for the hostages. In the meantime, 
            despite the fact that the Carter administration had arranged for the 
            shah to leave the United States for Panama, the crisis continued unabated. 
            In April 1980, after months of negotiations failed to result in the 
            release of the hostages, the United States broke off diplomatic relations 
            with Iran. Carter approved a hostage rescue mission by an elite paramilitary 
            unit, the American commandos led by Colonel Charles Beckwith.6 It 
            was a dismal failure. Several military helicopters broke down in the 
            desert, and eight commandos died when two aircraft collided during 
            the hasty retreat. The abortive mission seemed to many Americans a 
            symbol of U.S. military weakness in the post-Vietnam era. Carter&#146;s 
            popularity plunged to 20 percent, even lower than Nixon&#146;s during 
            the Watergate scandal.7<br>
            <br>
            The Iranian hostage crisis contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter&#146;s 
            loss of the presidency in the 1980 election. Americans had lost confidence 
            in their leader. It wasn&#146;t difficult. Each night television newscasts 
            relayed images of angry anti-American mobs outside the embassy in 
            Tehran, shouting &quot;Death to America,&quot; &quot;Death to Carter.&quot;8 
            The creation of the television program, <i>Nightline, </i>devoted 
            strictly to discussion of the crisis, was a blatant reminder of Carter&#146;s 
            failure to secure the hostages&#146; release. Each night TV news commentators 
            posted the number of days the hostages had been held in humiliating, 
            terrifying captivity, their president impotent in finding a way to 
            bring them home. &quot;This is the 325<sup>th</sup> day of the Iranian 
            hostage crisis,&quot; the journalists would say, and on and on it 
            went. Election day was the anniversary of the seizure, an irony that 
            wasn&#146;t lost on the American people, who voted for Ronald Reagan 
            by large margins.</font></td>

        He would later say that in those last weeks, the return of the hostages 
        was almost an obsession with him. In his memoir, <i>Keeping Faith, </i>he 
        explained:</font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Of course, their 
            lives, safety, and freedom were the paramount considerations, but 
            there was more to it. I wanted to have my decisions vindicated. It 
            was very likely that I had been defeated and would soon leave office 
            as President because I had kept these hostages and their fate at the 
            forefront of the world&#146;s attention, and had clung to a cautious 
            and prudent policy in order to protect their lives during the preceding 
            fourteen months. Before God and my fellow citizens, I wanted to exert 
            every ounce of my strength and ability during these last few days 
            to achieve their liberation.9</font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It seemed within 
        reach. After months of negotiations the United States had agreed to release 
        several billion dollars in Iranian gold and bank assets, frozen in American 
        banks just after the seizure of the embassy. The government of Iran, now 
        involved in a war with neighboring Iraq, was desperate for money and therefore 
        seemed willing to release the hostages.10 The Iranians refused to communicate 
        directly with the president, or any other American, so Algeria had agreed 
        to act as an intermediary. This arrangement slowed down the negotiating 
        process. As Carter recalled, &quot;The Iranians, who spoke Persian, would 
        talk only with the Algerians, who spoke French. Any question or proposal 
        of mine had to be translated twice as it went from Washington to Algiers 
        to Tehran, and then the answers and counterproposals had to come back 
        to me over the same slow route.&quot;11 Much of the money involved was 
        being held in overseas branches of twelve American banks, so Carter, his 
        cabinet, and staff were constantly on the phone to London, Istanbul, Bonn, 
        and other world capitals to work out the financial details. </font></p>

        in that office until fifteen minutes before the Reagans arrived to begin 
        the inaugural ceremonies. Every force within the government that Carter 
        controlled was poised to accomplish the mission, and now it seemed possible. 
        Carter had already talked to personnel at the U. S. military hospital 
        in Wiesbaden, West Germany, where the hostages would stay for a few days 
        before &quot;re-entry&quot; into the United States. The president hoped

            came a series of small, nerve-racking crises that slowed down the 
            process. At one time that last Sunday, Lloyd Cutler, one of the White 
            House attorneys, told the president there was a delay in the transfer 
            of assets&#150;the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did not have its 
            part of the money! Fortunately, funds were shifted among the reserve 
            banks and the problem was solved. Another difficulty concerned the 
            time difference between Washington and Tehran. Because of the war 
            with Iraq, the Iranian officials had blackouts of airport lights. 
            This meant that once it got dark in Iran (about 9:30 a.m. Washington 
            time), even if the deal had been sealed, the Algerian pilots would 
            not take off until dawn. Thus, if the departure time passed, everyone 
            understood that it would be another eight to ten hours before anything 
            could happen. Work continued through a long night. About 2:00 a.m., 
            the president ordered blankets from the White House steward, and he 
            and Cutler each stretched out on a couch to rest while they waited 
            for news from the negotiations.12 Sometime in the early morning, word 
            came that the planes were on the runway in Tehran, and the hostages 
            had been taken to the vicinity of the airport. The Algerians had even 
            agreed to depart after dark if it was absolutely necessary. Finally, 
            the phone call came through. &quot;We have a deal,&quot; Jimmy Carter 
            said, beaming. Someone popped a bottle of champagne. At 4:44 a.m. 
            Carter went to the press briefing room to announce that with the help 
            of Algeria the United States and Iran had reached an agreement.13 
            Certain &quot;implementation&quot; steps in the agreement needed to 
            be settled, and the hostages would be free.</font></td>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then came another 
        delay. The Algerian negotiator sent word that the Iranian bank officials 
        did not agree with the terms of accountability in the banking agreements. 
        They wouldn&#146;t cooperate. The planes were returned to their standby 
        position. Hours passed, and still no word came that the problem had been 
        resolved. A Carter aide had calculated that the president would have to 
        leave Washington no later than 2:00 p.m. Monday afternoon if he wanted 
        to see the hostages in Wiesbaden and be back in time for the inauguration. 
        Hamilton Jordan, White House chief of staff, asked the president if he 
        <i>had</i> to go to the inauguration. Carter reminded Jordan that the 
        inauguration was a symbol of the continuity of the government. Yes, despite 
        the importance of the negotiations, he did need to attend! The staff soon 
        understood that Carter&#146;s trip to Germany to greet hostages would 
        not occur until after the inauguration. The president switched from worrying 
        about seeing the hostages before the end of the term, to worrying that 
        the entire negotiation process could disintegrate. Carter talked with 
        Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who was in communication 
        with the Algerian foreign minister. He told Christopher to warn the Algerians 
        that the Carter presidency would end the next day at noon. &quot;After 
        that,&quot; he said, &quot;neither Christopher nor I could speak for the 
        United States, and the entire negotiating process might have to begin 
        anew.&quot;14</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the wee hours 
        of Tuesday, January 20, came some promising news. The processes required 
        to move the money through the proper channels were almost completed. Only 
        a few small details were to be ironed out. At 6:35 a.m., Christopher sent 
        a message: &quot;All escrows were signed at 6:18. The Bank of England 
        has certified that they hold $7.977 billion, the correct amount.&quot; 
        Now the bank would send word to Algiers by telex or phone, which would 
        notify Iran. At 7:45 a.m., with messages still coming in fast and furious, 
        Rosalyn Carter brought her husband a razor, telling him, &quot;You need 
        a shave.&quot; The barber was with her, to give Carter&#146;s hair a trim 
        before the inaugural ceremonies. Rosalyn remembered that as she was leaving 
        the Oval Office to go back upstairs, Jimmy answered one more call, and 
        then yelled out for everyone to hear: &quot;Flight 133 is loaded and ready 
        for take-off.&quot; Once more, there came elation, cheers, and hugs. At 
        8:04 a.m., Algeria confirmed that the bank certification was complete, 
        and the Algerians were notifying Iran. That was it! Every step was complete. 
        Per the agreement, Iran would move to &quot;immediately bring about the 
        safe departure of the 52 nationals detained in Iran.&quot;15<br>

          <td valign="top" width="573"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Still 
            Carter lingered in the Oval Office. Word had not yet come that the 
            hostages had left the ground in Tehran. At 9:45 a.m., Christopher 
            called one last time and told Carter takeoff would be by noon, but, 
            as a security measure, the Iranian officials did not want the word 
            released until the hostages were out of Iranian airspace. President 
            Carter said the United States would comply. Then Rosalyn came to the 
            door, and said, &quot;Jimmy, the Reagans will be here in fifteen minutes. 
            You will have to put on your morning clothes and greet them.&quot;16<br>
            <br>
            After the inauguration, a Secret Service agent pushed through the 
            crowd at the U.S. Capitol to tell former president Jimmy Carter that 
            at 12:33 p.m. the first plane carrying the hostages had taken off 
            from Tehran, and the second one had left nine minutes later. President 
            Ronald Reagan got the word at an inaugural luncheon. It was the first 
            official announcement he would make to the American people. The hostages, 
            on the 444<sup>th</sup> day of their captivity, were set free. The 
            republic rejoiced!</font></td>
