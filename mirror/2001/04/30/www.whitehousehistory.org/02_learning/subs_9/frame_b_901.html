            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was about 
              noon, on Saturday November 1, 1800, when the second president of 
              the United States, John Adams, arrived in Washington City and went 
              immediately to the &quot;President&#146;s House.&quot; This residence 
              was the outgrowth of George Washington&#146;s dream for a capital 
              city, though it would not be completed during his presidency. Pierre 
              Charles L&#146;Enfant had designed the city, but Washington himself 
              sited the location of the White House. When John Adams moved in 
              that November day, the house, designed by the Dublin builder James 
              Hoban, was as yet unfinished. Only half of its thirty-six rooms 
              had been plastered, just one of the three planned staircases was 
              completed, and the watchman was keeping all of the fireplaces burning 
              to dry the plaster. Still, the president&#146;s baggage was unloaded, 
              his office prepared. He received &quot;gentlemen&quot; all of that 
              late afternoon, took his dinner early, and with one lit candle made 
              his way up the only finished staircase in the house to his bedroom. 
              The next day he penned these words: &quot;I pray Heaven to bestow 
              the best of blessings on this house, and on all that shall hereafter 
              inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this

                  Just a few months after Adams moved into the White House, Thomas

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There was no mention 
        of political parties in the Constitution; indeed, the Founding Fathers 
        feared such &quot;factions,&quot; noting examples from European history 
        where the presence of such devious elements had resulted in the downfall 
        of governments. By unanimous vote of the Electoral College in both 1789 
        and 1792, George Washington had been elected the first president of the 
        United States. Both a listener and a leader, Washington managed to hold 
        the country in relative harmony, warning his fellow-citizens, &quot;You 
        cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies . . . which spring 
        from [faction].&quot;2 Yet disagreements between Washington&#146;s secretary 
        of treasury, Alexander Hamilton, and his secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson, 
        led to the formation of two distinctly political camps, exactly what Washington 
        had cautioned against. Supporters of Jefferson&#146;s viewpoints formed 
        political groups. Especially opposed to the financial policies related 
        to taxation and banking proposed by Hamilton and adopted by Washington, 
        they called themselves &quot;Republicans,&quot; leaving to the administration&#146;s 
        supporters the name of &quot;Federalists.&quot;</font></p>

      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One great dispute 
        between the Federalists and the Republicans centered on events in Europe. 
        In 1789 the French had risen up against the monarchy and three years later 
        declared themselves a republic. As the revolution grew more radical in 
        the 1790s, with its attacks on organized religion and eventually the execution 
        of the king and queen, the aristocratic Federalists watched in horror. 
        The Republicans, though, applauded the democratic, anti-aristocratic spirit 
        of the French Revolution. Some even imitated the French Jacobins, cutting 
        their hair short and addressing each other as &quot;citizen&quot; and 
        &quot;citizeness.&quot; When France went to war with Britain in 1793, 
        not surprisingly, the Jeffersonian Republicans favored the French cause, 
        and the Federalists, the British. Though George Washington declared the 
        United States would remain neutral, soon American foreign affairs became 
        a violent partisan issue. </font></p>

          <td valign="top" width="573"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While 
            the Republicans were not as organized as a modern political party, 
            they nearly won the presidency for Jefferson in 1796. Adams defeated 
            Jefferson 71 electoral votes to 68. The writers of the Constitution, 
            having not considered the emergence of political parties, had declared 
            that the candidate with the second largest electoral vote would be 
            vice president. This meant that Jefferson, as the runner-up, would 
            be in the administration of a Federalist president, although he was 
            the leader of the opposition party! With Jefferson in the second position 
            of power, and the tempering influence of George Washington gone, the 
            prickly, intellectual John Adams was in for a rough political ride. 
            The political environment was kept constantly charged as each side 
            courted the support of newspapers, which vied with one another in 
            viciously attacking both the leaders and the policies of the opposition. 
            As war between France and Britain entered a more active phase in 1798, 
            both Federalists and Republicans hurled charges of disloyalty to American 
            interests at each other. Though the charges continued unabated on 
            both sides, the fact was that, by 1798, the United States had all 
            but abandoned its neutrality in this European war by aligning itself 
            more and more with Britain. Moreover, beginning that year, the nation 
            found itself engaged in a two-year undeclared naval war with France.

      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Federalists, 
        who controlled the Congress, used this undeclared war as a pretext for 
        passing some of the most repressive pieces of legislation in American 
        history: the Alien and Sedition Acts<i>.</i> The Federalists claimed that 
        the laws were meant to protect the United States against alien agitators, 
        &quot;foreign firebrands&quot; of &quot;unstable political persuasion&quot; 
        who were pouring into the country in the wake of European wars and revolution. 
        Many Americans felt that the chief goal was to weaken the Republicans 
        who usually attracted these immigrants into their party ranks. Though 
        the Alien Acts<i> </i>were never enforced, some believed they frightened 
        out of the country certain foreigners, especially Frenchmen, and discouraged 
        many others from coming to the country. The Sedition Act<i>,</i> though, 
        seemed a direct slap at two priceless freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution 
        by the Bill of Rights: freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Even 
        Alexander Hamilton disapproved of the law. It provided fines and imprisonment 
        for any person who uttered or wrote &quot;false, scandalous, and malicious&quot; 
        statements against Congress or the president. The outright political purpose 
        of the act was admitted in the date it was to expire: March 1801, when 
        the next president would take power.3 Though Adams was reasonably cautious 
        in implementing these laws, they had a significant repressive effect, 
        enough to justify the fears of the Republicans that they were tyrannical 
        in intent. 4 Many outspoken Jeffersonian editors were indicted under the 
        Sedition Act<i>,</i> though only ten were actually convicted.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Protest</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Republicans were 
        alarmed. It seemed that the Federalists were prepared to abandon the principles 
        of the Enlightenment and the Constitution. In late 1798 the Kentucky and 
        Virginia state legislatures adopted resolutions (written by Jefferson 
        and James Madison, respectively) calling the Alien and Sedition Acts<i> 
        </i>unconstitutional and declaring that the states had the power to declare<i> 
        any</i> such &quot;illegal&quot; federal law unconstitutional. The Kentucky 
        Resolutions went further, arguing that unconstitutional acts passed by 
        the national government [in this case violating First Amendment freedoms 
        of speech and press] may be declared &quot;null and void&quot; by state 
        governments. These resolutions began a state-rights debate that would 
        continue through the Civil War. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Though this nullification 
        idea did not win widespread support, it elevated the dispute to the level 
        of a national crisis. Some historians believe that even by modern standards, 
        the United States, by the late 1790s, was as deeply and bitterly politicized 
        as it would ever be in its history. State legislatures at times resembled 
        battlegrounds, and some sessions ended in fistfights and brawls. The writers 
        of <i>American History</i> provide a vivid example: &quot;In one celebrated 
        incident in the chamber of the House of Representatives, Matthew Lyon, 
        a Republican from Vermont, responded to an insult from Roger Griswold, 
        a Federalist from Massachusetts, by spitting in Griswold&#146;s eye. Griswold 
        then attacked Lyon with his cane, Lyon fought pack with a pair of tongs, 
        and soon the two men were engaged in a wrestling match on the floor.&quot; 
        This same Congressman Lyon was later sentenced to four months in jail 
        for writing of President Adams&#146;s unbounded thirst for &quot;ridiculous 
        pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.&quot;5 Such ferocity alarmed 
        Americans and made them wonder if the nation was on the verge of chaos. 
        This and many other incidents strengthened the resolve of the Republicans 
        to organize, especially at the local level, to win the election of 1800.</font></p>

            campaign that year was probably the ugliest in American history. Adams 
            was campaigning for re-election as a Federalist with Charles C. Pinckney. 
            Jefferson represented the Republicans, with Aaron Burr as his running 
            mate. Adams and Jefferson themselves were fairly restrained in their 
            accusations, but their supporters were rabid. Each side argued that 
            their opponents threatened the very existence of the republic. The 
            Federalists called Jefferson a dangerous radical, and his followers 
            &quot;mad men&quot; who, it they came to power, would bring a &quot;reign 
            of terror&quot; comparable to that of the French Revolution at its 
            bloodiest. Republicans saw Adams as a tyrant conspiring to restore 
            the monarchy and make himself king; his party members, they accused, 
            were &quot;plotting to subvert human liberty and impose slavery on 
            the people.&quot; 6</font></td>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then, as if the tense 
        political atmosphere wasn&#146;t concern enough, the election revealed 
        a constitutional problem in the electoral process. Again, with &quot;political 
        tickets&quot; not anticipated by the Founders, Jefferson and his running 
        mate, Aaron Burr, both Republicans, received the exact same number of 
        electoral votes. According to the Constitution, such ties had to be broken 
        in the House of Representatives. It took one week and thirty-six separate 
        ballots to determine the outcome. Finally, in February 1801, word came 
        that Thomas Jefferson would be the next president of the United States. 
        The tensions surrounding the election had run so high that John Adams 
        discussed with his wife resigning from the presidency a few days early 
        &quot;to make sure his presence did not inflame the jubilant Republicans 
        at Jefferson&#146;s inauguration.&quot; She had discouraged him. President 
        Adams and Jefferson had met in Washington from time to time. One day, 
        after the election, they had a rather uncomfortable encounter&#150;some 
        say it took place in the White House. &quot;&#145;You have put me out!&#146; 
        Adams is said to have snapped. &#145;You have put me out!&#146; Although 
        taken aback, Jefferson calmly reminded him of the character of the system 
        he&#150;not Jefferson&#150;had helped invent. The interview ended on friendly 
        terms.&quot;7<b> </b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Departure</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Though deeply troubled, 
        Adams and the Federalists accepted their loss of control of both Congress 
        and the executive department. Yet in his last days in office, Adams would 
        use his time to further the Federalist cause. He made appointments, as 
        Jefferson once said, &quot;from among my most ardent political enemies.&quot; 
        Judgeships, justices of the peace, custom officers&#150;the appointment 
        papers flowed in a steady stream from the White House to the State Department. 
        These appointments would be known as the &quot;Midnight Judges.&quot; 
        8 One of Adams&#146;s most important acts was to appoint John Marshall, 
        a Federalist, as chief justice of the United States Supreme Court. Finally, 
        on March 4, 1801, in the early morning hours of Jefferson&#146;s Inauguration 
        Day, Adams&#146;s coach drew up to the door of the White House, with several 
        wagons of packed furnishings behind. Even before sunrise, Adams was headed 
        northward, back to Massachusetts, leaving the inaugural ceremonies and 
        the White House to Jefferson.</font></p>
      <b>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A Beginning</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now the Republicans 
        were in power. What actions would they take against their political enemies? 
        Jefferson gave a conciliatory response in his inaugural address, saying, 
        &quot;We are all republicans, we are all federalists.&quot; He didn&#146;t 
        remove Federalists from office either, though he did require their loyalty. 
        The historian Edwin Fenton notes, &quot;After the bitterness of the 1790&#146;s, 
        a calmer spirit prevailed in the nation. A challenge had been met; the 
        leadership of the nation had changed peacefully. Political opposition 
        within a constitutional framework would be tolerated and eventually praised 
        rather than driven underground and punished.&quot;9 As Margaret Bayard 
        Smith, a Republican woman who attended Jefferson&#146;s inauguration, 
        mused, &quot;The changes of administration which in every government and 
        in every age have generally been epochs of confusion, villainy, and bloodshed, 
        in this our happy country take place without any species of distraction, 
        or disorder.&quot; 10<br>
