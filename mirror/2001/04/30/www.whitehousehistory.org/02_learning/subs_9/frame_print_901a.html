            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">November 1, 
              2000, will mark the two-hundredth anniversary of the occupancy of 
              the White House. George Washington is the only president who did 
              not live in the &quot;President&#146;s House,&quot; as it was called 
              at the time, though he had much to do with its planning and development. 
              Each president who has lived in the White House has altered or improved 
              it in some way. Yet as constitutional guidelines dictate, presidential 
              power is held only under certain conditions. New presidents are 
              elected, and on Inauguration Day, within a period of only a few 
              hours, out moves a family who called the White House home and in 
              moves another. The house is also the president&#146;s office, but 
              no matter what the crisis or circumstance, there comes a time when 
              the chief executive leaves the business of the nation to his successor. 
              The house endures, as does the nation&#146;s government&#150;albeit 
              with changes and alterations&#150;but its chief occupants come and 
              go. Thus the house is a symbol of the orderly transition of power 
              characteristic of the federal republic. On several occasions in 
              American history, during unusual or difficult situations, this concept 
              of orderly transition has been tested. In each case the republic 
              endured.</font></p>

              examines four such<b> </b>transitions, described briefly below. 
              <b>A study of each will strengthen students&#146; understanding 
              about the stabilizing effect of both precedent and constitutional

              Inauguration of Thomas Jefferson After the First Change of Political 
              Party Power, March 4, 1801</font></i></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was an 
              event of great significance because it marked the first occasion 
              under the new Constitution when executive power passed quietly from 
              one political party to another. Though the Constitution did not 
              anticipate political parties, two had emerged: the Federalists and 
              the Republicans. The rivalry between the parties was fierce. The 
              Federalists accused Thomas Jefferson, the leader of the Republicans, 
              of being a dangerous radical, his followers &quot;mad men&quot; 
              who, if they came to power, would bring a &quot;reign of terror&quot; 
              comparable to that of the French Revolution at its lowest point. 
              The Jeffersonian Republicans denounced President John Adams as a 
              monarchist, a man who under the right circumstances might seek to 
              become king. They accused his Federalist compatriots of being &quot;ready 
              to conspire with the enemies of the country,&quot; especially the 
              British. The differences between the two groups were so pronounced 
              that when Jefferson won the presidency, he called his triumph the 
              &quot;Revolution of 1800.&quot; Yet, despite the viciousness of 
              the debate that preceded the election, the Federalists accepted 
              their loss of control, not only of the executive branch but also 
              of Congress. 1 The republic lurched, and rolled on.</font></p>

              Early Days of Lyndon B. Johnson&#146;s Presidency Following John 
              F. Kennedy&#146;s Assassination on November 22, 1963</i></font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eight times 
              in the history of the republic a vice president has become president 
              because of the death of his predecessor. On November 22, 1963, President 
              John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation and 
              the world were in a state of anguish and shock. The loss of a leader 
              who was so young and vital, so charming and full of promise, seemed 
              incomprehensible. Few had given any thought to the possibility of 
              Kennedy not completing his term in office. Lyndon Baines Johnson, 
              the vice president, had been chosen primarily to &quot;balance the 
              ticket.&quot; Yet, on that November day, Johnson was sworn in as 
              president aboard <i>Air Force One</i> before it left the ground 
              in Dallas. Though fears abounded about a conspiracy of assassins, 
              and some questioned the nation&#146;s security, the new president 
              calmly took up his duties the following morning. Despite the people&#146;s 
              grief and deep concerns, Johnson, through &quot;his public appearances, 
              his use of language, his management of the press promoted feelings 
              of continuity and unity.&quot;2 The republic mourned, and began 
              again.</font></p>

              Appointment of Gerald R. Ford to the Vice Presidency, and His Subsequent 
              Rise to the Presidency Following Nixon&#146;s Resignation, August 
              9, 1974</i></font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Gerald 
              Ford took the oath of office, he declared, &quot;I assume the Presidency 
              under extraordinary circumstances. . . . This is an hour of history 
              that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.&quot; It truly was 
              an unprecedented time. Ford was the first vice president chosen 
              under the terms of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, replacing Spiro Agnew, 
              who resigned after pleading &quot;no contest&quot; to charges of 
              fraud. Then, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Ford succeeded 
              the first president ever to resign, Richard M. Nixon. President 
              Ford nominated as his vice president Nelson Rockefeller, who was 
              confirmed by both houses of Congress and was sworn in on December 
              19, 1974. As the writers of <i>The National</i> <i>Experience </i>point 
              out, &quot;For the first time in history, both the President and 
              the Vice President had come to office and power not, like all their 
              predecessors, though election but through appointment.&quot;3 It 
              was a measure of the Constitution&#146;s efficacy that this unusual 
              situation caused no crisis in public opinion. The republic argued 
              and questioned, then pressed on.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On November 
              4, 1979, three thousand fanatical Iranian students invaded the U.S. 
              Embassy in Tehran and seized sixty-six Americans as hostages. It 
              was the most fateful day of the presidency of Jimmy Carter. By the 
              November 1980 election, the hostages had been in captivity more 
              than a year. Ronald Reagan&#146;s electoral landslide was in part 
              attributed to Carter&#146;s inability to secure the release of these 
              hostages. Until the final moments before Reagan&#146;s inauguration, 
              Carter worked feverishly in the Oval Office to finalize the negotiations 
              with the Iranians. Despite the fact that a settlement had finally 
              been reached, the Iranians delayed permission for the planes carrying 
              the hostages to leave. Regardless of Carter&#146;s efforts to resolve 
              the crisis, at exactly 12:00 noon that January 20, Ronald Reagan 
              took the oath of office as the president of the United States. At 
              12:33 p.m., the first aircraft lifted off a runway in Tehran. As 
              the planes left Iranian airspace, President Reagan, attending a 
              luncheon at the Capitol, made the first official announcement of 
              his presidency: the hostages were free. The republic rejoiced.<br>
