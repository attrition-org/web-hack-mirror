            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In that week 
              before Thanksgiving, President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline 
              traveled to Texas. The trip was political&#150;Kennedy was unsure 
              of his support in this southern state. In the previous two years, 
              very little Texas money had come into the coffers of the Democratic 
              National Committee, and more and more Texas voters who opposed Kennedy&#146;s 
              civil rights stance were joining Republican ranks. He wanted to 
              raise money and improve his image in this important pivotal state 
              for the 1964 election. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his 
              wife, Lady Bird, would meet the Kennedys in San Antonio when they 
              arrived on November 21. The president needed Johnson&#146;s help. 
              He hoped that the vice president&#146;s considerable political influence 
              in his home state might help mend a rift in the Democratic Party 
              there. </font></p>
            </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That fateful 
              afternoon in Dallas, November 22, 1963, Johnson and Lady Bird were 
              in the fourth car of a motorcade taking the Kennedys to a downtown 
              business district where the president was scheduled to make a speech. 
              Johnson remembered distinctly hearing the rifle shots that took 
              Kennedy&#146;s life, then the confusion and shock that followed 
              as a secret service agent pushed him to the floor of the Lincoln, 
              shouting, &quot;Get down! Get down.&quot;1 Forty-five minutes later 
              at Parkland Memorial Hospital, the head of Kennedy&#146;s Secret 
              Service detail came to tell the Johnsons that the presidents wounds 
              were very serious, and the vice president should fly back to Washington 
              immediately in case there was a widespread conspiracy that could 
              threaten him as well. Ten minutes later the agent returned with 
              the news that the president was dead.2<br>

      </b>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">CBS-TV interrupted 
        its afternoon soap opera, <i>As the World Turns,</i> to give Americans 
        their first inkling of what loomed on the national horizon. A distraught 
        Walter Cronkite relayed a UPI report from Dallas that three shots had 
        been fired at Kennedy, adding that apparently &quot;the president was 
        &#145;seriously wounded.&#146;&quot; Then, a few minutes later, Cronkite 
        delivered the dreaded news: &quot;From Dallas, a flash, apparently official, 
        President Kennedy died at 1:00 p.m. central standard time, 2:00 eastern 
        standard time, some thirty-eight minutes ago.&quot; 3 The seasoned professional 
        commentator took off his glasses and wiped tears from his eyes. From these 
        early telecasts the word spread like wildfire. The nation, and soon the 
        world, was in a state of grief and anguish. How could such a young, vibrant 
        president, so full of plans and promise, be dead? In Dallas, Lyndon Johnson 
        understood immediately the need to act quickly so the people would not 
        panic. His ability to think on his feet and make quick decisions, skills 
        that had been tamped down by his shadow role as vice president, now came 
        to the fore. Though he would later be criticized for it, he immediately 
        insisted that he would take the president&#146;s plane, <i>Air Force One,</i> 
        back to Washington. Not only that, but he would have the swearing-in ceremony 
        before taking off.<br>

        Legitimacy</font></b></font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Johnson had several 
        reasons for these actions, not the least of which, according to a Kennedy 
        associate, was &quot;a compelling desire to calm a frantic people and 
        reassure a shocked world.&quot; Moreover, though he had actually succeeded 
        to the office of the presidency when Kennedy died, Johnson wasn&#146;t 
        sure of that. He believed his swearing-in would establish his &quot;legitimate 
        hold on the presidency.&quot; If there was a conspiracy and he needed 
        to take some counteraction, he wanted the clear authority to act. 4 Finally, 
        as if to seal the legitimacy of the transfer of power, he insisted that 
        the slain president&#146;s wife stand beside him as he was sworn in aboard 
        <i>Air Force One</i>. At 2:30 p.m., less than an hour and a half after 
        Kennedy&#146;s death, Lyndon Baines Johnson took the oath of office. When 
        the plane touched down late that evening at Andrews Field near Washington, 
        the people of the United States had a president. Johnson made his first 
        televised statements there, then was taken by helicopter directly to the 
        White House. </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was 4:34 a.m., 
        November 23, when the casket of John F. Kennedy, now covered by an American 
        flag, was carried into the White House and placed upon the catafalque 
        in the East Room.5 Neither the nation nor Johnson could have believed 
        that the vice president would be called upon to fill out the term of this 
        young president who now lay dead. In fact, many believed that Johnson 
        was in a dead-end job. Once he had been powerful&#150;the youngest Senate 
        majority whip in 1953, Senate majority leader two years later at the age 
        of forty-six.6 In 1955, the same year he rose to majority leader, and 
        just as his name was circulating as a possible presidential candidate, 
        Johnson suffered a massive heart attack. He had to slow down, something 
        that was very difficult for a man of great ambition and energy. Unable 
        to regain political momentum after his recovery, he lost his 1960 chance 
        for the presidency to the young John F. Kennedy. To the amazement of many 
        who had seen Johnson wield power for thirty-two years, Johnson agreed 
        to &quot;balance the Democratic ticket&quot; and become Kennedy&#146;s 
        running mate. That November the Democrats won by a narrow margin. For 
        the most part, Johnson was relegated to the role of chairing advisory 
        committees and making goodwill trips&#150;to Senegal, the Philippines, 
        Thailand, India, Pakistan, and South Vietnam. As vice president to the 
        youngest man ever elected president, many believed that Johnson&#146;s 
        days as a powerful national figure were over. President Johnson must have 
        thought of what John Adams had written when he was vice president: &quot;I 
        am vice president. In this I am nothing, but I <i>may be everything</i>.&quot;

            would be anxiously following every move I made&#150;watching, judging, 
            weighing, balancing. It was imperative that I grasp the reins of power 
            and do so without delay. Any hesitation or wavering, any false step, 
            any sign of self-doubt, could have been disastrous.9</font></p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The United States 
        has a constitutional framework that defines a set of procedures for a 
        vice president who succeeds to the office of the presidency, but it was 
        not inevitable that the transition would be as smooth as it was. Johnson&#146;s 
        biographers note that, despite his fears, the president&#146;s positive 
        actions were important to the outcome. As the biographer Doris Kearns 
        Goodwin said, &quot;Here was a case where the exercise of talent joined 
        with personality and opportunity to produce a brilliant display of leadership 
        and political skill.&quot;10 The historian Robert Dallek had high praise 
        as well, describing Johnson as an inspiration to the country:</font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His public appearances, 
            his use of language, his management of the press promoted feelings 
            of continuity and unity. To be sure, traditions of political stability 
            and shared assumptions about cooperative efforts to advance the national 
            well-being eased Johnson&#146;s burden. But an almost uncanny feel 
            for the appropriate word and gesture honed by thirty-two years in 
            the political arena were as important in making him equal to the task.11</font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Johnson took specific 
        actions as well. He declared a national day of mourning so the nation 
        could gather strength from spiritual, family, or community sources. In 
        a very practical way, he gathered his own resources. Though the cabinet 
        officers of a previous president traditionally resign, in a meeting with 
        Kennedy&#146;s cabinet at the White House on November 23, Johnson asked 
        them to stay on, telling them, &quot;I need you.&quot; He also had another 
        concern. He believed it was important to give the American people an answer 
        to the questions everyone was asking: Who was behind the murder of Kennedy 
        and why had he been killed? Yes, Lee Harvey Oswald had been arrested as 
        the alleged assassin, but Oswald had been shot in Dallas by a nightclub 
        operator, Jack Ruby, a few days later. Had there been a conspiracy? Who 
        was to blame? Johnson appointed a bipartisan panel to investigate the 
        death, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Though the findings of the <i>Warren 
        Commission Report&#150;</i>that Oswald and Ruby both acted alone&#150;have 
        been disputed and debated since its release, Johnson&#146;s initial efforts 
        to discover the motives for the assassination allayed people&#146;s fears.12</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On November 27, President 
        Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress from the podium of the House. 
        In his televised remarks, both the Congress and the people of the nation 
        heard him deliver a masterful speech. He told them, &quot;All I have I 
        would have gladly given not to be standing here today. The greatest leader 
        of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time. . . 
        . An assassin&#146;s bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the 
        presidency.&quot; Johnson invoked the memory of Kennedy and linked that 
        solidly to his hopes for the country he now led, saying:</font></p>

            days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in 
            our lifetime on this planet.&#146; But, he said, &#145;let us begin.&#146;
