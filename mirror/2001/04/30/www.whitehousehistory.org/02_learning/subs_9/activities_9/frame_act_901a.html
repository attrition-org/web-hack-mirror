              is defined as &quot;incitement of discontent or rebellion against 
              a government.&quot; In 1798, the Federalist-dominated Congress and 
              President John Adams passed the Sedition Act. Keep in mind that 
              at the time the United States was in an undeclared naval war with 
              France and the Federalists claimed that certain pro-French citizens

                      related to the undeclared war between the United States

                      and in what ways did the Republicans protest Federalist 
                      policy in that undeclared war? Did they do anything other 
                      than write about it? By French consular estimates, there 
                      were 25,000 French refugees in the United States in 1798. 
                      Some were aristocrats who had fled for their lives, but 
                      most were avowed revolutionaries who wished to stand in

                  times? Should the president of the United States get special 
                  privileges in the matter of public criticism? Would suppressing 
                  criticism of the president stop strong political views from 
                  forming? Can you think of any way words that when spoken against

                  to a free state? One principle that has been applied by the 
                  Supreme Court in decisions affecting free speech is based on 
                  the concept that the truth will emerge in what is referred to 
                  as &quot;the marketplace of ideas.&quot; In other words, good 
                  ideas will eventually prevail if there is free and unfettered 
                  discussion.3 Do you agree that there is a value in giving expression
