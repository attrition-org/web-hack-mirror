                    would find him guilty of impeachable offenses and the Senate 
                    would convict him of those charges. Though he resigned to 
                    avoid this &quot;official&quot; fate, he was still liable

              Now you will have an opportunity to read the transcript of the first 
              press conference conducted by President Ford after pardoning Nixon. 
              Keep in mind that presidents have been holding formal press conferences 
              at the White House since the time of Woodrow Wilson. Reporters and 
              other media commentators, representing the various news services 
              and agencies, are able to ask the president questions. Though being 
              barraged with questions can be unnerving for the president, press 
              conferences have continued because the chief executive finds them 
              helpful. They give him an opportunity to explain himself and his 
              policies; they are the closest the president comes to &quot;having 
              a conversation with the people.&quot; They also give him an opportunity 
              to discover the concerns of the American people.</font></p>

              on four articles of impeachment relating to the Paula Jones and 
              Monica Lewinsky scandals, including perjury in the grand jury hearing. 
              Clinton was impeached, tried by the Senate on two of those charges,

              1999), see if writers seem concerned that the credibility and reputation 
              of the United States government will suffer permanently because 
              of the Clinton scandals. Cut out and summarize at least three articles
