                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1.&#9;This 
                  president &quot;went on foot to the Capitol at noon, read his 
                  inaugural address in the crowded Senate chamber, and returned 
                  to the tavern&quot; where he would continue living for another 
                  fifteen days before moving into the White House. Though a man 
                  who loved houses and their planning, &quot;he wasn&#146;t so 
                  concerned about how it [the White House] looked, but rather 
                  what it symbolized about his political views.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2.&#9;When 
                  this couple moved into the White House, they couldn&#146;t have 
                  realized they would be the only president and first lady <i>driven</i> 
                  from the house by enemies of the republic. He was short, &quot;shriveled 
                  and pale&quot;&#150;no bigger than &quot;a half a piece of soap&quot; 
                  someone had said. She was &quot;tall, buxom, and rosy&quot; 
                  and had distinguished herself as a wonderful White House hostess.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">3.&#9;Viewing 
                  himself as a people&#146;s president, this recently widowed 
                  war hero insisted that the people be invited to an inaugural 
                  &quot;levee.&quot; The people came, crowding into the White 
                  House to partake of &quot;lemonade and orange punch . . . flavored 
                  heavily with whiskey.&quot; One eyewitness noticed that the 
                  crowd turned into a mob, &quot;scrambling, fighting, romping.&quot; 
                  The crowd was too much for the president. Gasping for air, he 
                  had to retreat, escaping through a window back to the hotel 
                  where he was temporarily staying. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">4.&#9;This 
                  president had auspicious beginnings: &quot;On March 4, astride 
                  a magnificent white charger, he rode to his inauguration at 
                  the Capitol, amid marching militias, floats laden with log cabins, 
                  maidens in white carrying garlands and signs with slogans, and 
                  a crowd estimated to be second only to that which had attended 
                  the inauguration of Washington.&quot; Exactly one month later, 
                  this president would be dead.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">5.&#9;This 
                  man was the idol of the nation, yet just ten years previous 
                  he had been an obscure citizen of a small town, and a failure 
                  at almost every business enterprise he had tried. He was forty-six, 
                  and rather small in stature, yet he had a &quot;cocky, self-confident 
                  stance a million young men found worthy of imitation.&quot; 
                  He was an elected president of a &quot;<i>reborn</i> nation.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">6.&#9;It 
                  was the one-hundreth anniversary of American independence, but 
                  &quot;it was darkened with controversy.&quot; Election day had 
                  come and gone and no one agreed on whether the Republican or 
                  Democrat had won. The disputed count had to be decided by an 
                  Electoral Commission. The new president heard the news on March 
                  2. However, he had an extra day to get to Washington. Since 
                  March 4<sup> </sup>fell on Sunday, the inauguration didn&#146;t 
                  take place until Monday!</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">7.&#9;He 
                  was the last veteran of the Civil War to hold the office of 
                  president. Described as &quot;tall, gentle, patient, and courtly,&quot; 
                  he was twice elected by the people. Once he had been governor 
                  of Ohio and had won his first term in part measure because of 
                  an unusually able manager, Mark Hannah. The president&#146;s 
                  wife was frail, tiny, and she had epilepsy. If at a social gathering, 
                  she had a seizure, he simply covered her face with a handkerchief 
                  until she recovered. When she moved from the White House, it 
                  was in a widow&#146;s veil.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">8.&#9;This 
                  scholarly and intellectual president had been the governor of 
                  an eastern, pivotal state. At the podium on Inauguration Day, 
                  he looked out to see the people who had come to hear him being 
                  held behind a police barricade. &quot;Let the people come forward,&quot; 
                  he had exclaimed dramatically. His wife left her seat on the 
                  platform and walked down to join the crowd at the base of the 
                  steps, the better to see her husband as he gave his inaugural 
                  address. Though he would be elected to another term, it would 
                  be his second wife who would hold the Bible at the second swearing-in.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">9.&#9;Ike 
                  Hoover, the chief usher at the White House, had said, &quot;Republicans 
                  dropped out of sight overnight. Those who were left seemed to 
                  have changed into Democrats.&quot; It was to be that way for 
                  quite awhile. The president inaugurated that March 4, would 
                  be back to take the oath of office more than once. But the next 
                  time, the date would be January 20. When he moved into the White 
                  House, he had a pool built, and it wasn&#146;t just for recreation.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">10.&#9;Many 
                  Americans thought this man would not be elected president in 
                  his own right, and he had a dramatic headline to prove it. Despite 
                  the victory, he would not spend much of his &quot;elected&quot; 
                  term in the White House. Even though he savored the unexpected 
                  victory, he and his family would live most of those four years 
                  in Blair House across the street. When the leg of his daughter&#146;s 
                  grand piano sank into the floor, causing the ceiling of the 
                  private dining room below to fall, all agreed the White House 
                  needed a major renovation. </font></p>
