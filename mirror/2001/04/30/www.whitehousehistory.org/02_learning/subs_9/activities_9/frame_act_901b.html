              way you learn about historical events is to talk to the people who 
              experienced them. Many people remember vividly the assassination 
              of John F. Kennedy in 1963. Personal memories provide a perspective 
              that is different from the accounts you read in textbooks; it helps 
              you understand the impact of an event on ordinary people. At the 
              time you study the transition of Lyndon Johnson to the presidency 
              after the death of John F. Kennedy, arrange to interview a person 
              who remembers it personally. </font></p>

                  information, write your partner a letter explaining similarities 
                  and differences between the two interviews. Read your responses 
                  aloud to the class. After the class has completed the sharing,

                  in of Lyndon Johnson; the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald and his

              <br>
              Most Americans would agree that one major factor in Jimmy Carter&#146;s 
              loss of a re-election bid in 1980 had to do with his handling of 
              the Iranian hostage crisis. Your Student Text recounts the 
              final days of Carter&#146;s presidency as he tried as a last measure 
              of his administration to secure the release of the hostages. Ronald 
              Reagan had already given his inaugural address when word came that, 
              finally, the hostages had been released. The new president invited 
              Carter to go to Weisbaden, West Germany, where the hostages were 
              resting and preparing for their return to the United States, and 
              welcome them. The former president had fervently hoped that he would 
              be able to make this trip before the end of his term, but it wasn&#146;t 
              possible. Now, at last, he could greet these freed hostages who 
              had been held during 444 long days of his presidency. Yet Hamilton 
              Jordan, Carter&#146;s chief of staff, explains in <i>Crisis</i> 
              that, when the president arrived, Sheldon Krys, the State Department 
              official who had been responsible throughout the crisis for liaison 
              with the hostages, gave him a warning:</font></p>

                  President, there is a good bit of hostility among the group 
                  toward you. One of the former hostages has even refused to attend 
                  this meeting. These people have basically been told over and 
                  over, &quot;The U.S. doesn&#146;t care about you, and Carter 
                  doesn&#146;t care about you, and nothing has been done to win 
                  your release.&quot; They have almost no sense of what we did 
                  to get them out and no sense of the feeling of the American 
                  people toward them.4</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
              Carter did see the former hostages, he gave them an opportunity 
              to ask questions, after first telling them, &quot;I take full responsibility 
              for the decisions made by my government.&quot; Jordan explained 
              that &quot;the first man stepped forward in a trembling angry voice 
              and said, &#145;Mr. President, why did you let the Shah into the 
              states when the embassy advised against it?&#146;&quot; President 
              Carter offered his rationale. Then, another man stepped forward 
              and said, &quot;Why did you attempt the rescue mission?&quot; Again,

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Using 
              the interview procedure ideas in Part I of this activity, arrange 
              to interview at least two Americans who are old enough to remember 
              the Iranian hostage crisis, preferably of different backgrounds 
              and ages. To establish a context for their responses, ask them to 
              answer some general questions:</font></p>

                  is the 258<sup>th</sup> day of the Iranian hostage crisis.&quot;]?

              other class members have finished their interviews, work in groups 
              of five or six to compile the results into an Opinion Grid<i>. </i> 
              Using a large piece of butcher paper, write the last six questions 
              of the interview across the top of the paper, and make a grid to 
              hold five answers for each question underneath. Paraphrase each 
              interviewee&#146;s responses onto the sheet for all six questions. 
              Look over the grid, and mark through duplicate answers. To further 
              cull the interview responses, repeat this process with other groups 
              in the classroom. When all of the opinions of the interviewees have 
              been culled, analyze the results and make some generalizations. 
              Would this group of interviewees have been among those who gave 
              Carter only a 20 percent approval rating in 1980, or were the results 
              different? Did the interviewees&#146; responses to the last question 
              reflect a change in their opinion about Carter? If so, why do you 
              think they changed their mind?</font></p>

              a follow-up, read from either Hamilton Jordan&#146;s <i>Crisis</i>, 
              or President Carter&#146;s <i>Keeping Faith</i>, Carter&#146;s rationales 
              for deciding to admit the shah and approving a military rescue of 
              the hostages. Share this information with the classmates, and ask 
              them if Carter&#146;s steps seemed reasonable. How do they think 
              the hostages would have viewed Carter&#146;s efforts to rescue them?<br>
