            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He seemed a 
              contented man. House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford, had his niche. 
              He had served twelve terms as a congressman, never receiving less 
              than 60 percent of the vote from his constituents back in Grand 
              Rapids, Michigan. Ford did not hunger to be president of the United 
              States. As he once said, &quot;When I first ran for the Congress 
              I had an ambition to be a good legislator, and when I got to Washington 
              as a member of the House . . . to be a <i>very good</i> legislator.&quot;1 
              One last ambition, a chance to be Speaker of the House toward the 
              end of his career, was thwarted when the Republicans didn&#146;t 
              win a majority in the House. Nevertheless, he believed he had served 
              his home district well, and, as he told his wife Betty, he would 
              retire from a very satisfying public career by January 1977. Yet 
              a chain of political events was about to take his life in a direction 
              he could never have imagined.</font></p>

                    to Ford, the first link in the chain was the infamous Watergate 
                    break-in. Early on the morning of June 17, 1972, five Cubans 
                    were caught in a burglary at the Democratic National Committee 
                    headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington; 
                    two others had been arrested not long afterwards and charged 
                    with supervising the break-in. At first it seemed &quot;penny-ante,&quot; 
                    but when two reporters from the <i>Washington Post</i> began 
                    to investigate they discovered that among those involved in 
                    the burglary were former employees of the Committee to Re-Elect 
                    the President (soon popularly called CREEP). At least one 
                    of them worked in the White House itself. In addition, they 
                    had been paid for the break-in from a secret fund of the reelection 
                    committee, controlled by staff members at the White House. 
                    Public interest in the disclosures was not great in the beginning, 
                    and few questioned President Richard M. Nixon when he said 
                    that neither he nor his staff had anything to do with &quot;this 
                    very bizarre incident.&quot; 2 Nixon sailed through his bid 
                    for re-election. His opponent, Democrat George McGovern, won 
                    the electoral votes of only Massachusetts and the District 
                    of Columbia.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Early in 1973, however, 
        the Watergate burglars went on trial, and under unyielding prodding from 
        federal judge John Sirica, one of the defendants, James W. McCord, agreed 
        to cooperate with both the grand jury and a special Senate investigating 
        committee.3 McCord&#146;s testimony resulted in a torrent of admissions, 
        and for months a procession of White House and campaign officials exposed 
        questionable or illegal actions. One of those was a member of the president&#146;s 
        inner circle, White House counsel John Dean. Dean leveled charges against 
        President Nixon himself. It seemed clear that there had been abuses of 
        power involving both the White House staff and the Nixon campaign committee. 
        There were the White House &quot;plumbers,&quot; under the direction of 
        John Ehrlichman, whose mission had been to investigate and harass political 
        opponents through illegal wiretaps, intercepted mail, and burglaries.4 
        Illegal campaign contributions had been &quot;laundered&quot; in Mexico 
        and used to support a variety of &quot;dirty tricks&quot; against Democratic 
        presidential candidates and to pay for other activities aimed at sabotaging 
        the campaigns of Nixon&#146;s opponents. Then there was the Watergate 
        break-in itself. Part of a million dollar security and intelligence-gathering 
        plan called Operation Gemstone<i>, </i>some claimed it had been initiated 
        by Dean, while others placed the blame on Attorney General John Mitchell.5 
        Though it seemed clear that Nixon neither planned nor approved the burglary 
        in advance, there was more and more evidence that he had been involved 
        to some degree in a cover-up, although after the fact.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;No 
        Contest&quot;</font></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, Nixon&#146;s 
        vice president, Spiro Agnew, had his own problems. He was accused of having 
        accepted bribes and kickbacks while governor of Maryland. In exchange 
        for an agreement on the part of the Justice Department not to further 
        prosecute the case, he plea-bargained, admitting &quot;nolo contendere&quot; 
        (no contest) to a lesser charge. Shortly thereafter, he resigned. 6 Gerald 
        Ford explained how he heard about the decision that would change his life. 
        About two days before the Agnew story broke, Nixon invited him to come 
        down to the Executive Office Building for a talk. He had known Nixon since 
        January 1949, when Nixon, then a congressman, had welcomed him as a &quot;freshman&quot; 
        representative from Grand Rapids to the House. Now, during a ninety-minute 
        conversation, they reminisced about their long friendship, mutual friends, 
        and goals they&#146;d shared within their party over the years. Ford got 
        a phone call telling him to get back to the House floor for a roll-call 
        vote. As he arrived, two of his House colleagues grabbed him by the arm 
        and said, &quot;Agnew&#146;s resigning!&quot; Then Ford understood the 
        timeliness of his visit to the president. Nixon was considering him as 
        the next vice president.7</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With an overflow 
        crowd of cabinet members, the leaders and committee powers of Congress, 
        White House staff, and prime-time television networks, Nixon nominated 
        Gerald R. Ford as vice president of the United States at the White House 
        on October 12, 1973. Ford was the first person to be nominated under the 
        Twenty-Fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, which, among other things, provided 
        for filling vacancies in the vice presidency. After a reception at the 
        White House, the Fords left for their home across the Potomac River in 
        Alexandria, Virginia&#150;under guard by the Secret Service for the first 
        time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        Saturday Night Massacre</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, the White 
        House scandal became even more heated. Alexander Butterfield, a White 
        House staffer, offered Senate Watergate Committee investigators an important 
        piece of information. There was a tape-recording device in all four offices 
        the president used, including the White House Oval Office. Almost every 
        conversation between the president and his staff that had taken place 
        during the time after the Watergate break-in had been recorded! 8 All 
        those investigating the scandals wanted to listen to the tapes, but Nixon 
        refused, saying that action would compromise his right to the confidentiality 
        of conversations in his office, a claim known as &quot;executive privilege.&quot; 
        When the Justice Department&#146;s special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, 
        went to court to force the evidence, Nixon ordered his attorney general, 
        Elliot Richardson, to fire Cox. Richardson refused to do so, and resigned 
        in protest; the deputy attorney general refused as well, and was dismissed 
        before he could resign. Finally, another official in the Justice Department, 
        Robert Bork, agreed to carry out the firing. The so-called Saturday Night 
        Massacre released a fire storm of protest, with nearly a half million 
        telegrams bombarding the White House in one week. Furthermore, when Speaker 
        Carl Albert called the House of Representatives to order on the Tuesday 
        morning after the firings, a score of them were waiting in line to introduce 
        resolutions of impeachment of the president of the United States. Under 
        the hail of public protest, Nixon yielded nine tapes.9</font></p>

        New Precedents</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As the House and 
        Senate prepared the confirmation hearings that would make Gerald Ford 
        vice president, they understood that they had an awesome responsibility 
        in front of them. According to the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, the appointment 
        had to be confirmed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses. Members of confirmation 
        committees on both sides of the Congress knew they were establishing precedents. 
        For the first time in the history of the republic, a vice president of 
        the United States would be confirmed by the 535 members of the U.S. Congress, 
        not the vote of the Electoral College, whose decisions reflected the popular 
        election. In a sense, Congress had been asked to act as the Electoral 
        College. In letting his committee know the import of the task, the chairman 
        of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Howard Cannon said, 
        &quot;It is for the members of this committee to establish a precedent&#150;a 
        solid, Constitutional precedent&#150;by pursuing an orderly, logical, 
        thorough, and honest inquiry into the nominee&#146;s qualifications.&quot;10</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the politically 
        charged environment of Watergate and the Agnew scandal, Gerald Ford, too, 
        wanted Congress to have no doubts about his qualifications. He told his 
        advisors, &quot;Hold nothing back,&quot; and, according to historian James 
        Cannon, &quot;directed his lawyer, his accountant, his banker, his doctor, 
        his peers in the House, his personal friends, and his brothers to put 
        everything on the record.&quot;11 At the end of the investigation, the 
        FBI had interviewed more than a thousand people, producing a report of 
        1,700 single-spaced pages. In accepting their responsibility for choosing 
        someone for the vice presidency, the congressional committee members collected 
        more information about a public official than had ever been known about 
        any person in or out of American public office.12 Ford was confirmed. 
        Even then, many on Capitol Hill understood that they had chosen not only 
        the vice president, but perhaps the future president as well. On December 
        6, 1973, Ford took the oath of office in the House chamber, using a Bible 
        given to him by his oldest son, while his wife looked on. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">An 
        Accelerating Crisis</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By early 1974, the 
        Watergate crisis had come to a full boil. In April, a federal grand jury 
        indicted Nixon&#146;s former attorney general, John Mitchell, along with 
        the president&#146;s top aides, John Ehrlichman, and H. R. Haldeman, plus 
        others in high positions in the Nixon administration. Nixon himself was 
        named as a &quot;co-conspirator.&quot; Then both the House Judiciary Committee 
        and the new federal prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, subpoenaed more tapes. 
        In an effort to head off still more subpoenas, the president released 
        a 1,308-page transcript of certain edited tapes, saying these tapes proved 
        his innocence. The reaction seemed worse than had come after the Saturday 
        Night Massacre. Even with many expletives deleted, the public was stunned 
        at the &quot;insider&quot; view the tapes revealed. The writers of <i>The 
        National Experience</i> declared that the tapes displayed Nixon as a profane 
        man, seemingly &quot;mean-spirited, and amoral.&quot;13 The furor over 
        the release of the tapes nearly eclipsed an announcement by the president&#146;s 
        senior defense lawyer, James D. St. Clair, that Nixon would <i>not</i> 
        hand over the tapes and documents that Judge Sirica had subpoenaed.14 
        The president appealed this subpoena, eventually to the Supreme Court, 
        saying it was within his power as president to withhold the tapes. The 
        demand for Nixon&#146;s impeachment rose to a new level.</font></p>

        Court ruled unanimously, in the <i>United States v. Richard M. Nixon,</i> 
        that the president had to relinquish all of the White House tapes&#150;sixty-four 
        in all&#150;to the special prosecutor. Nixon&#146;s attorneys advised 
        him that if he didn&#146;t give over the tapes, any support he had in 
        Congress would be gone; impeachment would be assured. Nixon knew that 
        impeachment most likely was assured anyway. For unlike his attorneys, 
        the president knew exactly what the tapes would reveal, especially one 
        from a June 23, 1972, meeting, only six days after the Watergate break-in. 
        He knew that when the prosecutor heard that tape, the one in which he 
        agreed to use the Central Intelligence Agency to stop the Federal Bureau 
        of Investigation probe of the Watergate break-in, he would be clearly 
        implicated in the cover up. Nixon asked his legal counsel to listen to 
        that tape, and assess its legal implications. When Nixon&#146;s attorney, 
        Fred Buzhardt, heard the tape, he called Alexander Haig, the president&#146;s 
        chief of staff, and said, &quot;Well, we&#146;ve found the smoking pistol!&quot;15 
        Still another of the president&#146;s defense attorneys, James St. Clair, 
        read a transcript of the tape. When Haig called St. Clair and asked him 
        how damaging it was to Nixon, he answered in one word, &quot;Fatal.&quot;16</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A few days after 
        the Supreme Court decision, after weeks of hearings, the House Judiciary 
        Committee voted three articles of impeachment, charging Nixon with obstruction 
        of justice in the Watergate case, with violating the rights of certain 
        citizens with regard to the administration of justice, and with unconstitutionally 
        denying the Committee&#146;s subpoenas. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since Gerald Ford 
        had become vice president, he had walked a very uncomfortable line. In 
        private he disagreed with some of the actions that he knew had been taken 
        by the Nixon White House. Ford believed that Nixon had always been truthful 
        with him, and Nixon had denied any wrongdoing in this matter. For a while 
        Ford simply thought the president was getting some very bad advice. Though 
        as time went by, he had more and more suspicions that Nixon was involved 
        in the Watergate cover up, he still held onto the idea that legal and 
        congressional processes would make the judgment. Furthermore, as he said, 
        &quot;It was a very narrow path for nine months. If I was critical of 
        Nixon, the press and the public would have said, well, he was trying to 
        undercut Nixon so he will get the job. On the other hand, if I stayed 
        too loyal it might appear that I was supporting somebody who was involved 
        in this very unwise action. . . . It was not a pleasant experience.&quot;17</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Be ready for 
        a change in your life.&quot; That was Alexander Haig&#146;s advice to 
        Gerald Ford on August 1, when he talked with him the first time about 
        the &quot;smoking gun.&quot; He outlined what White House lawyers saw 
        as the president&#146;s options in the wake of the damaging tapes, mentioning, 
        for example, that Nixon could actually pardon himself and resign. Then, 
        as Ford remembered it, &quot;Finally, Haig said that according to some 
        on Nixon&#146;s White House staff, Nixon could agree to leave in return 
        for an agreement that the new president&#150;Gerald Ford&#150;would pardon 
        him.&quot; Ford listened to all of the suggested options, including that 
        one, but as he said, &quot;I did not urge Haig to do anything to get Nixon 
        to resign. That was <i>his </i>choice.&quot;18 Perhaps it was, but Ford&#146;s 
        close personal advisor, Bryce Harlow, told the vice president that if 
        he became president, &quot;There must not be any cause for anyone to cry 
        &#145;deal&#146; if you have to make that decision [a pardon], or any 
        mystery about your position now that you know what Haig . . . [has] told 
        you.&quot;19 Harlow&#146;s reasoning weighed on Ford. Thinking back on 
        his conversations with Haig, and the implications suggested by other advisors 
        as well as Harlow, Ford decided he needed to clarify with Nixon&#146;s 
        chief of staff exactly what his position was. The next day, he called 
        Haig at the White House. To be sure his message would be clear, he had 
        written it out, and read it to the chief of staff over the phone: &quot;I 
        want you to understand that I have no intention of recommending what the 
        president should do about resigning or not resigning, and that nothing 
        we talked about yesterday afternoon should be given any consideration 
        in whatever decision the president may wish to make.&quot; Haig&#146;s 
        reply: &quot;You&#146;re absolutely right.&quot;20</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At 4:00 p.m. on August 
        5, 1974, the White House released the transcript of the June 23<sup> </sup>tape, 
        along with a 1,000-word statement by Nixon attempting to justify his actions 
        in the Watergate cover-up. Despite the explanation, Nixon understood that 
        once the transcript became public, he could not escape the anger throughout 
        the land. Moreover, an important Republican leader, Senator Barry Goldwater, 
        had given him the count. In the Senate, Nixon had just six senators who 
        would vote against an impeachment conviction. As Goldwater said, &quot;It&#146;s 
        finished.&quot; On the morning of August 6, Nixon met with his cabinet, 
        and in an atmosphere that seemed surreal, tried to conduct business as 
        usual. George Bush, in attendance as the chairman of the Republican National 
        Committee, could not bear to hear a mundane discussion of inflation problems 
        continue, as if it were a normal meeting. Raising his hand, he stated 
        bluntly, &quot;Mr. President, you<i> have </i>to resign.&quot;21 It hit 
        like a ton of bricks. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Transitions</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> By mid-afternoon, 
        Tuesday, August 6, 1974, President Nixon had made the decision that he 
        would resign. At 3:30 p.m. he picked up a yellow legal pad and wrote &quot;Resignation 
        Speech&quot; on top, then made several pages of notes to give his speechwriter, 
        who would draft his final speech.22 That Thursday, August 8, Ford was 
        summoned to the White House to see the president. When Ford was seated, 
        he recalled that Nixon came right to the point, &quot;I have made a decision 
        to resign. It&#146;s in the best interest of the country. I won&#146;t 
        go into the pros and cons of it, I&#146;ve made my decision.&quot; Ford 
        related that he told the president he was ready to do the job, and Nixon 
        agreed. After that, according to Ford, the president relaxed, and talked 
        about the problems Ford would face in economic and foreign affairs, mentioning 
        nothing about Watergate or the possibility of a pardon. Nixon made practical 
        suggestions, including reminding Ford that he would be nominating a vice 
        president. &quot;It&#146;s your choice,&quot; he had told him, but mentioned 
        Nelson Rockefeller as &quot;a good man.&quot;23</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then Nixon switched 
        the conversation to the protocol of transitions, even this one. He had 
        a plan well in mind. He and his family would go to the East Room to say 
        good-bye to the staff and the cabinet. After that, they would walk directly 
        through the diplomatic entrance of the White House to the helicopter. 
        From Andrews Air Force Base they would fly in <i>Air Force One</i> for 
        San Clemente, their home. Nixon suggested that the Fords walk with them 
        to the helicopter. The president wanted to know where Ford planned to 
        be sworn in. Ford said he had decided not to go to Capitol Hill&#150;it 
        might seem too much like a celebration. Nixon told him he could be sworn 
        in at the White House. &quot;I&#146;ll be gone before noon,&quot; he said.24<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At 12:03 p.m. on 
        August 9, 1974, in the East Room of the White House, Gerald R. Ford took 
        the oath of office as president. His remarks reflected his understanding 
        of how he came to be president: &quot;I am acutely aware that you have 
        not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to 
        confirm me as your President with your prayers.&quot; Another memorable 
        line from the speech expressed his hope for the country: &quot;My fellow 
        Americans, our long national nightmare is over.&quot;25 President Ford&#146;s 
        task was straightforward: he had to relieve the anger and anxiety in the 
        country and to give Americans a sense that a decent, respectable person 
        was in the White House. For almost a month he did just that. There was 
        an almost palpable sigh of relief, with Ford&#146;s approval rating reaching 
        70 percent. Complying with the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, Ford nominated 
        New York governor, Nelson Rockefeller, for vice president. For the first 
        time in history both the president and vice president had come to office 
        and power not like all other predecessors, through election, but through 
        appointment and confirmation. Most people seemed able to accept that unusual 
        circumstance of the Ford administration. Yet when he made the decision 
        to pardon Nixon, it would be a different matter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fall-Out</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Thirty days after 
        President Ford took office, on Sunday, September 8, he gave Richard Nixon 
        and &quot;full, free, and absolute pardon for all Watergate crimes.&quot; 
        When Ford had broached the subject with his staff only a week or so before, 
        he had described his rationale: &quot; The degrading spectacle of a former 
        President in a prisoner&#146;s dock&#146;; the near impossibility of finding 
        an open-minded jury anywhere in the country; the press stories about every 
        step in the process that would revive &#145;the whole rotten mess of Watergate.&#146;&quot; 
        Even if Nixon was tried, in the end, he might be found innocent; or even 
        if not, perhaps a future president would pardon him after all the tumult.26 
        Ford defended his pardon decision vigorously, especially accusations that 
        he had made a &quot;deal&quot; for the presidency, even appearing before 
        a congressional committee to explain it. Yet his action caused a decline 
        in his initial popularity from which he never fully recovered. Ford made 
        a bid for the presidency in his own right in 1976, but was defeated in 
        a close election with Jimmy Carter. In the wake of the Watergate scandal, 
        Carter presented himself as an outsider &quot;who had not been involved 
        in any way with Washington.&quot; The republic dusted itself off, and 
        took a new direction.<br>
