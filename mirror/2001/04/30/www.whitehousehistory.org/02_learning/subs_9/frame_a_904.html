              of his office, a president holds enormous power to bring changes, 
              both subtle and dramatic, in the nation he governs. Certain leaders 
              of the civil rights movement understood that by using organized 
              mass pressure they could tap this source of executive power to accomplish 
              goals. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><i>Part 
              A: President Franklin D. Roosevelt, A. Philip Randolph, and the 
              Desegregation of the Defense Industries. </i></font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Among civil 
              rights leaders, perhaps no one recognized this potent presidential 
              power more than Asa Philip Randolph. In 1940, this dignified, tall, 
              fifty-one-year-old man was at the pinnacle of his career as a national 
              labor organizer. As the president of the all-black Brotherhood of 
              Sleeping Car Porters, he had a complaint with the federal government. 
              War was raging in Europe, and it seemed inevitable that the United 
              States would be drawn into it. To provide the resources needed by 
              the beleaguered British and to prepare the United States for possible 
              involvement in the war, the nation had begun to rearm. After years 
              of depression, employment figures were up, as huge defense contracts 
              created new jobs. But not for black Americans, for the defense industry 
              was thoroughly segregated. So were the armed services. When a meeting 
              with President Franklin D. Roosevelt to address these problems yielded 
              no results, Randolph threatened to bring 100,000 black workers to 
              the capital for a &quot;March on Washington&quot; as a means of 
              calling attention to these injustices. Randolph, who had scheduled 
              the march for July 1, 1941, refused to back down without substantial 
              gains, and Roosevelt was forced to act. Using his power to issue 
              executive orders, the president desegregated the defense industry 
              and the civilian federal government by a single stroke of a pen. 
              Furthermore, Executive Order 8802 created the Fair Employment Practices 
              Committee<i> </i>to investigate reported cases of discrimination. 
              Though Randolph called off the march, the organizational structure 
              for a planned March on Washington was not disbanded, just put on 
              hold for another time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><i>Part 
              B: President Harry S. Truman, A. Philip Randolph, and the Desegregation 
              of the Armed Services</i></font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Despite the 
              fact that blacks were hired in defense industries during World War 
              II, the armed services were not desegregated. The legal separation 
              of blacks through so-called Jim Crow laws affected not only civilians 
              but servicemen as well. Blacks continued to be taken into the service 
              under a limited quota system, and although they sometimes trained 
              with white troops, they rode Jim Crow trains and lived in segregated 
              barracks.1 Since the end of World War II, A. Philip Randolph had 
              been seeking ways to pressure the federal government to end discrimination 
              in the armed forces. A study released in 1946 revealed that little 
              was being done to change the segregated status of blacks in the 
              military. In late 1947, Truman had requested passage of a program 
              called Universal Military Training, a preparedness approach that 
              required every young man between the ages of eighteen and twenty 
              to be trained for one year as a reserve force. These units could 
              be called to active duty in the event that the cold war turned &quot;hot.&quot; 
              Though it was unlikely that Congress would enact this program, it 
              seemed certain that some kind of draft legislation would be forthcoming. 
              Truman had given a strong civil rights message to Congress in February 
              1948 but black leaders saw little evidence that he was backing his 
              words with action. When the president made a strong appeal in early 
              March for Universal Military Training and a Selective Service Act 
              (or draft), he made no mention of changing segregated conditions 
              in the military. Though Truman had said he wanted to rid the armed 
              services of discrimination, a strong desegregation clause had been 
              deleted from the Selective Service Act at the request of the army. 
              In a White House meeting with Truman shortly thereafter, Randolph 
              let it be known that the passage of a &quot;Jim Crow&quot; draft 
              would cause an uproar among blacks. &quot;Negroes are in no mood 
              to shoulder a gun for democracy abroad so long as they are denied 
              democracy here at home,&quot; he told the president.2 Truman was 
              outraged, calling Randolph&#146;s statement a threat and &quot;treason.&quot; 
              Randolph continued his pressure. Testifying before the Senate Armed 
              Services Committee, he stated, &quot;I personally will advise Negroes 
              to refuse to fight as slaves for a democracy they cannot possess 
              and . . . enjoy.&quot;3 The response, even from liberal senators, 
              was disheartening. Randolph came to believe that only Truman could 
              set the &quot;moral pace&quot; and end segregation. Continued application 
              of pressure had its effects. It would not look good for a nation 
              that was supposed to be the &quot;bulwark of democracy&quot; against 
              communist tyranny to have a million black Americans refuse military 
              service. On July 26, 1948, President Truman signed Executive Order 
              9981 desegregating the military. Still believing the order to be 
              ambiguous, Randolph insisted on meetings to clarify its language 
              and gain a strong commitment for follow-through. On August 18, 1948, 
              A. Philip Randolph called off the campaign of civil disobedience.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><i>Part 
              C: President John F. Kennedy, A. Philip Randolph, and the March 
              on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</i></font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By 1963, a 
              surging civil rights movement was gaining great momentum. Spurred 
              by the Supreme Court ruling of <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, 
              dramatized through the new medium of television and led by the charismatic 
              Dr. Martin Luther King, blacks were beginning to apply massive pressure 
              to agencies of the government, demanding change. John F. Kennedy 
              was president and appalled by violence against civil rights marchers 
              in the South; he had begun to label civil rights a &quot;moral cause.&quot; 
              In June 1963, Kennedy, though still concerned about alienating southern 
              voters, had sent a civil rights bill to Congress. Black leaders 
              knew the struggle for that bill&#146;s passage would be fierce. 
              To encourage a positive vote on the bill, dramatize the need for 
              change, and impress Kennedy with the magnitude of the movement, 
              a peaceful march for &quot;jobs and freedom&quot; was planned. A. 
              Philip Randolph, who had conceived of this idea so long ago, gave 
              enormous energy to the March on Washington of August 28, 1963. A 
              man of great integrity, he was able to coalesce both the militant, 
              moderate, and conservative elements of the civil rights movement 
              to plan and execute this great event. The march, 250,000 strong, 
              provided dramatic evidence not only to the president, but also to 
              Congress, that blacks would continue to fight for racial justice. 
              Understanding the power of this &quot;massive political force&quot; 
              to press for change, Kennedy used the White House as a setting for 
              a meeting with Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr., and other black 
              leaders both before and after the march. In those Oval Office meetings, 
              two great forces of democratic power came together: the constitutional 
              authority of the president of the United States, and the leadership 
              of a popular mass movement. The successful and peaceful March on 
              Washington was &quot;a high point for those who believed that the 
              grievances of the blacks could be redressed by working within the 
              system.&quot;5 Low points were ahead for the civil rights movement, 
              both in terms of its splintering leadership and its ability to effect 
              solutions for deep social and economic problems. Yet for A. Philip 
              Randolph, the March on Washington was the fulfillment of a lifetime 
              of work and validated something he had always believed: power flows 
              from the people.<br>
