        the </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">end of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
        century, explorers had largely measured the landscape that defined the 
        American frontier. The once boundless land was now comprehensible, and 
        the natural resources that could be extracted from it were beginning to 
        be calculable. At the same time, between approximately 1880-1920, other 
        forces were working together to create the beginnings of the conservation 
        movement in America. Travel and leisure were on the rise, as was the notion 
        that America&#146;s open spaces provided an antidote to the perils of 
        city life.<br>
        <br>
        Equally important was the progressive political philosophy, personified 
        by President Theodore Roosevelt, that the federal government must take 
        an active and aggressive role in planning the wise use of natural resources.</font> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The passage of the 1906 
          Antiquities Act was a landmark in the conservation movement. It provided 
          the president of the United States with the authority, at his discretion, 
          to set aside for federal protection large tracts of land as national 
          monuments. Since 1906, presidents have used the Antiquities Act almost 
          100 times, protecting millions of acres of public land. Sometimes these 
          decisions have angered landowners, who argued that they have been left 
          out of the decision-making process and, thus, have had little control 
          over local land use issues.</font><br>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1872, Congress ordered 
          that the Yellowstone country of Wyoming and Montana be set aside "as 
          a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of 
          the people." In the next several decades, Congress created other national 
          parks, such as Yosemite and Mount Rainier. Congress was motivated by 
          two goals, which were not seen at the time as necessarily conflicting: 
          preserving nature and promoting tourism.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition to Congress, 
          presidents also participated in the effort to preserve nature. Between 
          1891 and 1901, presidents Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland and William 
          McKinley had transferred 50 million acres into forest reserves, the 
          precursor to national forests. President Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) 
          appointed Gifford Pinchot as chief of the Bureau of Forestry and followed 
          Pinchot&#146;s advice to place another 150 million acres into reserves. 
          As a young man, Roosevelt had operated a cattle ranch in the Dakota 
          Territory. His love of the outdoors combined with his political belief 
          that the federal government should be the major force behind conservation. 
          More so, he came to wield the executive authority of the presidential 
          office with great energy. In 1903, he asked, "Is there any law that 
          will prevent me from declaring Pelican Island [Florida] a Federal Bird 
          Reservation? . . . Very well, then I so declare it!" By executive order, 
          he created the first of 51 national bird sanctuaries. Not everyone was 
          pleased with what were viewed as the president&#146;s near-dictatorial 
          powers. Roosevelt claimed: "I did not usurp power, but I did greatly 
          expand the use of executive power. . . . I acted for the common well-being 
          of all our people."</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">American Indian sites came 
          to be just as endangered as nature. During the late 1800s, numerous 
          World&#146;s Fairs and museums featured exhibits on Indian life, displaying 
          artifacts dug up by archaeologists. As the demand for Indian artifacts 
          grew, Indian sites began to suffer from looting and vandalism. Teams 
          of scientists began to document the destruction and called for federal 
          protection. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1906, Congress enacted 
          the American Antiquities Act with virtually no debate and no opposition. 
          The Antiquities Act strove to protect "any historic or prehistoric ruin 
          or monument, or any object of antiquity" on federal lands, providing 
          the president with the authority to declare national monuments those 
          historic landmarks which he deemed worthy. It reflected the broader 
          shift in power from the Congress to the president - a shift that more or 
          less dominated 20<sup>th</sup>-century American politics.<b><i><font size="4"><br>

          Act of 1906</a><b> </b> or make a transparency. Discuss the background 
          of the conservation movement with your students, or have them read the 
          relevant portion of their textbooks. Have students carefully read the 
          text of the Antiquities Act of 1906. Ask them to summarize the first 
          3 sections. Discuss the following: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. How well did the Act 
          address the major concerns which prompted its passage? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. By passing the Act, Congress 
          gave the president the power to select tracts of land to be set aside 
          without getting approval from Congress, the people&#146;s representatives. 
          Why do you think Congress gave the president such authority rather than 
          keeping that power in its own hands?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. During the debate in 
          the House of Representatives on the Antiquities bill, John Stephens 
          of Texas expressed concern that the bill could potentially take huge 
          tracts of land off the market. John Lacey of Iowa, who chaired the Committee 
          on Public Lands, assured him that "not very much" land would be taken, 
          because the "bill provides that it shall be the smallest area necessary 
          for the care and maintenance of the objects to be preserved." The intent, 
          he told the Texan, was simply "to preserve these old objects of special 
          interest and the Indian remains in the pueblos in the Southwest." Just 
          three months after Congress passed the Antiquities Act, President Theodore 
          Roosevelt proclaimed Devil&#146;s Tower in Wyoming the first national 
          monument. Devil&#146;s Tower was a site of scientific rather than historical 
          interest, as was the fourth monument that he proclaimed, the Petrified 
          Forest in Arizona. Was this an abuse of his power as president? Have 
          the students look again at section 2 of the Antiquities Act.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="4"><i>Activity 
          2</i></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite the nearly unanimous 
          support that the Antiquities Act received in 1906, presidential proclamations 
          of national monuments sometimes spark heated opposition. When a president 
          creates a national monument, the extraction of coal, oil, timber, and 
          other resources in that area becomes very restricted. Some critics also 
          object that, frequently, presidents reserve much more land than is necessary 
          to protect the area, thereby reducing local economic opportunities. 
          Local landowners have sometimes complained that presidents have acted 
          without properly consulting the wishes or needs of the people who live 
          near the monuments.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Divide your students into 
          groups and assign each group a different national monument to research. 
          You could have them research national monuments near where you live 
          (most of the monuments are in the western half of the country, but there 
          are a few in the east). Alternatively, you could ask them to research 
          some of the more controversial monuments, such as Grand Staircase-Escalante 
          in Utah and Jackson Hole in Wyoming (the latter turned into a tug of 
          war between the president and Congress). A complete list of the monuments 
          created by each president is available on the National Park Service&#146;s 
          web site at <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/antiq.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/antiq.htm</a>. 
          Your students can also find out more about each monument elsewhere on 
          the NPS site. Each group should research the circumstances of the monument&#146;s 
          creation, including whether there was any opposition to it, why it was 
          proclaimed a monument, and how many acres or square miles the proclamation 
          encompassed. Have students write a brief history of a National Park 
          or national monument or create a poster or exhibit depicting the monument&#146;s 
          history.<br>
          <br>
          Artists and photographers left behind many images of the open spaces 
          in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Students will find these 
          useful for illustrating their projects. Explorers such as John Muir 
          also left behind excellent eyewitness accounts. See also the bibliography

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A White House Conference</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In May 1908, President Theodore 
          Roosevelt sponsored a three-day conference of governors at the White 
          House. For the first time in American history, representatives from 
          the states met together to discuss the nation&#146;s natural resources. 
          The White House Conference on Conservation has been called "a seminal 
          event in the history" of the conservation movement. One of the results 
          of the meeting was the creation of the National Conservation Commission, 
          a group of state and federal representatives who sought to calculate 
          the nation&#146;s natural resources and make recommendations for their 
          future use. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After the National Conservation 
          Commission met, it submitted a report. President Roosevelt wrote a message 
          to Congress that introduced the report. This message summarized the 
          findings and recommended actions to conserve water, forests, land and 
          minerals. But the message also gave Roosevelt a chance to use his "bully 
          pulpit." The message is dated January 22, 1909, less than two months 
          before he would step aside for a new president. Roosevelt took the opportunity 
          to summarize the good deeds of his progressive administration. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To find the message go to 
          the Library of Congress&#146; on-line exhibit, "The Evolution of the 
          Conservation Movement, 1850-1920." You will find it at <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html" target="_blank">http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html</a>. 
          Search for "Report of the National Conservation Commission." You will 
          find Roosevelt&#146;s message near the beginning of the report. Have 
          students read the message and make a list of the accomplishments that 
          Roosevelt cites for his administration. Besides conservation, do they 
          see any other "frontiers" explored by Roosevelt&#146;s administration? 
          Also have students outline the recommendations for conserving water, 
          forests, land and minerals. How does conservation fit into the larger 
          goals of the progressives? As a written assignment, ask the students 
          to write an editorial from the point of view of either a conservationist 
          or a western business newspaper at the end of Roosevelt&#146;s presidency.<br>
