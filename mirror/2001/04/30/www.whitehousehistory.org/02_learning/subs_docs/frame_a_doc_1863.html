          studying events that occurred before the widespread use of photography, 
          historians have used artwork to supplement resources such as documents, 
          diaries, and artifacts. While an artist&#146;s view of an event is less 
          accurate than first-hand written accounts, many paintings and engravings 
          can tell us what events were found important enough to document in this 
          way. Artists, after all, were in the business of selling their works, 
          and would often offer popular images that were attractive to buyers. 
          Using symbols, an artist can tell a story beyond the actual event that 
          a photographer cannot. The engraving used in this lesson, &quot;First 
          Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation before Lincoln&#146;s Cabinet,&quot; 
          is derived from one of the best-known historical paintings in American 
          history, along with John Trumbull&#146;s paintings of the Battle of 
          Bunker Hill and the signing of the Declaration of Independence.<font size="-1"><br>

          in the Union forces against their former owners. They will also understand

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="4"><i>Introduction</i></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the beginning of the 
          Civil War, the U.S. Congress had passed a resolution stating that it 
          had no interest in destroying slavery, simply in preserving the Union. 
          The more radical members of the Republican Party, however, saw the war 
          in moral terms and insisted that slaves should be emancipated. As the 
          number of casualties rose and it became clear that victory would not 
          come easily, more and more Northerners began to favor freeing the slaves, 
          some for moral reasons, but others wanted to punish Southern slaveholders 
          or simply thought freeing the slaves would be a good way of disrupting 
          the Southern war effort.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">President Abraham Lincoln 
          drafted a proclamation freeing the slaves, which he first read to his 
          Cabinet on July 22, 1862, an event captured on canvas by Francis Carpenter. 
          Secretary of State William Seward suggested that the proclamation should 
          not be issued until after a Union victory, so that it would not seem 
          to be a desperate measure. In September 1862, after Union troops won 
          the battle of Antietam, President Lincoln issued the <i>preliminary</i> 
          Emancipation Proclamation, announcing that he would officially sign 
          the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, unless the Southern 
          states ended the war. On the first day of 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation 
          went into effect. It expanded the aim of the war: to the preservation 
          of the union was added a battle for freedom. Lincoln stated that &quot;all 
          persons held as slaves&quot; within the rebellious states &quot;shall 
          be then, thenceforward, and forever free.&quot; Those slaves held in 
          any Union state were not affected, nor were those slaves in the South 
          who lived in territory that had already come under Union control. The 
          Proclamation also invited people of color to join the U.S. Army and 
          Navy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some northerners felt Lincoln 
          did not go far enough, that he did not speak in strong moral terms and 
          should not have allowed slavery to remain in such places as the Union 
          border states. Other northerners opposed emancipation: some owned slaves 
          and feared that eventually their own slaves would be liberated by the 
          order, and some northerners thought that they might lose their jobs 
          when freed slaves flooded to their cities and towns looking for work. 
          Lincoln himself believed the Emancipation Proclamation was &quot;the 
          central act of my administration, and the great event of the nineteenth 
          century.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="4"><i>Activity</i></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Artists in the 19<sup>th</sup> 
          century often painted or engraved historical scenes, and they can be 
          used to better understand dramatic events of the American past. When 
          evaluating artwork as a historical document one should consider the 
          artist&#146;s knowledge of the event he or she is depicting. Did the 
          artist know the subjects? Did he have access to those who were present 
          at the event so he could faithfully record it? The artist&#146;s point 
          of view, or his attempt to symbolize larger ideas in a painting, must 
          be considered when studying the historical artwork. Did the artist want 
          to make a statement? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From February through July 
          1864, artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter (1830-1900) worked at the White 
          House creating a painting entitled, &quot;First Reading of the Emancipation 
          Proclamation before Lincoln&#146;s Cabinet.&quot; Carpenter was a strong 
          opponent of slavery and had already gained some fame for his portraits 
          of political leaders. This painting shows President Lincoln in his White 
          House office reading a draft of the proclamation, an event that occurred 
          on July 22, 1862. While Carpenter was not present for the actual event, 
          he spoke extensively with the president and others about the occasion 
          and wrote about his experiences in <i>The Inner Life of Abraham Lincoln: 
          Six Months at the White House</i> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 
          1995).</font></p>

          Stanton (seated), Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, President

          Caleb B. Smith, Postmaster General Montgomery Blair, Attorney General 
          Edward Bates, Secretary of State William Seward (seated in front of 
          the table)<br>
          <br>
          A parchment copy of the U.S. Constitution lies on the cabinet table, 
          and a portrait of Andrew Jackson can be seen through the chandelier. 
          Jackson, who served as president thirty years before Lincoln, was known 
          for his strong union stance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Have students examine the 
          picture<font color="#CC00FF"> </font> and answer these questions using 
          information they already know, added to knowledge they gain from studying 
          the picture.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. Carpenter was very careful 
          about where he placed the various people in the painting; his purpose, 
          he said, &quot;was to give that prominence to the different individuals 
          which belonged to them respectively in the Administration.&quot; Based 
          on that intention, who were the most prominent people? Who were the 
          least prominent? Based on where people were in relation to Lincoln (nearer, 
          farther), who were the people likeliest to support his program?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. Study each cabinet member. 
          Look at their facial expressions and body language. How do you think 
          each cabinet member reacted to the Proclamation based on your observations? 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. There are two documents 
          in the picture, the Emancipation Proclamation and the U.S. Constitution. 
          Where are they located and why are they in the picture? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. The painting hanging 
          on the wall behind the chandelier is a portrait of Andrew Jackson. Why 
          is it in the picture?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">5. Lighting can also be 
          used symbolically. What parts of the painting are well lit? What parts 
          are dark? What might Carpenter be trying to convey by this lighting?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">6. What kind of overall 
          impression does the painting give? How would you describe in words the 
          event that Carpenter painted?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="4"><i>Afterword</i></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to Carpenter, 
          Postmaster General Blair opposed the Emancipation Proclamation, because 
          he believed it would prove costly to the Republican Party in the fall 
          congressional elections that year. Secretary of the Interior Smith was 
          similarly concerned about the voters&#146; reaction, while Attorney 
          General Bates doubted that the Proclamation was constitutional. Secretary 
          of the Treasury Chase was a longtime opponent of slavery, as was Secretary 
          of State Seward, and strongly supported the Emancipation Proclamation. 
          Secretary of War Stanton had long advocated using African-American troops. 
          Secretary of the Navy Wells also supported the Proclamation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="4"><i>Enrichment 
          and Extension</i></font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. Have students find a 
          photograph that captured a famous historical event (John F. Kennedy&#146;s 
          funeral, Charles Lindbergh landing in Paris, etc.) and do some background 
          research so they understand the figures and setting. Have them imagine 
          that the photograph is their memory of being at the event, and then 
          have students put the photograph away and draw or paint the scene. Compare 
          the photo with their artwork. How accurate were they? Did certain figures 
          become more or less prominent? How important did the subjects vs. the 
          setting become in their artwork? Did some figures become &quot;larger 
          than life?&quot; Did their artwork have a message? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. The use of symbols in 
          art to represent larger ideas is as old as art itself. Books on the 
          table in a portrait represent an educated gentleman. The lion stands 
          for courage in a coat of arms. An olive branch indicates a striving 
          for peace. Today, symbols take many forms: a flag represents a nation, 
          a logo represents a company or product, the elephant and donkey represent 
          the Republican and Democratic political parties. From looking around 
          the classroom, students should be able to locate symbols. Ask students 
          to go further and search through magazines and newspapers and collect 
          symbols. Cut and paste the symbols, display them to classmates and quiz 
          them on the meaning of the symbols. Are some symbols more easily recognized 
          than others? Is there room for disagreement on what a symbol represents, 
          or should it be universally understood? Have each student research the 
          origins of one symbol that they collected.<br>
