        of the past are all around us. The buildings that survive through the 
        years are artifacts that can tell us a great deal about the values and 
        aspirations of the people who built them. Architects use size, massing, 
        ornamentation, symmetry or asymmetry, and other design features to project 
        an overall image of a structure. This lesson will focus on one of the 
        most famous buildings in America, the White House, to determine what image 
        its builders meant to project.<font size="-1"><br>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After declaring independence 
          from Britain in 1776, the Congress of the United States had wandered 
          around the Mid-Atlantic States, looking for a home. At various times, 
          Philadelphia, Princeton, Trenton, Annapolis, and other cities had served 
          as the nation&#146;s capital. European observers, accustomed to having 
          capitals hundreds of years old, ridiculed the new nation for lacking 
          a permanent seat of government. More importantly, many Europeans&#151;and 
          some Americans&#151;were skeptical that a republican form of government 
          would endure. History had seen many republics come and go; only the 
          Roman Republic had endured for long, and it collapsed into dictatorship.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1789, after the ratification 
          of the U.S. Constitution created a stronger national government, President 
          George Washington and a newly chosen Congress assumed office in the 
          temporary capital of New York City. After deciding to build a permanent 
          capital, Congress authorized President Washington to choose a site for 
          the city and pick a design and site for the President&#146;s House. 
          The building would be the first undertaken as the federal government 
          prepared to move to its new home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1792, at Washington&#146;s 
          request, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced an architectural 
          competition to produce design drawings for the President&#146;s House. 
          Washington insisted that the building should be made of stone, so that 
          it would have a more substantial appearance, much like the most important 
          buildings in Europe. The President&#146;s House would be the largest 
          residence in the country until after the Civil War. The young nation 
          had never seen anything like it, and that was what Washington liked 
          about it. The building was to be more than the home and office of the 
          president; it was to be a symbol of the presidency. A republic could 
          not have a king&#146;s palace, but the building must command respect 
          from citizens in the United States and, just as importantly, foreign 
          visitors who came to visit America&#146;s leader. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">President Washington also 
          hoped that the public buildings in the new capital &quot;in size, form, 
          and elegance shou&#146;d look beyond the present day.&quot; The nation 
          could not afford anything too extravagant at this time, but the design 
          should allow for flexibility in the future, when the nation progressed. 
          &quot;For the Presidents House,&quot; wrote the nation&#146;s leader, 
          &quot;I would design a building which should also look forward, but 
          execute no more of it at present than might suit the circumstances of 
          this Country when it shall be first wanted. A plan comprehending more 
          may be executed at a future period when the wealth, population, and 
          importance of it shall stand upon much higher ground than they do at 
          present.&quot;<br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          On July 16, 1792, President Washington examined at least six designs 
          submitted in the President&#146;s House architectural competition. The 
          plans were quite varied. Have your students examine three of these designs.<font color="#CC00FF"> 
          </font>They are presented as <i>elevations</i>, showing the front of 
          the building, as if you were standing outside looking at it from across 
          the street or lawn. One of the designs is by James Hoban, an Irishman 
          whom the president had met a year earlier in Charleston. A second plan 
          was submitted by a mysterious man known only as &quot;A.Z.&quot; Historians 
          have speculated that Thomas Jefferson was the mystery designer, but 
          records suggest that the architect likely was John Collins, a builder 
          from Richmond, Virginia. The third design is by James Diamond, a Maryland 
          inventor. <i><b>Click on photos for full image:</b></i><br>

          the role of visitors from Britain or France in 1792, ancient countries 
          with splendid castles, cathedrals, and public buildings. President Washington 
          invited these visitors to tea, where he showed them the three designs. 
          Have the students, as these foreign visitors, write entries in their 
          journals describing the three designs and offering an opinion as to 
          which one President Washington should pick and why. For a contrast, 
          you might also have the students go through the same assignment, but 
          as American frontier settlers, farmers barely eking out an existence 
          beyond the Appalachian Mountains and living in ramshackle cabins.</font></p>

          Washington announced that the winner of the design competition was James 
          Hoban. By 1792, political parties were beginning to develop in the new 
          nation. Rather than attempting to be nonpartisan, most newspapers openly 
          favored either the Federalists, who controlled the government, or their 
          opponents, who were gradually coming to be known as Republicans. Have 
          your students write newspaper editorials, either as Federalists extolling 
          the President&#146;s design choice or as Republicans criticizing his 
          choice.</font></p>

          students to each building type: churches, stores, apartment buildings, 
          houses, offices, etc. Have each group report on their type, explaining 
          how they share characteristics, and how they differ in design. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. Have students research 
          a favorite historic building that they have visited or admired, and 
          write a brief essay on the origins of the structure. Who commissioned 
          the building, and why? What are the most interesting design elements? 
          If they can find an image of the architect&#146;s drawings, have them 
          compare it to a photograph of the building. Did the builders follow 
          the architect&#146;s plans? <br>
