          December 13, 2000 &#151; thirty-six days after Americans cast their 
          votes for president of the United States &#151; George W. Bush claimed 
          the White House in a speech from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives. 
          After a ruling by the Supreme Court effectively ended the election and 
          after Democratic candidate Al Gore conceded one of the closest elections 
          in American history, Bush reached back two centuries to find a precedent 
          for such a contentious and prolonged presidential contest. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After the Electoral College 
          produced a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr in 1800, the 
          election was thrown into the United States House of Representatives. 
          After 36 ballots, president-elect Bush related, the tie was finally 
          broken, and Thomas Jefferson became the nation&#146;s chief executive. 
          But both Jefferson and Burr were Republicans. The more significant event 
          was that a Republican won the office over the Federalist candidate, 
          John Adams. In a letter written years later, Jefferson would define 
          this first transfer of political power as the &quot;revolution of 1800.&quot; 
          After the final ballots were counted, however, Jefferson's immediate 
          tasks were to write and present his inaugural address. The address has 
          been called one of the most important in U. S. history, and some of 
          the phrases still ring through the ages.<font size="-1"><br>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Upon the ratification of 
          the Constitution in 1788 came the election of the first president of 
          the United States in the spring of the following year. There seemed 
          little doubt that George Washington &#150; commander in chief of the 
          Continental Army, presiding officer at the Constitutional Convention, 
          and America's first true hero &#150; would be chosen. Indeed the electoral 
          votes were cast and the decision was unanimous. Washington was inaugurated 
          at New York's Federal Hall in April 1789. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Historians have well noted 
          Washington's attempts to remain above party politics and his frequent 
          warnings that factions could only serve to fracture national unity. 
          There were no formal, organized political parties during his administration 
          but two competing political philosophies did arise during his two terms 
          and became more overt during the administration of second president, 
          John Adams. Washington retired after his second term. Washington's vice 
          president, Adams, defeated Thomas Jefferson in the election of 1796. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Washington and Adams shared 
          the view that a strong federal government was America's best hope. They 
          and their followers became known as Federalists. The substantial tasks 
          involved in shaping and strengthening a republic spread over vast geographical 
          distances would, in their minds, require guidance that only centralized 
          power could provide. Some historians also believe that Washington and 
          the elite group of men who framed the Constitution feared that local 
          governments were drawing from a well of citizens that did not have the 
          capabilities to lead. These ill-educated men with their narrow parochial 
          interests were not equipped or resolved to look beyond the needs of 
          their sparsely settled regions. In short, they lacked a national vision. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Others disagreed, and they 
          argued that political power, and so political destiny, should reside 
          in the separate states. The best national government was small government: 
          a reduced military force and limited taxes. Those hardworking farmers 
          and merchants at the local level were the same rebels who resisted and 
          defeated a monarchical form of government. They should be left alone 
          to carve out their futures. Thomas Jefferson was the leader of those 
          who favored a less obtrusive federal government and they took the name 
          of Republican. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jefferson made his views 
          known discretely, first as Washington's secretary of state and then 
          as vice president under Adams. Both the Federalists (<i>Gazette of the 
          United States)</i> and Republicans (<i>National Gazette</i>) controlled 
          their own newspapers and through anonymous articles published in them, 
          opponents Alexander Hamilton and Jefferson could argue their causes. 
          Because the Constitution did not anticipate political parties it was 
          possible for the president and vice president to hold different political 
          viewpoints and in 1796 that is, in fact, what happened. Adams received 
          the most electoral votes and Jefferson came in second and so they won 
          the top two positions in the executive branch. This led to incredible 
          tensions over key policy issues, especially the Alien and Sedition Acts, 
          championed by Adams. In brief, the Republicans and their press charged 
          Adams and the Federalists with attempting to thwart them on a number 
          of hot political issues during the United States' undeclared war with 
          France. Many Republicans tended to be Francophiles and they worried 
          that the Alien Act targeted immigrants who would likely be attracted 
          to Republican ideals. The Sedition Act, the Republicans argued, was 
          an attempt to stifle legitimate newspapers because they opposed Federalist 
          policies: a free speech violation. As it became clear that Adams would 
          lose the election of 1800, he added to the animosity between the president 
          and the president-elect when he appointed a number of Federalist judges, 
          including Chief Justice John Marshall, in the waning weeks of his administration. 
          On March 4, 1801, the first inauguration day in the new capital city 
          of Washington, Jefferson made his presidential pronouncement on the 
          past difficulties and his vision for the future.<br>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. Jefferson is considered 
          one of America's greatest writers. His inaugural address is filled with 
          beautifully constructed thoughts, well expressed. Several phrases are 
          still quoted today: "entangling alliances"; "every difference of opinion 
          is not a difference of principle"; and "we are all Republicans, we are 
          all Federalists." Consider the historical context of these phrases and

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. Consider Jefferson's 
          agenda. Find phrases and sections in which he discusses his views of 
          the American republic and highlight them. For example, where does he 
          discuss his tax policy, states rights, foreign policy, debt reduction? 
          Create a list of policy topics accompanied by Jefferson's language, 
          then use 21<sup>st</sup>-century "straight talk" to interpret the president's 
          text. Go further and compare these policies to those of the Federalists. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Jefferson acknowledges 
          the audience, Congress, in his inaugural speech. He also refers to George 
          Washington ("our first and greatest revolutionary character&quot;). 
          Does he mention his predecessor, John Adams? Does he refer to Adams's

          <br>
          Almost 20 years after the election of 1800, Jefferson evaluated the 
          events of that first political party transition, and described it as 
          a "revolution." He wrote to Spencer Roane on September 6, 1819: "[The 
          election] was as real a revolution in the principles of our government 
          as that of [17]76 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, 
          as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the 
          suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries 
          of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, 
          executive and legislative, submitted to their election." The election 
          put Republicans in control of the White House and Congress.<br>
          <br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jefferson obviously 
          considered the "revolution" a great success. Indeed from the time of 
          Jefferson's election until his death in 1826 a Republican occupied the 
          White House. But in his inaugural address you will find many passages 
          exhorting Americans to unite for the good of the nation. Many presidents 
          have found that their first official speech required such language. 
          But there are abundant documents that show that Jefferson did not mean 
          that Federalists and Republicans could find common ground, as much as 
          he hoped to convince Federalists to change their thinking to mirror 
          his. The year after his first inauguration, he wrote to a friend: "I 
          shall . . . by the establishment of republican principles . . . sink 
          federalism into an abyss from which there shall be no resurrection for 
          it." <br>
          <br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Select and research 
          another presidential transition during times of dramatic change. What 
          were the causes of the tensions or fears? Was the nation in real peril? 
          How did the incoming president attempt to calm the nation in his inaugural 
          address? Was he successful? For several examples on this site go to

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2. You Say You Want a Revolution?<br>
        <br>
        </b>Revolution is a word tossed around in political circles with regularity 
        today, but to the founding generation that took part in the first American 
        Revolution, it was more likely to carry significant meaning. Historians 
        also consider the first American Revolution to extend beyond the period 
        between Bunker Hill and the peace treaty with Britain. The forging of 
        the U.S. Constitution and the first government to serve under that charter 
        in 1789 are considered to be culminations of a movement that began with 
        the resistance to the Stamp Act in 1765.<br>
        <br>
        When describing the election of 1800 as a second American "revolution," 
        students will need to provide some context of the first revolution. Jefferson 
        saw the election of Republicans to be a call from the American people 
        to return to the spirit of 1776, to the fight for individual rights, and 
        to the struggle to recover "virtue" in government. The third president 
        thought that the Federalists had moved closer to monarchical ways of thinking 
        and acting, exactly opposite of the intentions of the rebels. In fact, 
        one prominent biographer claims this was not a "revolution" but a "reformation" 
        in that Jefferson and the Republicans were reaching back in time to revive 
        original ideals.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This would be a good 
        topic for a paper or a performance with the student(s) portraying Jefferson 
        and/or an opponent and using excerpts from the inaugural address and the 
        letter to Spencer Roane to prepare the script. For these and more examples
