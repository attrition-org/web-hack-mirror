Sysadmin, your server has weak security.  Since just telling you about it would likely not have resulted in it being fixed, hopefully this will be more persuasive!<br>
<br>
No files have been deleted.  Your origional web page has been renamed with a .BAK entention.  Please patch your server to avoid future defacements!<BR>
<br>
I'd be happy to discuss the security issues of your server with you.. please contact me at electricfreshie@yahoo.com.
