        The internet is a powerful and dynamic communication tool
        that knows no borders and should be used by every type of
        organization that is anticipating the dawn of the 21st
        century.<br>
        This is the basic principle that guides us when
        introducing internet marketing techniques as an integral
        part of your firm's marketing mix and as an essential,
        efficient and modern way of communicating with ones
        target market, citizens, voters and community members.<br>
        The internet provides access to, and means for
        interactive communication with, organizations and
        individuals which belong to a community that numbers in
        the tens of millions and is rapidly growing.<br>
        Multimedia is developing so fast that it is not long
        before the computer, TV, telephone, stereo, and video are
        all put into one multimedia machine and anyone anywhere
        will be able to access on line communication.<br>
        The idea of linking up all the world's computers together
        will bring us into a new era, where information will
        easily flow and will be readily available to mankind
        everywhere.<br>
        This will surely have its effect in encouraging
        interpersonal communication and greater world
        cooperation.<br>
