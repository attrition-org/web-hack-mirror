    the intent was not to harm your information or your ego but to bring attention to the
    security or lack thereof regarding this machine. none of your files have been interrupted
    other than this web service and some logs. whether you find this ethical or malicious
    might depend on your tolerance to alcohol. hopefully a little motivation will help you
    review your security posture and methods to prevent future penetrations of this kind - its
    only a matter of time until this will happen to you again so why not learn from the
    experience, dont lose your high, i didnt hurt anything. you should have a drink, make it a
    triple jack n coke and goto www.security-focus.com and educate yourself. if you have
    security personnel, commence to pimp slapping them for sleeping on the job. todays the day
    you get to be a real admin mmmkay??#!&nbsp; -&nbsp;</cite></span></font></p>
