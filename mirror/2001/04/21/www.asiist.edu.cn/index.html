OK - some words about the whole china thing. Yeh it was fun going after .cn because their little crackers threatened our servers - but honestly folks - it was all in fun - for me anyway. Kind of like bragging rights over dodgeball. PoisonB0x did a shitload but I know his wasnt all in seriousness either. theirs I guess I should say - sup DC. Anyway - the chinese crackers proved to be no fun - so I guess its just back to random messages again. sigh.
