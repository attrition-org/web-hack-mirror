<P>The past few decades have witnessed extraordinary progress in the development
of techniques for noninvasive structural and functional imaging of the
human brain.&nbsp; However, despite this progress, no existing medical
imaging modality provides all of the information required for best clinical
practice or cutting edge basic research.&nbsp; MRI is the premier technique
for characterizing the soft tissue anatomy of the human brain, but has
significant limitations for defining the geometry of the skull.&nbsp; Functional
MRI, and PET&nbsp; provided detailed pictures of spatial patterns of neural
activation based on associated hemodynamic changes, but cannot capture
the temporal dynamics of electrophysiological activation on its characteristic
timescale.&nbsp; MEG and EEG provide excellent temporal resolution of neural
population dynamics but are limited in spatial resolution by the ambiguity
and ill-posed nature of the current reconstruction problem.&nbsp; Electrical
and magnetic stimulation offer the possibility of direct intervention in
central or peripheral neural pathways, but depend on knowledge of anatomical
and functional organization drawn from other sources.&nbsp; Other methods,
including optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, SPECT and nuclear
medicine, histology, endoscopy, neurosurgical intervention, etc., each
provide important and unique insight into neural function and functional
organization.&nbsp; Although the mix and relative importance of imaging
technologies will continue to evolve, the need to integrate information
from multiple methods will remain.

<P>The goal of research supported by the <A HREF="humanbp/humanbp.html">Human
Brain Project</A> is to develop composite techniques for noninvasive, functional
brain imaging that provide spatial and temporal resolution superior to
any available imaging technique.&nbsp; We are developing experimental,
theoretical and computational procedures to combine anatomical MRI, functional
MRI, and MEG into an integrated structural/functional imaging technique
that exploits the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of each modality
alone.

<P>The second major effort addresses the development and application of
<B>Advanced Optical Methods&nbsp;</B> for tissue measurements on the macroscopic
and microscopic scale.&nbsp; For macroscopic measurements the principal
challenge is the highly scattering nature of biological tissue.&nbsp; Tissue
is relatively translucent, particularly in the near IR, and these wavelengths
provide useful spectral data, e.g. allowing measurement of the quantity
and oxygenation state of hemoglobin.&nbsp; However, a photon in the near
IR may scatter >10 times per cm , so that light travels through tissue
by a process that resembles diffusion.&nbsp; To address the uncertainty
in path and pathlength we are developing time-resolved imaging methods
that allow measurement of the time of flight of photons launched into the
medium.&nbsp; The first approach&nbsp; employs high-speed gated intensifiers
(gate time ~200 ps) coupled to cooled CCDs.&nbsp; A second strategy currently
being explored will employ <A HREF="http://www.rulli.lanl.gov">time-resolved
photon counting technologies </A>developed at Los Alamos.&nbsp; This class
of methods coupled with sophisticated modeling techniques shows promise
for noninvasive quantitative characterization and <A HREF="optical/PMT.html"><B>tomographic
reconstruction</B> </A>of the optical properties of highly scattering media
such as brain tissue.

<P>A second project is developing a hybrid hardware/software technology
for <A HREF="optical/adv_micro_imag.html">confocal and spectral imaging
</A>via microscope or endoscope.&nbsp; A prototype imager has been employed
for in situ imaging of fast intrinsic signals associated with excitation
in the brainstem of an experimental animal, and shows promise for characterizing
patterns of cellular activity in extended neural networks.&nbsp; These
technologies are presently being developed with support from the DOE Technology
Transfer Initiative
