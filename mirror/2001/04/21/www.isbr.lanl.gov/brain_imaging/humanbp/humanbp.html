The goal of our research is to develop experimental, theoretical and computational
procedures to combine anatomical MRI, functional MRI, and MEG into an integrated
structural/functional imaging technique that provides spatial and temporal
resolution superior to any available imaging technique.

<P><B>&nbsp;Neural electromagnetic measurements</B> (in particular MEG
and EEG) provide a number of advantages for the noninvasive characterization
of neural function.&nbsp; These techniques measure direct physical correlates
of the currents associated with neural activation, and provide temporal
resolution adequate for the study of neural population responses.&nbsp;
However, the general computational problem of source localization from
such surface measurements is ill-posed and ambiguous:&nbsp; multiple current
configurations can account for any given set of surface measurements.&nbsp;
By employing models of neuronal current configurations that limit the space
of possible inverse solutions it is possible to obtain useful source reconstructions.&nbsp;
The reliability and accuracy of such techniques can be significantly enhanced
and by employing external information from alternative imaging modalities
such as anatomical and functional MRI, however the use of rigid constraints
based on such data may introduce errors under some circumstances.

<P>We have developed a probabilistic<A HREF="http://stella.lanl.gov/dms/bi/bi.html">
Bayesian framework</A> for neural source localization that effectively
deals with the ambiguity of the neural electromagnetic inverse problem,
while providing a powerful method for integrated analyses incorporating
multiple disparate sources of data.&nbsp; This framework provides a useful
and general method for describing extended neural sources that can exploit
probabilistic maps of functional architecture.&nbsp; This might serve as
a useful construct for the development of database schemes that incorporate
probabilistic descriptions of neural temporal response.

<P>Aims of future work include:

<P><B>Continued development of the theoretical framework and computational
methods for integrated analysis of multi-modality image data:</B>&nbsp;
Bayesian probabilistic analyses hold promise for useful solutions to the
MEG /EEG inverse problem, and for integration of disparate forms of image
data.&nbsp; Probabilistic constraints on source location and spatial extent
will be developed, based on functional neuroimaging data (fMRI or PET)
or drawn from databases.&nbsp; A second area of work will be development
and evaluation of detailed finite difference forward models based on MRI
techniques that produce volumetric estimates of tissue conductivity, allowing
assessment of the effect of anisotropy and inhomogeneity of brain conductivity
on magnetic field and electric potential distributions.

<P><B>Enhanced experimental and analytical methods for functional neuroimaging:</B>&nbsp;
Event related fMRI can employ the same experimental designs routinely used
for studies with MEG and EEG.&nbsp; Extensions to visual stimulus generation,
timing capability and analysis tools will be implemented to conduct such
experiments.&nbsp; Relevant physiological data (cardiac cycle, respiratory
cycle, blood pressure and blood oxygenation) will be collected to allow
assessment of the roles of these variables in modulating the fMRI BOLD
response and to correct for such effects.&nbsp; Investigation and development
of an MR technique for movement monitoring and correction will continue.

<P><B>Computational tool development:&nbsp;</B> A primary goal of proposed
work is to build a consolidated package for multimodality functional neuroimaging
based on computational modules developed in our laboratory, including <A HREF="../mriview/mriview.html">MRIVIEW</A>
(a tool for structure/function correlation and MRI volume processing) and
<A HREF="../megan/megan.html">MEGAN</A> (a tool for the analysis of neural
electromagnetic (NEM) data).&nbsp; The consolidated package include a series
of electromagnetic forward calculations of increasing anatomical realism,
and will provide an extensive (and extendible) suite of inverse procedures
with proven utility and merit. A public domain version of this package
will be produced,&nbsp; however, avenues for commercial development and
continuing support of the software will also be pursued.
