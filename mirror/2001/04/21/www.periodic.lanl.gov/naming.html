<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">After
more than three years of sometimes acrimonious debate across the borders of many
nations, an international body of chemists has reached a tentative agreement on
the names to be bestowed upon six new chemical elements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The
elements themselves, numbers 104 through 109 on the periodic table, were created
by accelerator laboratories in the United States, Germany, and Russia over the
last two decades and have little significance for non-scientists. Only a few
atoms of each of these elements ever existed, and none survived after its
creation for more than a few seconds before decaying radioactively into atomic
debris.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">But the
naming of a chemical element is influenced by national pride, professional
rivalry and personal sensitivities; the picking of a single name can provoke as
much back-room bickering and bargaining as the selection of an international
beauty queen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The
final court of appeals in this process is the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry, with member chemists from about 80 countries. Within the
Union, factions representing the United States, Germany, Russia and several
other nations have bitterly disagreed about names.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">A
particularly sharp disagreement began three years ago when the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., backed by the American Chemical Society,
tentatively named element 106 seaborgium, with the chemical symbol Sg. The name
honored Glenn T. Seaborg, an American chemist and Nobel laureate, whose team
created 10 new elements during and after World War II. In 1940, Seaborg's
research group at Berkeley used an accelerator to make <span style="color:maroon" class="MsoHyperlink">neptunium</span>,
the first element heavier than <span style="color:maroon" class="MsoHyperlink">uranium</span>
(Before neptunium, the only element existing solely as a laboratory product was <span style="color:maroon" class="MsoHyperlink">technetium</span>,
which is No. 43 on the periodic table. It was created in 1937 by the fusion of
atomic nuclei.).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Seaborg's
team went on to create <span style="color:maroon" class="MsoHyperlink">plutonium</span>,
the element fueling the atomic bomb that destroyed Nagasaki, and eight other
artificial elements. The American Chemical Society believed that international
confirmation of the name seaborgium would be mere formality, but instead the
international chemists' union provisionally named Element 106 rutherfordium
honoring New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Adding
insult to injury, in the view of the Berkeley group, the international union
proposed naming element 104 dubnium, recognizing achievements in nuclear physics
by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, Russia. The Berkeley
scientists and many other American physicists are skeptical of some of the
claims made by the Dubna laboratory to having created new elements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">After
years of debate, the international union came up last month [Jan 1997] with a
compromise list that most American chemists deem acceptable. David F. Eaton, a
chemist at DuPont Corp. who headed the American delegation throughout the
bargaining, said in an interview that all the American laboratories involved in
the dispute were satisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Subject
to confirmation by the union's members at a meeting in Geneva next August
[1997], these will be the names of the six new elements: Element 104,
Rutherfordium (symbol Rf); Element 105, Dubnium (symbol Db); Element 106,
Seaborgium (symbol Sg); Element 107, Bohrioum (symbol Bh); Element 108, Hassium
(symbol Hs), bol Mt).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">(Bohrium
takes its name from Niels Bohr, a Dane, who was a founder of quantum physics.
Hassium is the Latin name for the German province Hesse, the seat of the
laboratory where elements 109 and 110 were created, as well as a single atom of
element 112 one year ago [1996]. Meitnerium is named for the Austrian-born
physicist Lise Meitner.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Dropped
from the union's previous list of provisional names are joliotium for Element
105, for the French physicist Frederick Jolie-Curie, and hahnium for Element
108, honoring the German physicist Otto Hahn. &quot;Fortunately, However,&quot;
Eaton said, &quot;we still have some unnamed elements to play with: Elements
110, 111 and 112.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">All
three were created in Darmstadt, Germany, by the Society for Heavy Ion Research,
and by tradition, the creator or discoverer of an element has the privilege of
proposing its name. Consequently, hahnium has a chance of rejoining the periodic
table, and even the French joliotium might make into the pantheon. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Final
settlement of the issue will be a relief for the publishers of chemistry
textbooks and scientific papers around the world; in the current confusion, five
different versions of the periodic table are in circulation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">&quot;I
think we're seeing real progress,&quot; Eaton said.</span></p>
