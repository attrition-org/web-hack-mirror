      <p>OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE</b></font></p>
      <p>Dramatic changes in the global political and economic environment have occurred in the
      last decade that have impacted Los Alamos National Laboratory at every level from the way
      in which we do business to what business we do. The political and economic changes have
      impacted the societal view of the role for science and technology in general, and the role
      of the national weapons laboratories in particular. With the end of the cold war, the long
      term strategy for research in the national weapons laboratories is being reassessed in a
      climate of increasing concern about economic, environmental, and health security whereas
      previously the focus was on a dominant superpower opponent. Our nuclear mission now must
      support the nation&#146;s need for nuclear deterrence without testing. As we look toward
      the future, the Fellows wish to begin a dialog with the Director and the new Deputy
      Director for Science, Technology, and Programs and with the entire Executive Team. We wish
      to contribute to ensuring the Laboratory&#146;s scientific and technological
      competitiveness in areas that will be essential for addressing future threats to our
      national security. Drawing upon our collective experience we can contribute ideas to the
      development of major new scientific themes for the Laboratory of the future. </p>
      <p>In the Ehlers report to Congress by the House Committee on Science (September 24, 1998)
      four main themes are emphasized in looking toward a new national science policy. They are:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Ensuring the flow of new ideas
        by the support of fundamental research, recognizing that important discoveries often come
        from unexpected avenues; </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Transferring new discoveries
        and knowledge to applications; </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Providing sound technical and
        scientific data for government decision making; and </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Fostering education and
        communication.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The long-term future of the national weapons laboratories will depend upon our success
      in each of these four areas. Importantly, these broad goals must be achieved in the
      context of sustaining critical ongoing programmatic roles that maintain our national
      security supremacy. </p>
      <p>The United States of America has enjoyed great benefits from a forward looking science
      policy in which fundamental and applied research, encompassing programmatic and
      curiosity-driven research, have prospered. In the current climate of rapidly changing
      priorities, a forward looking and vital national defense research program is required to
      ensure we will be in a position to defend against increasingly diverse technological and
      natural threats. Key elements to our being able to develop technological solutions to
      threats to national security will include: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>The ability to redirect our
        efforts rapidly in response to new threats;</p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Multidisciplinary approaches
        to understanding complexity and the development of solutions to complex problems;</p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Developing and harnessing our
        computational power for predictive power, including prediction of errors and uncertainty;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Our increasingly sophisticated understanding of the physical universe has enabled
      scientists and engineers to tackle increasing complex problems. This increased complexity
      has required specialists to diversify and collaborate across disciplinary lines to find
      innovative solutions. The boundaries between physics, chemistry and biology have been
      blurred. Science and technology are beginning to tackle the once unimaginable challenge of
      having a complete molecular level understanding of the chemistry and physics of living
      systems and astounding progress has been made in theoretical modeling and prediction in
      biology. We are tackling mammoth computational tasks such as modeling the global climate
      in order to predict long term changes. Computational power has unleashed spectacular
      possibilities for modeling and simulation of complex phenomena that underpin the new world
      order in which nuclear weapons tests are banned. The importance of experimentally
      validated simulation of complex phenomena has become paramount in this era of test bans.
      True scientific and technological superiority required for national security must also
      push on the frontiers of fundamental theoretical understanding of complex phenomena. </p>
      <p>To initiate our dialog we have developed short white papers around six topic areas. The
      Fellows formed teams to work on each topic. Imprinted on the output of these teams is the
      diversity and individuality of the Fellows, with attention paid to issues spanning from
      what may seem mundane but of great importance to the almost fanciful but with great
      potential to unleash capabilities that could revolutionize our lives. The topic areas were
      chosen are those in which, at this point in time, we see major scientific opportunities or
      imperatives. We have endeavored to focus, although not exclusively, on the long-term
      future (~10 years out). In doing so our discussion by necessity builds upon the insights
      obtained within this current snap shot of time and is therefore expected to evolve. </p>
      <p>The six topic areas we chose have overlapping elements and common themes. We have not
      attempted to compartmentalize the topics by eliminating overlap because the different
      teams each bring different perspectives within the context of their topic. The focus of
      the <b>Bioscience </b>topic is on the importance of having a molecular level understanding
      of biological processes and utilizing that understanding for biotechnology applications in
      the environment and in human health security. <b>Cybernetics </b>discusses the potential
      civilian and military applications of advances at the man machine interface, as well as in
      microrobotics, prosthesis, biocomputers, biosensors, self wiring computers, and robotic
      sensing. In the <b>Energy</b> topic nuclear approaches to energy sufficiency are
      considered along with the potential of biological systems for providing &quot;clean&quot;
      energy. The contributions of integrated computational and experimental approaches to
      energy and the environment are discussed in reference to climate modeling, combustion, as
      well as catalysis and separations. The <b>Materials </b>topic emphasizes the depth and
      breadth of materials research at Los Alamos. While materials are of central importance to
      the nuclear weapons program there are also opportunities for fundamental and applied
      research in materials for energy applications, bio-materials, electronic and optical
      materials. <b>National Security </b>deals with our central mission responsibilities
      regarding the stockpile, and expands into our roles in defense against weapons of mass
      destruction, tactical and theater missile defense, computational weapons, and protection
      of our infrastructure and environment. In the <b>Neutrons </b>topic the importance of our
      competency in accelerator technology and the science that it serves is emphasized from
      fundamental nuclear and materials science to accelerator transmutation of waste,
      production of tritium, and radiography applications. </p>
      <p>With these collective thoughts we hope to begin a forward looking and productive dialog
      that will be of value to the Laboratory. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="5"><b></p>
      <p>BIOSCIENCE </b></font></p>
      <p>The focus of modern biology is moving increasingly toward the goal of understanding
      complete molecular networks in living systems. Understanding the structure and dynamics of
      biomolecules and their molecular networks, how they operate, and how signals are
      communicated to obtain the desired response to a stimulus or to maintain involuntary
      functions is a challenge to which Los Alamos can make key contributions. Importantly,
      specific molecular networks can be chosen for study that will have broad impact in a
      number of programmatic areas, as well as providing insights into underlying principals
      that drive forward basic science. </p>
      <p>Biology has undergone a revolution this century due to our increasingly sophisticated
      ability to manipulate and probe biomolecular structures in more complex systems. During
      the first half of the 20th century, molecular biology was concerned primarily with
      discovering biological macromolecules and determining their make up. In the 1950&#146;s,
      Watson and Crick deduced the structure of the DNA double helix. This discovery led to the
      deciphering of the genetic code and to the fundamental dogma of modern molecular biology;
      that genetic information is stored as the sequence of nucleic acid subunits in our DNA,
      translated by messenger RNA, and ultimately expressed in the linear sequence of amino
      acids in each protein molecule needed by a cell to carry out its functions. In the latter
      half of the 20th century we developed the ability to express almost any protein in simple
      host systems and to manipulate its amino acid sequence to modulate its functions. We also
      developed the technologies to study the structures of individual proteins and their
      complexes. With these data we began to understand basic biochemical mechanisms. We also
      came to understand that the dynamic fluctuations and conformational transitions within
      biomolecules are also key to understanding biological function. There are of the order of
      10<sup>5</sup> genes that code for specific proteins whose sequences are projected to be
      available from the Human Genome Project by the year 2005. As more genomes are sequenced we
      will acquire information about the gene functions. Gene expression and protein levels will
      be known in a variety of tissues, developmental, and disease states. Information on
      polymorphisms (different gene sequences that code for the same protein) will be available.
      We will gain new insights into disease and the new opportunities for biotechnology
      development will be profound. Continued advances, however, will depend upon an
      increasingly sophisticated understanding of how proteins, along with DNA and RNA, operate
      in complex molecular networks in a regulated manner to achieve coordinated function in
      response to a myriad of physiological stimuli. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IDENTIFICATION OF KEY AREAS</i></p>
      <p>In the near term, completion of the genome sequencing projects will require innovative
      sequencing technology that Los Alamos could play a role in developing. In the longer term,
      Los Alamos needs to be expanding its activities focused on the study of biomolecular
      structure and dynamics, biomolecular networks, and the biotechnology applications derived
      from them. With this foundation, Los Alamos can make key contributions in: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>1)<i> Biotechnology applications in national security, the environment, and economic
      competitiveness. </i></b>Our microbial and molecular bioscience capabilities combined with
      the gene sequence data from many microbial genomes and informatics capabilities are
      powerful tools for addressing a wide range of national priorities with biotechnology
      approaches. These approaches utilize the unique properties of biological molecules and/or
      organisms for technological applications. The study of microorganisms that survive in
      extreme environments holds great promise for further expanding the utility of biological
      systems in a wide variety of industrial and military situations. For example,
      understanding how thermophilic bacteria maintain functional proteins at high temperatures
      may reveal general rules that could be exploited in the design of more robust enzymes or
      receptor molecules. Areas in which biotechnology approaches are going to be important, and
      which are appropriate thrusts for Los Alamos include:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><b><i>Chemical and biological
        threat detection and intervention</i>.</b> Los Alamos is in a unique position to integrate
        chemistry, physics, and biotechnology approaches for addressing this problem. The
        development of biomolecular based sensors for threat detection, characterization, and
        disabling is an obvious initial focus area. </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>Bioremediation/global
        climate change.</b></i> The use of biological molecules or organisms to clean up soils
        contaminated by a variety of toxic agents, including those arising from activities within
        the DOE complex, is another obvious focus area. The microbial ecology of soils is
        extremely complex and poorly understood. It has been estimated that a typical gram of soil
        contains ten billion bacteria representing five thousand species of which less than 1%
        have ever been cultivated or characterized. Systematic study of the microbial ecology in
        soils will prove rewarding in establishing a scientific understanding of bioremediation.
        Biosystems are also efficient at converting CO<font size="1">2</font> into biomass. The
        engineering of plants to do this with even greater efficiency has huge potential for
        impacting global climate change. </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>Energy conversion,
        transport, and transduction.</b></i> Biological systems are remarkably efficient at
        capturing energy from the environment, then transporting and converting it to useful forms
        for cellular functions. Los Alamos has a strong fundamental program in this area which
        provides a foundation for biotechnology approaches to harvesting energy from the sun, or
        new ways of using renewable energy for processing of waste. </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>The development of new
        complex materials with novel functionalities. </b></i>Biological systems are unique in
        that their molecular systems can replicate, mutate, and evolve against environmental
        pressures such that they come up with novel functionalities that optimize their survival.
        The development of new materials based on biomolecular structures or principles, or
        biomolecules that can perform novel functions in extreme environments, for example, are
        frontiers that remain largely unexplored and which are likely to hold remarkable new
        resources. The multidisciplinary environment at Los Alamos is optimal for bringing
        together theory, computation, materials design, bioscience, and complex experimentation to
        open these frontiers. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>2) <i>Health effects research</i>.</b> The human health effects associated with
      production of pollutants within the DOE complex and by industry leads naturally to the
      need to study molecular networks mediating the recognition and repair of damaged DNA and
      regulation of cellular activities. These areas are appropriate for Los Alamos given our
      current capabilities, the fundamental importance of these systems in biology, and their
      significance for the DOE mission.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>3) <i>The origin of life.</i></b> With the deluge of sequence information coming
      available, a systematic comparison of the genomes of organisms nearest to the root of the
      phylogenetic tree of life may prove rewarding from the perspective of understanding the
      most fundamental question in biology: what is the origin of life? Thermophilic organisms
      are of interest in this regard as they originate from some of the deepest evolutionary
      branches of heterotrophic archaea and bacteria. It is possible that some non-culturable
      soil bacteria may be extremely primitive and knowledge of their genomes would provide
      information on the fundamental root of the origin of life. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IMPLEMENTATION</i></p>
      <p>Success in the key areas identified above requires integrated experimental and
      computational capabilities with diverse scientific approaches. The integration of cell and
      molecular biology with chemistry, physics, engineering, theory and computation will be
      essential to develop solutions to the very complex problems being addressed. In order to
      be a major player in this field, Los Alamos also will need to strengthen its technological
      base in:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Biological technologies for
        generating sequence or expression level mutants and assaying biological functions, and for
        providing the materials needed for structure and dynamics studies, with isotopic labeling
        where needed. </p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>X-ray and neutron techniques,
        NMR, as well as optical and laser spectroscopies to probe molecular structure - with the

        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font>Theoretical calculations of
        the free energy of interaction of the molecules in their environment. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Bioscience is a rapidly advancing and highly competitive area. In order to solve the
      complex problems we are challenged with in national security and the environment, Los
      Alamos must maintain a competitive basic bioscience program that can feed our applied
      research efforts as well as attract leaders in the field. We must cultivate, integrate,
      and add to our expertise and resources. A coordinated multiagency program is needed to
      realize the potential of Los Alamos&#146; impact in bioscience. We must aggressively
      explore where DOE and other agencies&#146; interests lie in a strong bioscience capability
      in the national defense laboratories. It is also critical that we encourage our scientists
      to compete vigorously for NIH funding, and we must evaluate the impact of our program
      using measures that include peer-reviewed publications and citations. The rigorous peer
      review proposal system of NIH is a critical quality control check for our bioscience
      activities, and the rapid expansion the field is undergoing means we must calibrate our
      accomplishments continuously against the wider national and international community. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>THE LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE/MISSION RELATEDNESS</i></p>
      <p>Los Alamos strengths in interdisciplinary research will be central to our
      competitiveness in the future of fundamental research on biological systems, biotechnology
      development and application, as well as health effects research. Our breadth of
      capabilities in molecular biology, cell biology, microbial biology, biochemistry,
      biophysics, theoretical, and computational biology provide us with the resources to
      address what will be some of the most challenging problems of the next century when
      national security will be focused more on health and environment issues. Los Alamos must
      foster the personnel and facilities to be a major player in this crucial area. </p>

      <p>Man-Machine Interface</font></b></p>
      <p>A computer does many things better than a human. Even the most gifted idiot savant
      cannot approach the machine's arithmetic speed, memory, or search abilities. Some things
      are done better by humans: the simple, nearly unconscious, tasks of visual awareness
      remain well out of the sphere of current computational engines. In some tasks, computers
      and humans are about equal. Deep Blue's defeat of Garry Kasparov was hardly a glorious
      victory for the machine --- the decision was 3 1/2 to 2 1/2.</p>
      <p>It is clear, however, that a great advantage will accrue as the human mind becomes more
      intimately connected to the machine. In the early days, humans had to pour over endless
      listings of &quot;zeros&quot; and &quot;ones&quot; to glean what the machine was telling
      them. Similarly, instructions to the machine could be accomplished only by the tedious
      wiring of panels. Soon after, computer memories grew large enough to store programs
      side-by-side with data, the process of loading the program was as easy as loading data.
      Similarly, output could be cast in easily intelligible units and symbols. Graphics
      revolutionized the interface for both input and output. Results of a calculation presented
      in graphical form rather than a list of numbers allowed humans to use their formidable
      powers of visualization to glean abstraction of magnitude, trend, slope, shape, and even
      certain kinds of homomorphism from the primitive string of bits. Similarly, with the
      advent of Visual Basic and other <i>gooeys</i> (Graphical User Interfaces), much of the
      input process has moved from the keyboard to the mouse.</p>
      <p>The other senses may be used as well to augment the man-machine interaction.
      Microcomputers already have audio output to supplement visual output. Three-dimensional
      displays and audio input are gaining in popularity. Virtual Reality, although still
      primitive and somewhat over-touted, is a technological imperative and will mature in the
      next decade. Although holographic displays with touch and kinesthetic-sense interaction
      will likely be first realized by the entertainment industry, they have enormous potential
      to facilitate rapid understanding of abstract scientific and mathematical results.</p>
      <p>Finally, the greatest power of the human mind is to conceptualize. Conceptualization is
      intimately related to consciousness and a range tenuous existential substance that science
      can neither measure nor detect. The infrequent human experience of epiphany is well beyond
      scientific description: it is easy to know both a theorem and its proof for many years
      before the day you realize what it is all about. This is ultimate understanding.</p>
      <p>Can we find ways for computers to relate concepts directly to humans without requiring
      laborious mentation or the agony of analysis? Similarly, can we find ways to relate
      concepts to computers without the tedium of explicit instruction?</p>
      <p>Improvements in the techniques of input and output through the familiar sensors and
      actuators of the human body may have a long way to go. Undoubtedly there are many
      innovations to be realized for expediting the process of transferring a concept from man
      to machine and vice versa.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we can develop algorithms to read `body language,' likely in concert with the
      dilation and constriction of the pupils and the furrow of the brow, to recognize the
      degree to which the user is understanding, and throttle or reformulate the
      information-rate or format accordingly.</p>
      <p>Ultimately we want to reach into the mind and extract or deposit concepts, bypassing
      the frailties and ambiguities of the sensory and muscular systems. Los Alamos already has
      a leg up on the problem, or at least a primal notion. The magnetoencephalography program,
      pioneered by Ed Flynn at Los Alamos, was in part motivated by the dream of controlling a
      machine directly with the mind. In a future era when physiology of the brain is so well
      understood as to make such control practical, perhaps we will find noninvasive ways of
      inputting the brain as well.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>THE LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE</i></p>
      <p>Los Alamos has a singularly pronounced profile in the history of computing as the
      science of computing grew-up with the hydrogen bomb. ASCI and the Delphi Program ensure
      that we will be at the forefront of supercomputing for the foreseeable future. Many of the
      machine-man interfaces were either invented at Los Alamos or used at Los Alamos early in
      their development, e.g. color graphics ~1965, holograms ~1973, multivoice audio ~1985. Los
      Alamos is a leader in magnetoencephalography, which may shape the far future of computer
      interfacing. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Microrobotics</b></font></p>
      <p>Micron-scale sensors and actuators are already under active development, and that
      nano-scale devices will follow is an article of faith. The impact of such devices will be
      felt in the national security and intelligence arena as well as in the commercial sector. </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most compelling need in the &quot;new world order&quot; is for an effective
      theater missile defense. A small but wealthy and fanatically ruled nation can acquire
      missiles with substantial range. Because chemical and biological agents can be dispensed
      in submunitions shortly after burnout, the offensive missile must be intercepted in boost
      phase. Thus only 30-90 seconds are available from launch-flash to intercept. Theater
      tactics at realistic ranges (200-500 km) mandate intercept velocities of about 10 km/sec.
      This high speed strongly suggests a large rocket in the role of interceptor. But the
      energy required to disrupt the offensive missile in boost phase is only about a megajoule,
      so the mass of the kill vehicle need be no more than 20 gm.</p>
      <p>If such a tiny vehicle could contain all the sensors, actuators, and data processing
      apparatus necessary for homing, the total mass of the interceptor could be fantastically
      small. With specific impulse of 300 sec, the idealized single-stage rocket equation would
      give a total mass of 8 kg. Realistic structure factors and multiple staging would still
      allow a mass under 50 kg. What a truly just nemesis for a 10-ton missile!</p>
      <p>The development of such a &quot;brilliant bullet&quot; would have far broader
      implications than theater missile defense. True surgical strikes may become possible,
      ending the ideal war with one shot. The technology may allow a broad range of military
      nanorobots, whose motility includes atmospheric hovering, jumping, and swimming. The
      opportunities for surveillance and intelligence gathering are manifest. The deterrence and
      concomitant opportunities for peaceful settlement of disputes are clear.</p>
      <p>DARPA has recently coined the term &quot;micrite&quot; for a microrobot with some
      self-organizing abilities strangely akin to the self-organizing abilities of certain
      subspecies of slime mold. Here are some words from an advertisement for a workshop at the
      end of April 1998.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>&quot;The workshop is to exchange information and opinions on the potential for
      developing sub- millimeter to sized micro-robots (&quot;Micrites&quot;) for use in
      penetrating and surveying hard targets.</p>
      <p>Hard targets are those entities and facilities that pose a threat to US National
      interest, but that with existing technology are extremely difficult or impossible to
      detect, localize and target. Hard targets include clandestine drug manufacturing
      facilities, terrorist strongholds and facilities employed in the creation of chemical,
      biological, or nuclear weapons of mass destruction.</p>
      <p>The micrites we envision are of the order of one cubic millimeter in total volume, self
      propelled, and are capable of carrying a sensor payload equal to approximately 10% of its
      total weight. Micrites will be capable of simple social behavior when activated: recognize
      activation, then propel to form an observable group. Large populations of micrites could
      be introduced into hard targets, carrying in exotic taggant materials that would allow the
      US to remotely identify the facilities, to differentiate them from civilian facilities and
      to target them with precision.</i></p>
      <p>This description is closely related to the &quot;floating fink:&quot; a concept
      emerging from a <i>Delphi </i>study at RAND about four years ago.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the area of greatest near-term benefit from these technological developments
      will be medicine. Microfabricated sensors for analysis of blood samples are nearing
      commercial application. Sensors that can continuously monitor various biochemical agents
      and can be fitted to the point of a hypodermic needle are presently under development.
      Sensors that can be swallowed to monitor and telemeter information about chemical balance
      in the gastrointestinal tract are already being used. No stretch of the imagination is
      required to believe that sensors could be developed to travel in the circulatory system,
      perhaps to lodge at specified locations and provide biochemical monitoring, perhaps to
      locate trouble spots, aneurisms in the brain, constricted blood vessels in the heart,
      cancer foci throughout the body.</p>
      <p>Once accepting these possibilities, it is not a much greater leap of the imagination to
      envision fitting these medical robots with actuators and tools so they could repair the
      aneurysm, chisel out the plaque, isolate the cancerous regions. Perhaps they could even
      diligently close off the blood supply to inoperable tumors. Nanorobotic surgery seems
      fantasy, but is far from being limited by physical laws. It is a logical extension of
      technological trends.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>THE LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE</i></p>
      <p>We have a very small microrobotics program in P-Division, which is oriented toward
      robots of relatively small scale (&lt;1 kg) with the intent that they will eventually be
      realized at the mm scale. We seem to have lost our edge in microlithography, a technology
      essential to construction of sensor, actuators, and logic for such critters. Perhaps our
      best bet is to form an alliance with Sandia for microfabrication.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font face="TIMES" size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Prosthesis</b></font></p>
      <p>The development of prosthetic devices for the benefit of the sensory-impaired certainly
      a grand challenge for cybernetic technology. A serviceable substitute for a
      &quot;seeing-eye dog&quot; appears to be within the scope of near-future technology:
      requiring development of sensory-fusion algorithms to interpret signals from an array of
      range finders, audio and video inputs, and perhaps detectors for electric and magnetic
      field anomalies. Research is currently in progress on embedding conductor matrices within
      sensor nerve fiber bundles to investigate prosthetic simulation of sight and hearing.</p>
      <p>Prosthesis is also province of nanofabrication technology. Researchers are already
      considering incorporating microsensors for glucose monitoring into an artificial pancreas.
      Hearing aids with spectral correction fitted to the auditory response of their owners are
      already available. That they could also be enhanced to produce feedback signals to
      damp-out the oscillations of tinnitus seems a straightforward task of microprocessor
      programming. Eyeglasses that change their focal length (according to range sensed by sonar
      or infrared) by either mechanical or electrical adjustment of a fluidic lens seem a
      developmental possibility. Cataract surgery has become so routine that the possibility of
      implanting an automatic focusing lens only touches on science fiction. In this
      application, a gelatinous lens focused by piezoelectric polymers seems a reasonable
      approach.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>THE LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE</i></p>
      <p>Los Alamos has a no particular charter to investigate &quot;cybernetic&quot;
      prosthesis, but we have many of the component technologies. It could possibly fall out of
      an enhanced program in microrobotics.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Biocomputers, Biosensors, Self-Wiring Computers</b></font></p>
      <p>This is an agglomeration of potential thrusts sharing a bio-imitative motivation.</p>
      <p>The brain is a very plastic and adaptive organ, and the nerve cells of which it is
      comprised are continually in the process of producing new connections through their axons
      and dendrites. This ability to self-organize and become greater than the sum of its parts
      shares a lot with the micrites discussed above, except this desired outcome would not be
      specified in advance. Rather some kind of reinforcement would be administered in the event
      of a favorable outcome. This notion shares many features of neural nets.</p>
      <p>The mammalian eye preprocesses much information within the retinal nerve tissue itself
      before sending the signals on to the brain. Can this function be mimicked in silicon?
      Surveillance cameras already do data compression so signals can be transmitted through
      ordinary telephone lines, a primitive form of predigestion for a specific purpose. The
      retinal nervous system, however, can distinguish moving horizontal and vertical lines, a
      form of perception, and perhaps more complex forms of perception occur in that vicinity as
      well.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>THE LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE</i></p>
      <p>Los Alamos has a no particular charter to investigate &quot;bio-imitative
      systems,&quot; but DARPA and other agencies are quickly discovering the importance of such
      research.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Robotic Sensing</b></font></p>
      <p>Mammals have a number of senses that serve them in a very useful manner. The
      construction of devices that include sophisticated interpretation of the input of the
      camera, the microphone etc has in fact been vital to mammals. Without them the value of
      their senses is very considerably reduced.</p>
      <p>Among the senses, first let us mention hearing. There is now commercially available
      speech recognition software, as in the &quot;you-talk, it-types&quot; category of
      programs. (These programs of course have no notion of meaning.) The ears however go beyond
      this very important ability. They can also perceive the direction of the sound, recognize
      non-verbal sounds, discern pitch, distinguish various multi-pitched sounds. The ear can
      easily distinguish a trumpet from a violin playing the same note, for example.</p>
      <p>Another sense is smell. There is progress, (aimed at drug smuggling intervention) in
      creating a mechanical nose. Here there are various sensors aimed at different categories
      of molecules, which describe a smell as a point in, say, 15 dimensional space. So far,
      dogs are better, but as I understand it the experimental mechanical noses are not too bad
      at the tasks they have been designed for. Taste, is a combination of smell and detection
      by the tongue of sweet, sour, bitter and salt. That is, smell is enhanced by a further
      four dimensional descriptor. Texture may play a role as well.</p>
      <p>The kinesthetic sense should be relatively simple to model (strain gauge). The sense of
      touch revealing hot and cold, pressure, injury, and texture, should be possible to model
      as well, however duplicating the density of these sensors might provide some problems.
      There are low technology means to implement the sense of up and down (plumb bob).</p>
      <p>Finally a most important sense is vision. It may well be that it is vision that is
      decisive in our conceptual organization of the world around us. Current simulations of
      vision are like the model where a little man inside the head looks at a TV screen that
      shows the input from the eye. The eye has (at least) four types of receptors (3 different
      types of cones corresponding to different colors of light, and also rods for seeing in
      dark places). There seem to be receptors that are directly sensitive to motion, and to
      edges oriented in different directions. Behind the retina are, we have been told, three
      layers of processing neurons which preprocess the incoming visual signal. The result of
      this preprocessing is sent to the brain via the optic nerve, where further interpretation
      is done. In addition, vision allows depth perception and automatic focusing by the lens on
      the retina. The construction of an artificial eye may be the most challenging. Input from
      a TV type camera or charge-coupled devices could be fed into a two dimensional array of
      microprocessors which would be cross connected to two more layers in to form of a neural
      network. From there a high capacity channel would transmit the information to an
      additional neural network for further processing, recognition and action decisions. Note
      that orientation and size do not impede the mammalian eye-brain system in recognition.
      Since many things in our environment are flexible, these distortions of the image are
      normally handled as well. Also there has to be feedback to focus the lens and there is
      additional information on the position of the two eyes to give depth perception.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE/MISSION RELATEDNESS</i></p>
      <p>Besides the aforementioned prosthetic work, the construction a mechanical eye, which
      has the ability to recognize various things, could be very helpful. For example, watching
      our Plutonium storage area is tedious and boring for people, but a suitable mechanical
      eye, which could tell the difference, say, between an intruder and errant tumbleweed,
      could be very helpful. Checking the printing of money at the bureau of printing and
      engraving for flaws is now done by people, but could be done by a mechanical eye. Proof
      reading type set material is another application. Watching a battlefield from a point too
      dangerous for soldiers, and sounding an alert when called for is another of numerous
      possibilities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="5"><b></p>
      <p>ENERGY </b></font></p>
      <p>Energy sources that are readily obtained, inexpensive and environmentally acceptable
      are key ingredients that affect the quality of life for all societies. As a leading
      technical resource for the country Los Alamos must make substantive contributions to
      ensure acceptable energy supplies. Our forte is certainly in the research and advanced
      concept arenas. We have been active in many aspects of the energy question. These have
      ranged from fission and fusion nuclear reactor designs through solar and fossil fuel
      programs. We have also been very active in environmental issues associated with energy
      running the gambit from site remediation through waste storage and transmutation. Through
      all of this the strength of Los Alamos has been the great technological diversity we bring
      to the problem. We have the expertise in all of the fundamental scientific disciplines and
      the multidisciplinary infrastructure that will be required to attack the wide range of
      energy related issues. Our emerging emphasis on advanced computing technology will give us
      a method to pull these fundamental studies into real world applications.</p>
      <p>Specific areas that are worthy of consideration for strategic investment include:
      nuclear approaches to energy self sufficiency, bioenergetics, and computation and modeling
      for energy and the environment.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Nuclear Approaches to Energy Self Sufficiency</b></font></p>
      <p>Increasing world energy demands will necessitate revitalization of the nuclear option.
      Los Alamos should position itself to assume a leadership role to increase public
      confidence in nuclear power. We should focus on achieving transparent nuclear reactor
      safety and waste management protocols that reduce waste volume and activity, and minimize
      the accumulation of fissionable materials of purity appropriate to clandestine use.
      Accelerator Transmutation of Waste and Accelerator-Based Fission Reactors are two
      approaches. Los Alamos can further underwrite its leadership position in nuclear power by
      sponsoring international conferences that chronicle progress and change in nuclear safety,
      environmental issues, and economics.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>
      <p align="justify">Accelerator Transmutation of Waste (ATW).</b> S</i>tudies at Los
      Alamos, and elsewhere, suggest that Accelerator-Driven Transmutation of Waste prior to
      repository storage is a promising approach that may lead to substantial economic and
      environmental benefits. Analysis suggests that a commercial nuclear economy that includes
      ATW treatment of spent fuel will release waste to repositories that decays in 300 years to
      a level of radioactivity and radiotoxicity that requires 100,000 years without ATW.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p align="justify">IMPLEMENTATION</i></p>
      <p>Los Alamos, and other research institutions, have made substantial progress in
      answering criticisms of ATW and now promote the technical superiority of pre-repository
      processing from a strong analytical base. The Laboratory is fortunate to have many of the
      necessary components for broadly based research programs to demonstrate ATW technologies.
      Among them are unrivaled resources in spent fuel treatment, materials science, computer
      modeling of nuclear systems, and an operating high-power linear accelerator. At a beam
      power of nearly 1 MW, LANSCE can be commissioned as a 1/20 to 1/40 scale prototype of the
      first ATW processing plant. </p>

      <p align="justify">Accelerator-Based Fission Reactors.</b></i> <font face="TIMES">Conventional

      <p align="justify">IMPLEMENTATION</i></p>
      <p>Conventional thermal-neutron reactors using non-highly fissile fuel will not operate in

      non-enriched U as a nuclear fuel. Neutrons could be produced by a proton linear
      accelerator of similar design to that required for accelerator tritium production or
      accelerator transmutation of waste. Further work can be done to evaluate this concept with
      an initial goal to produce a conceptual design that allows a cost comparison of an
      accelerator-driven non highly fissile reactor fueled system with conventional and breeder
      reactors, including cost savings for fuel enrichment and nuclear waste management. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Bioenergetics</b></font></p>
      <p>Most human activity is powered by biological energy sources. These activities include
      the life processes themselves, which are driven entirely by bioenergetics, while many of
      our industrialized functions such as transportation, communications, and manufacturing
      rely primarily on fossil fuels as their energy source. The biological processes themselves
      are models of clean and efficient energy production and conversion. However, the use of
      biologically generated energy sources by humans (that is, primarily, the production and
      consumption of fossil fuels) is subject to many serious and well-documented problems
      including exhaustibility of resources, social and environmental acceptability of
      production, and pollution associated with consumption. A major challenge and opportunity
      is to use the lessons provided by bioenergetics (the production and conversion of energy
      in life processes) to conceptualize clean and efficient new energy sources to power the
      industrialized functions of human activity. The next challenge will be to design practical
      devices that are based on these concepts and capable of meeting large-scale energy
      demands.</p>
      <p>Modern technology, well developed at Los Alamos, puts these goals within reach. This
      technology is of three types. First, the biological systems need to be characterized well
      enough so that the mechanisms of production and storage of energy are understood. This
      involves significant efforts in structural biology and in functional characterization by
      spectroscopic and computational approaches. Second, the biological system needs to be
      rationalized (or simplified) so that the essential features (in terms of practical
      devices) of the energy production and conversion processes are identified and the
      &quot;parasitic&quot; processes which are necessary for life functions but not for
      practical applications are discarded. This problem is seen primarily as a
      computer-modeling problem. Third, a practical energy conversion device must be produced.
      This accomplishment requires bringing together the techniques of molecular biology,
      genetic engineering, synthetic chemistry, and materials science to realize the concepts
      developed in the first two steps. The ability to focus very sophisticated and diverse
      modern technologies on a problem of this magnitude, with the objective of producing end
      products that meet national needs in national security through energy independence, is
      uniquely available at Los Alamos.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font size="4"><b></p>
      <p>Computation and Experiment -- Energy and the Environment</b></font></p>
      <p>The Laboratory's capabilities in modeling and computation can help provide solutions
      for national problems involving energy and the environment in the next twenty years. As
      the worldwide demands for energy continue to grow pressures to reduce the amounts of
      pollutants and greenhouse gases from these technologies will intensify. Similarly
      experimental capabilities can also make substantial contributions to these areas.
      Underscoring the difficulties the U.S. and the world will face in maintaining energy usage
      for a growing economy while reducing the adverse effects on the environment are the
      commitments of the industrialized countries made to the Kyoto Protocols to reduce
      emissions of gases contributing to global warming below projected levels. Several areas
      are outlined below in which the Laboratory could play an even stronger role in the coming
      years, and strategies in pursuing such a path are briefly discussed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>1) <i>Climate modeling.</b> </i>Modeling of the earth's climate through atmospheric and
      ocean simulations represents the most prominent area at present where computational
      activities are playing an important role in the international debate on global warming.
      There remain, however, large uncertainties in the interpretation of the observational
      record as well as limitations in the current atmospheric and ocean models currently in
      use. These issues make a compelling case for increased computational efforts to achieve
      greater spatial resolution as well as more reliable predictions over longer time periods.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>2) <i>Combustion.</b> </i>Approximately 90 percent of the manmade CO<font size="1">2</font>
      released into the environment each year comes from the burning of fossil fuels, hence
      accounting for the bulk of man-made contributions to global warming gases. The results of
      improved modeling of combustion processes could lead to greater efficiencies and reduced
      environmental impact from fossil energy usage. The Laboratory has an established track
      record in the development of computational techniques in hydrodynamics for combustion
      applications and in the dissemination of these codes to the automotive and other
      communities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>3) <i>Catalysis and separations.</b> </i>The transformation of chemical feedstocks into
      commercially useful products such as polymers, the refining of petroleum feedstocks to
      fuels, and the treatment of automotive exhaust emissions all involve the use of catalysts,
      which carry out chemical transformations without being consumed in the process. These
      economically important processes have achieved increased emphasis in the chemical
      industry, where these processes are being carried out with less energy consumption and
      fewer environmentally undesirable byproducts such as greenhouse gases. Processes involving
      catalysts have typically been modeled at the bulk level by chemical engineering
      approaches. The development of improved catalysts will involve modeling efforts on a
      variety of levels as well as coupling with a strong experimental effort in
      characterization and screening of catalytic materials.</p>
      <p>Gas and liquid phase separations constitutes another area of technological significance
      where large amounts of energy are currently required. These issues assume even larger
      importance in cases involving global warming gases, which one does not want to discharge
      into the environment. Modeling activities can address important problems such as the
      design of selective membranes, predictions of thermodynamic properties of multi-component
      systems, and unraveling the mechanisms of transport in liquid media and in membranes.</p>

      involve either the use of electricity (produced by a power plant) or the use of fossil
      fuels with the concomitant CO<font size="1">2</font> release. It is thermodynamically more
      efficient to use the heat from the power plant directly to produce hydrogen rather than

      <p>by pyrochemical methods from the heat of an appropriately designed ultra-safe,
      accelerator-based fission reactor. The work to be done here involves the refinement of the

      <p>IMPLEMENTATION </i></p>
      <p>The Laboratory already has significant activities in several of the areas identified
      above, often involving collaborations with other national laboratories and universities.
      The DOE Strategic Simulation Plan would build upon the current ASCI infrastructure with
      applications targeted towards non-defense problems in global warming, combustion, and
      other important technological areas such as materials. While the Laboratory has very
      credible competence in the energy and environmental sector, because it is outside our
      traditional defense mission we will face stiff competition from other national
      laboratories and universities for new programs and initiatives in these areas. It is
      therefore important to initiate partnerships with those laboratories whose expertise
      complements our own, and to define clearly a limited set out of the many potential targets
      of opportunity in which to invest Laboratory resources in the future.</p>

      <p>MATERIALS</b></font></p>
      <p>Materials research and technology has historically been a strong element of the
      Laboratory&#146;s technology base. The nuclear weapons program drove the need for
      expertise in metallurgy, low-temperature/condensed-matter physics, materials under extreme
      conditions, polymer composites, and high explosives. As our mission has broadened to
      include aspects of energy, non-nuclear defense, and industrial competitiveness, expertise
      has grown to include ceramics, highly-correlated electronic materials, materials for
      sensor applications, fiber composites, electronic and nonlinear optical materials, and,
      recently, biomimetic and biomolecular materials. The materials community at Los Alamos, in
      addition to providing an extremely broad and deep competency, is a fertile arena for
      multi-organizational research at the interface between traditional disciplines of
      ceramics, metallurgy, solid-state physics, materials chemistry, polymer science, and
      biology.</p>
      <p>The early focus on weapons materials and classified research has evolved into a more
      open materials research effort, resulting in integration of the Laboratory&#146;s
      materials scientists with the broader national and international community. Today, our
      materials community has several world-class efforts and overall strong collaborations with
      researchers from industry, universities and other national laboratories. As the
      Laboratory's expertise and interests in materials research have grown, there has been a
      precipitous decline in the level of effort of large industrial materials research
      laboratories such as IBM, Bell Labs, Exxon, and US Steel. The broad materials research
      base and the culture of working on large complex problems utilizing a cross-disciplinary
      approach positions Los Alamos to assume a national leadership role in materials research.
      By the same token, advances in materials synthesis and characterization techniques provide
      great opportunity to address current Laboratory problems in weapons science, threat
      reduction, and energy. The scientific strengths in materials research are augmented by a
      number of important research facilities including large ones such as LANSCE and the
      National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and smaller facilities such as the Ion Beam
      Materials Laboratory, the electron-beam microscopy facility, and the ultra-fast
      spectroscopy laboratory.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IDENTIFICATION OF KEY AREAS</i></p>
      <p>Materials issues are ubiquitous in the Laboratory&#146;s missions from nuclear weapons
      and threat reduction to fundamental science. Nuclear-weapons programs provided a strong
      focus for materials research in areas such as plutonium structure, materials under extreme
      conditions, and high explosives. Nevertheless, our evolving mission and the emergence of
      new national security issues will drive the future evolution of materials research. We
      discuss the future of materials research from the combined perspectives of programmatic
      areas and traditional materials research disciplines.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>1)<i> Materials for Energy</i>.</b> The increasing demand for energy and the call for
      reductions in fossil-fuel emissions, stemming from concerns over global warming, offer a
      wide range of opportunity for materials development. High-temperature materials such as
      metal/ceramic composites and advanced intermetallics/ceramics are needed to increase the
      energy efficiency of engines and enable new high-temperature industrial processing. Energy
      conservation and space-based applications suggest the need for low-density structural
      materials such as alloys of magnesium, a very abundant lightweight metal. Energy
      efficiency will also drive development of longer-lasting materials that can be recycled.</p>
      <p>In addition to using energy more efficiently, there are options for alternative sources
      of energy. A possibility to replace the carbon-cycle economy of fossil fuels is a
      hydrogen-based fuel system in which the safe and economic storage of hydrogen will be a
      major issue. Recent advances in non-silicon based materials have demonstrated high
      efficiency for electron-hole pair separation and subsequent energy conversion and storage
      through water dissociation. Fuel cells also play an important role in energy conversion,
      as do alternatives such as novel battery technology.</p>
      <p>Although nuclear energy has been in a decline in the United States for decades,
      near-term conditions may signal a reversal of that trend. Accordingly, there is a need for
      a new generation of nuclear reactors that have been redesigned to optimize efficiency and
      safety while minimizing waste. Of more pressing concern is the ability to treat/store
      nuclear fuel waste. The ATW Program is one attempt to deal with these problems. Paramount
      in such programs is the development of new materials for radioactive and corrosive
      environments.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>2) <i>Electronic and Optical Materials</i>.</b> From flat panel displays and electronic
      processing devices to fiber-optic communication and optical data storage, electronic and
      optical materials have and will continue to fuel the technological innovations of our
      time. Further, these materials open up exciting new frontiers in fundamental understanding
      of the coupling of electronic and magnetic excitations with lattice and optical processes.
      Understanding and controlling competing interactions and cooperative phenomena on multiple
      length scales pose outstanding scientific challenges, crucial to producing novel materials
      properties with technological functionality. Recent examples include colossal magneto
      resistance materials with potential magnetic-recording application and coherent coupling
      of vortex excitations in high-temperature superconductors which limits the critical
      currents in practical superconductors.</p>
      <p>Organic electronic and optical materials are a rapidly developing field where increased<b>
      </b>understanding can have important impact on key technological areas including
      information display and optical communications. Major advantages of organic materials are
      their ability to be processed economically in large area, the tunability of their
      electronic and optical properties, and their flexibility in materials and device design.
      As in other electronic materials, the theme of competing interactions provides a unity at
      the fundamental physics level among these classes of materials.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>3) <i>Biomimetic and Biomolecular Materials</i>.</b> An exciting area for future
      materials research is programmable and/or adaptive materials. It is likely that such novel
      materials will emerge at the interface between traditional disciplines of life and
      physical sciences. One area is biomolecular materials that build from and incorporate
      biological molecules. An example is biomineralization where systems develop intricate
      high-strength structures through the growth of metastable inorganic phases that are
      controlled by proteins. By isolating the genes that code for these proteins, scientists
      are beginning to use them to grow artificial organic-inorganic hybrid structures.</p>
      <p>Biomimetic materials are materials that mimic biological function. For example,
      biological systems convert energy by coupling photochemical or redox processes to the
      creation of a proton gradient. If such coupling mechanisms can be determined and mimicked
      in synthetic materials, it may be possible to take energy from arbitrary sources and
      convert it to a standard form. Another example of biomimetic materials is artificial
      membranes that incorporate recognition molecules selected from biomolecular combinatorial
      libraries. These functional membranes can be made to mimic stages in olfaction to produce
      highly selective elements for chemical and biological sensors.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>4) <i>Materials &amp; Nuclear Weapons</i>.</b> An important materials expertise
      essential for the nuclear weapons program is the study of materials under extreme
      conditions, e.g. shock compression, ultra-high temperatures and pressures, dynamic stress,
      and high magnetic fields. Such studies provide key feedback for a fundamental
      understanding of materials by probing interatomic potentials at ranges and energy levels
      far from normal conditions, thereby assisting in establishing accurate electronic and
      molecular-dynamic models. In addition, new materials-related problems have arisen in the
      context of SBSS, three of which we mention here: the evaluation of materials aging
      phenomena in stockpile weapons systems, the remanufacture of weapons materials and
      components, and the incorporation of materials-related properties (equation of state) and
      behavior into weapons computer codes. Examples include aging effects in high explosives,
      new processes for plutonium-pit remanufacturing, and modeling of the deformation behavior
      of materials under extreme conditions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IMPLEMENTATION</i></p>
      <p>To maintain existing areas of materials research while at the same time developing new
      promising directions will require coordination of diverse efforts, integration of
      materials synthesis and characterization with simulation, and theory, and some stability
      in core funding of outstanding materials programs as well as of important facilities.
      Specifically Los Alamos should:</p>

        electronic transport measurements, high static and dynamic pressure, and a wide variety of

        program coupled to the capabilities, facilities can be more of a detriment than an asset

      </blockquote>
      <p>Materials research at Los Alamos is extremely diverse and we have not been able to
      address all the exciting science and technology represented. Many of the issues that are
      needed to ensure the continuing overall health of materials research and some of the
      opportunities for future growth have been presented.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE/MISSION RELATEDNESS</i></p>
      <p>Los Alamos needs to capitalize on its unique combination of facilities and scientific
      researchers to develop and maintain a world class materials research effort in focused
      areas. We already have some large facilities that are central to materials research:
      neutron scattering at LANSCE, high field pulsed magnets at the NHMFL, and large-scale
      scientific computing. Neutron scattering and computing is also key facilities for nuclear
      weapons work. Materials research can benefit tremendously from a synergy of effort that
      cross cuts major facilities, interdisciplinary research, and complex problems. The role of
      materials across the Laboratory remains vital to nuclear weapon and threat reduction as
      well as furthering fundamental science and bringing the latest and best ideas, techniques,
      and people to the Lab to provide a firm foundation for programmatic efforts in national
      security.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font face="TIMES" size="5"><b></p>
      <p>NATIONAL SECURITY</b></font></p>
      <p>Since the establishment of the Manhattan Project in 1943 to address the urgent World
      War II national defense requirement, Los Alamos has continued its preeminent role and
      responsibility in the U.S. nuclear weapon program. In addition, we have engaged in a broad
      spectrum of activities supporting the U.S. defense establishment in other, non-nuclear
      areas. Approximately three-fourths of the Laboratory&#146;s $1.2 billion annual budget is
      devoted to these activities, in the Nuclear Weapons and the Nonproliferation and
      International Security Programs, under the responsibility of the Associate Laboratory
      Directors for Nuclear Weapons and for Threat Reduction, respectively.</p>
      <p>A principal activity of the Laboratory is to maintain the enduring nuclear weapons
      stockpile, those strategic nuclear weapons for which Los Alamos has development,
      surveillance, and maintenance responsibility. This task is accomplished using a
      broad-based, science-based, stockpile stewardship program comprised of physics,
      computational modeling, engineering, and materials science. An associated program supports
      national objectives in arms control, treaty verification, nonproliferation, intelligence
      assessment, emergency response to nuclear incidents, production, control, and disposition
      of nuclear materials, manufacture and dismantlement of nuclear weapons, and nuclear waste
      management.</p>
      <p>In the post-Cold War environment many of the DoD analysis centers and
      &quot;Beltway&quot; think-tanks have either gone out of business or greatly reduced their
      work on nuclear weapons systems and applications. As a consequence Los Alamos needs to
      return to a more visible leadership role.</p>
      <p>An over-riding concept is reducing the global nuclear danger. The Laboratory must
      continually demonstrate credibility and leadership in these areas. Minimizing
      technological surprises is an important aspect. The shift from proof testing with nuclear
      experiments at the Nevada Test Site, to the current state of reliance on archival data,
      numerical computations, non-nuclear experiments and analyses, and professional expertise,
      is providing both challenges and opportunities. This is the cornerstone, and should be
      handled as such.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IDENTIFICATION OF KEY AREAS</i></p>
      <p>We now list and briefly describe some of the over-riding national defense programs,
      requirements, and opportunities. We attempt to describe problem or opportunity areas, and
      suggest possible courses of action or laboratory capabilities that can be brought to bear
      in those areas. However, because of the limited resources, and space, available to this
      report, a more detailed &quot;matrix&quot; of capabilities to apply against particular
      tasks was not attempted. National Security is such a pervasive effort at LANL that the
      Fellows are currently undertaking more detailed studies on two aspects: the &quot;Science
      Based Stockpile Stewardship&quot; program and on the &quot;Impact of Technology
      Developments on the Next Generation of Strategic Forces &#150; 2010-2025 Time Frame&quot;.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>1)<i> Nuclear weapons program and the enduring stockpile. </i></b>The Laboratory&#146;s
      stockpile management program is well founded and broadly based. It covers areas of physics
      design, large-scale calculations, engineering design, testing, and manufacturing,
      materials studies, component aging, and experiment execution and diagnostics. For some
      areas of supporting activities that need attention, LDRD has taken up some of the slack.
      Overall difficulties are the general lack of depth in professional staff and funding
      constraints that limit studies on new works, processes, etc.</p>
      <p>The over-riding problem for our nuclear weapons program, in a nutshell, is this: For
      years Los Alamos and Livermore adopted basically an engineering approach (in the best
      sense of the word) to developing nuclear weapons. Starting with previous test results
      modest changes were made and the resultant new design tested. In some fashion or another
      calculations were made to fit the new results (if they did not naturally do so) and
      another step was taken. The result is that predictive capability (i.e. physics, chemistry,
      etc models) developed only within this restricted scenario and reached its own equilibrium
      with respect to other activities. Without testing this equilibrium is inadequate to fill
      the void. So what is the problem?</p>
      <p>The problem is that things that never entered into the historical design process begin
      to emerge as potential problems to worry about. The theorist can rather quickly come up
      with a list of 100 things that may go wrong, never mind that 90 of them are likely red
      herrings. Different people then seize on their favorite topic(s) to determine what is
      important to do.</p>
      <p>Our stockpile will have to be rebuilt after some period of time. The two outstanding
      problems, most broadly speaking, are 1) what are the effects of aging on performance (i.e.
      when do we have to rebuild) and 2) what are the effects of rebuild on performance. As long
      as our stockpile is &quot;comfortably tolerant&quot; of &quot;small&quot; variations there
      may be no problems at all. However, remanufactured pits will be made by different
      processes. The grain size will be somewhat different, changing material strength. The
      impurities will be somewhat different, changing high-strain-rate flow properties. To deal
      with such issues we need physical models that describe accurately what we have now (better
      than currently exist) so that variations can be evaluated. This model
      development/improvement will have to be accompanied with an appropriate experimental
      program to keep the theory honest. This partnership will be especially important for
      plutonium work. We need a vigorous program to learn as much as possible about the
      properties of Pu alloys, for example</p>
      <p>Numerical hydrodynamics is the platform that all our other physics packages operate
      from. To the extent it is in error, this error is propagated to the other disciplines. The
      best approach to this problem is a contentious subject, but the need find the best is
      critical. We believe data base activities such as Equation of State, Opacities, and
      Nuclear cross-section work will be even more critical in the future than they are today
      but they face a budgetary fight for survival. Managers cannot believe that we have not
      already measured and evaluated all the nuclear cross-sections we will ever need. </p>
      <p>ASCI is great. But we need to accompany the increase in computing power with a
      commensurate improvement in physical models (of the type described above for material
      behavior for instance). There is some movement in this direction but it is a struggle.
      Validation of ASCI codes is sorely lacking. </p>
      <p>Maintenance and enhancement of the Laboratory&#146;s capabilities requires attention to
      such areas as material properties, including aging effects; new, safer, more energetic
      explosives; operation of weapons on-the-margin; development of robust, non-sensitive
      components or designs; etc. </p>
      <p>Techniques are being developed, such as proton radiography, that have the potential to
      measure the effects of aging on weapons with enough precision to predict performance using
      hydrodynamic tests. If successful, these techniques will enhance the ability to respond to
      questions of stockpile assurance in the absence of nuclear testing. As new diagnostic
      techniques are developed, there are potential proliferation implications, although the
      absence of benchmarked nuclear test data may limit the value to proliferants.</p>
      <p>The extension of nuclear weapon technologies to weapon effects phenomena and
      applications is weak and could be strengthened to provide a more forward looking approach,
      especially for the next generation of nuclear warheads and delivery systems.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>2) <i>WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) Proliferation.</i></b> It has been an
      overarching priority of national policy since 1945 to prevent nuclear attack against U.S.
      soil. To the nuclear threat we must now add biological and chemical weapons of mass
      destruction. These weapons could kill thousands to millions of Americans at a single blow,
      while changing for all time our democratic society. In fact, our overwhelming military
      superiority invites covert attack, because covert attack is one of the few options
      remaining to a determined adversary.</p>
      <p>Deterrence of threats and mitigation of consequences to domestic and international
      security are addressed in the three principal focus areas of nonproliferation and arms
      control, technology development, and international technology monitoring and assessment.
      Important capabilities to support this area are developed via NASA (National Aeronautics
      and Space Agency) space research. </p>
      <p>Monitoring and assisting in control of large inventories of plutonium, enriched
      uranium, and alternate nuclear materials, remains a major commitment, as does support of
      monitoring and assessments of actual or possible foreign nuclear weapon-related
      activities. Response capabilities related to nuclear incidents and accidents fill a
      national need.</p>
      <p>Chemical and biological weapons, both in a battlefield venue and in the hands of
      terrorist or other directed attacks on the U.S., require continued development of
      detection sensors, of fast-response assessments, and of efficient and economical means of
      mitigation. Particularly important are covert and standoff techniques that allow early
      warning of proliferant activities in denied areas.</p>
      <p>If proliferants acquire WMD, we must minimize the chance of their use, and mitigate the
      consequences if indeed used. Improving our defense at the country&#146;s borders, by
      advanced sensors and processing to detect smuggling, is part of the response to
      proliferation. So is containment of an attack by civil defense, which includes threat
      prediction and mitigation. Attribution of the source is essential to any follow-up,
      whether military or prosecutorial. Laboratory capabilities that bear on these problems
      include space sciences, mass spectrometry and other laboratory forensics, information
      science, remote sensing, nuclear and other sensors, modeling and simulation, especially
      the prediction of threat vectors, and systems analysis. Robotic and biological science
      will make an increasing contribution tot his mission. Intelligence analysis, as always,
      remains critical to the prediction and attribution of threats.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>3) <i>Missile Defense.</i> </b>Tactical or theater missile defense (TMD) has been long
      recognized as a defense requirement. Since the end of the Cold War, defense of the
      continental U.S. has been dismissed as non-time urgent, until the recent Rumsfeld
      committee&#146;s assessment that non-superpower ballistic missiles may be developed or
      acquired sooner than otherwise anticipated. The laboratory should continue to support
      missile defense in threat analysis, launch detection, and determining lethality
      requirements and developing specialized warheads. Critical to this effort will be our
      capabilities in nuclear weapons, modeling and simulation, sensors, and space engineering.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>4) <i>Advanced Conventional Weapons (ACWs).</i> </b>ACWs are potentially available to
      industrial powers, where they may already be under development and also to developing or
      third world states, by means of indigenous development, technology transfer, or outright
      sales. In order for U.S. and Allied Forces to be prepared for such encounters, the
      Laboratory should increase its monitoring, evaluation, and technical assessment of such
      capabilities. The potential application of such technologies in attacks against the U.S.
      domestic infrastructure should be evaluated and responses addressed. Of particular but
      non-exclusive concern are HPM (high power microwave) and RF (radiofrequency) sources.
      Advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial vehicles could also be configured to carry
      nuclear warheads or WMDs.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>5) <i>Conventional war fighting</i>. </b>Laboratory technologies have the potential of
      increasing weapon effectiveness, in developing precision munitions and precision delivery
      systems, in target identification, in battlefield management and assessments, in high
      speed data processing, in developing interdiction methods to preempt adversary actions,
      etc. These capabilities will be critical in the asymmetric conflicts that the U.S. will
      face. We have overwhelming technological superiority, but are seldom as motivated as our
      adversaries, so we need to apply force precisely and remotely with minimal or no risk of
      casualties to U.S., Allied, or civilian forces.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>6) <i>Infrastructure protection.</i> </b>The U.S. infrastructure, including utilities,
      transportation networks, and information nodes and connections, is disturbingly vulnerable
      to attack. This is true of both DOE facilities and the nation in general. What can go
      wrong was illustrated in the Southern Hemisphere last year, during which the main
      electrical power supply was lost for Auckland, New Zealand&#146;s commercial center; the
      domestic water supply to Sydney, Australia was contaminated by giardia; and the natural
      gas supply to Melbourne failed for several weeks.</p>
      <p>Such events have large economic and security impacts. The best tool against such events
      is prevention, guided by detailed systems studies made possible by large-scale
      simulations. The computer side of the threat is particularly compelling, and lends itself
      to offensive and defensive actions derived from Laboratory computer capabilities. </p>
      <p>The focus of ASCI thus far has been dominated by the nuclear weapons program. The goals
      of the projected enhanced performance and the related complexities of operation have
      applications to missions of NSA. The Laboratory&#146;s ASCI experience could be integrated
      and utilized to enhance the future posture of NSA in their programs.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>7) <i>Environmental security.</i> </b>Resource limits, especially food supplies, energy
      and water availability, have the potential of leading to international instability and
      conflict. Alleviation of these problems can assist in preserving U.S. national security.
      Capabilities that are critical to these problems include large-scale environmental
      modeling and remote sensing.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>8) <i>Underground facilities.</i> </b>During the Gulf War, and again in Afghanistan and
      Sudan, the U.S. demonstrated an overwhelming capability to locate and destroy surface
      targets. Adversaries are responding by going underground, especially as regards their most
      critical and dangerous facilities: command and control, ballistic missiles, and all
      aspects of WMD. To a large extent, we neither can find, characterize, nor neutralize these
      facilities. Improved tools are needed, and the Laboratory can make a significant
      contribution. Capabilities important to this mission include remote sensing, earth science
      (especially seismic sensing), information science, advanced sensors, and detailed
      computational simulations. </p>

      <p>IMPLEMENTATION</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>Customers. </b></i></p>
      <p>Our customer base is limited to the defense establishment, supporting agencies, and
      national policy makers. Among these are DoD and OSD, e.g., STRATCOM, USASMDC, Joint
      Chiefs, Navy, Army, Air Force, DTRA, DIA; CIA, e.g., OTI, NPC; DOE, DP, IN, and NN; DOS;
      NSA; FBI; NRO. Collaboration as opposed to competition is a recurrent issue, particularly
      in times of diminishing resources.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>
      <p>Infrastructure needs</b></i></p>
      <p>Maintaining competencies and capabilities has been recognized as critical. Mentoring
      and training of personnel, and establishment of new experimental facilities, is being
      addressed as part of the core weapons program; however, small-scale experiments are
      suffering. LDRD projects make limited but important contributions.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i><b><p>A. Personnel </p>
        </b></i><p>Key to long-term success is developing trained, competent personnel. This
        requires continual effort, in recruiting new degreed scientific and technical personnel,
        and technical support staff, and in upgrading the competency of the staff. The X-Division
        TITANS course, to develop qualified, &quot;certified,&quot; designers, is an excellent
        example of such an approach. Comparable professional development in other
        defense-associated areas should be developed. The nominal 20% time available for
        self-directed, but relevant, work and studies attempted in X-Division is a good principle,
        potentially providing an incentive to broaden experience and also providing an opportunity
        to do interesting and challenging non-directed work.</p>
        <p>Professional development must be encouraged. Although the new Performance Appraisal
        (PA) process specifically addresses this area, results in the past have been decidedly
        mixed. An overall, Laboratory-wide, viewpoint must be established, in developing and
        employing standards. The conflict between highly individualized performance evaluations
        vs. the necessity for collaboration and teamwork, with perhaps &quot;lower
        importance&quot; work assignments, is an issue.</p>
        <p>More advantage in national defense programs should be taken of Laboratory retirees. The
        &quot;Associate,&quot; &quot;Affiliate,&quot; or &quot;Guest Scientist&quot; status is
        being applied inconsistently. We should assume that Group and Division line management
        recognize the desirability of bringing on staff new personnel &#150; Nuclear Weapon
        Programs annual sponsorship of four post-doc fellowships is a promising means of
        recruiting, and that retirees are only a short-term solution to staffing needs. However, a
        more accepting attitude on the part of Division and Program Office Management would allow
        a better response (more timely and more accurate work) to Laboratory programmatic
        requirements, by using retirees. The position of Laboratory HR (Human Resources) requiring
        that retirees, who have been retired for more than one year, be accepted only as
        &quot;contractor&quot; personnel shows no understanding of working-level operations and
        should be rescinded. Would an &quot;emeritus&quot; category finesse this problem?</p>
        <i><b><p>B. Facilities</p>
        </b></i><p>Weapon-associated facilities and operations, such as ASCI (Accelerated
        Strategic Computing Initiative), DARHT (Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test)
        facility, the Atlas high-energy pulsed power source, LANSCE (Los Alamos Neutron Science
        Center), the ARIES (Advanced Recovery and Integrated [plutonium] Extraction System)
        process, the expansion of TA-55 for plutonium processing, and APT (Accelerator Production
        of Tritium) and ATW (Accelerator Transmutation of Waste) studies, are the most obvious
        examples of the Laboratory&#146;s commitment to develop and implement new technologies in
        support of defense needs, and are to be commended.</p>
        <p>However, general laboratory facilities and infrastructure are aging and not being
        replaced. Others are being decommissioned, in part because of &quot;space taxes&quot; that
        are perceived to be excessive and which cannot be supported by programmatic cost codes.
        These issues must be addressed; they exacerbate the problem of promoting computation over
        experimentation, at the expense of validation of calculations.</p>

      <p>LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE/MISSION RELATEDNESS</i></p>
      <p>Since its inception, the <i>raison d&#146;être</i> for Los Alamos has been nuclear
      weapons, from invention, to engineering for deployment, to maintenance of the stockpile in
      the absence of full testing. In the coming years, new threats to security will require
      responses based upon a variety of scientific capabilities. To fulfil our national mission
      we must have the capabilities needed to defend against biological and chemical agents,
      conventional weapons and missiles, attacks against our environment and infrastructure,
      including computer networks. Our computational capabilities and diversity of scientific
      disciplines provide us with significant advantages to take on these challenges, although
      there are areas we will need to strengthen. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<font face="TIMES" size="5"><b></p>
      <p>NEUTRONS</b></font></p>
      <p>An important component of the research program at Los Alamos has been centered on the
      use of high-intensity linear accelerators and the science they support. A major component
      of the national nuclear physics research program was centered at LAMPF, using the 800 MeV,
      1 mA proton linac to produce pions, muons, and neutrinos. This accelerator now is used in
      conjunction with the Proton Storage Ring (PSR) to produce spallation neutrons for
      condensed matter science and defense programs applications at the Los Alamos Neutron
      Science Center (LANSCE). The Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) project is currently
      using the linac as a test bed to demonstrate technical feasibility of this approach in
      support of the nuclear stockpile needs of the country. The linac is also being used to
      develop proton radiography for stockpile stewardship. In addition, the linac provides the
      basis for a first-class research program in fundamental neutron and neutrino nuclear
      physics. A number of other high-intensity accelerator designs have been developed in
      support of the national fusion program, neutral particle beams for national defense, the
      Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), and presently for the National Spallation Neutron
      Source. Plans are being developed to use the LANSCE accelerator in applications of the
      accelerator transmutation of waste (ATW) and possibly accelerator production of energy.
      The materials science, nuclear physics, and weapons physics communities have made great
      use of the LAMPF/LANSCE accelerator. The research program using this accelerator has led
      to new radiographic techniques to study dynamic physics phenomena, advanced
      instrumentation to handle extremely high data rates, and new discoveries in nuclear
      science. The accelerator complex has served as a magnet facility to attract outstanding
      researchers to Los Alamos. We fully expect that the complex will continue to be a magnet
      facility in the future with an even broader research program. </p>
      <p>Neutrinos have had an anomalous history at Los Alamos. They are indubitably part of the
      basic research agenda. The initial effort in this area came from the realization that
      nuclear weapons might be such a prolific source of neutrinos and that they might afford a
      chance for their direct detection. This effort moved to the use of a reactor devoted to
      defense concerns and the neutrino was observed there by a Los Alamos group directly for
      the first time. Since neutrinos interact so weakly, the LANSCE accelerator with the
      highest intensity anywhere offered opportunities that were unparalleled for neutrino
      studies. The sign of the interference term between W and Z was established here, a
      fundamental part of the verification of the standard electroweak theory. Los Alamos is
      also a source of expertise in the handling of radioactive materials which was definitely a
      factor in the experiment to attempt to see evidence of neutrino mass from tritium decay.
      At the time, this limit on the electron neutrino mass was the best in the world. More
      recently, the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) at LANSCE has seen evidence for
      flavor changing neutrino oscillations, which when verified, will have profound effect on
      the view of the world of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. A follow up
      experiment is approved at Fermilab, BooNE, a collaboration of premier US university groups
      as well as Fermilab itself to attempt to verify the LSND result and to provide detailed
      and precise measurements of the parameters. Los Alamos too has had seminal impact on the
      solar neutrino problem with the SAGE collaboration and now with the US-Canadian
      collaboration SNO. This collaboration is virtually certain to have a major impact on the
      solar neutrino problem.</p>
      <p>There has been a continuing tradition of using high-intensity accelerators for both
      programmatic and basic research efforts. One example of this synergy is the use of the
      LANSCE accelerator for APT, neutron scattering at the Manuel Lujan Neutron Scattering
      Center, the Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) facility, proton radiography, neutrino physics
      (LSND), and fundamental nuclear physics with cold and ultra-cold neutrons. It is essential
      to maintain this type of synergy between the programmatic and basic research efforts at
      Los Alamos. The current push by Senator Domenici for increased use of nuclear energy in
      the United States provides a good example of how energy policy, national security, and
      high intensity accelerators (through ATW and the accelerator production of energy) are
      brought together as part of our mission. Los Alamos is a leader in the design,
      construction, and operation of high-intensity accelerators. It is important to retain this
      capability and to expand its applications into new research areas. Neutron science plays
      an important role in this future, as it is certain that no research reactor with higher
      fluxes than available at present will be built in the foreseeable future. Thus, spallation
      neutron sources must meet the needs of research requiring intense neutron beams or intense
      neutron fluxes. Los Alamos will be able to play a key role in this future only if the
      MLSNC becomes a viable national user facility and only if the expertise in linac design at
      LANSCE is retained and nourished. </p>
      <p>Another important area that has developed largely due to the nuclear physics program at
      Los Alamos has been the development of large, sophisticated detectors, intelligent data
      acquisition preprocessing, pattern recognition algorithms, and transfer, handling, and
      analysis of immense amounts of data. The expertise in detector technology in the pion
      physics program at LAMPF led directly to the development of proton radiography. This
      technique offers that ability to provide good contrast between low Z materials inside high
      Z materials (such as within the core of a plutonium pit) with high resolution (&lt; mm)
      with good time resolution (nsec) at repetition rates of an image every few tens of
      microseconds. Thus, one can study dynamic processes such as the shock wave propagating
      through a piece of high explosive which is inside a high Z material. The defense program
      has rated this as a &quot;must have&quot; capability and a strong R&amp;D effort using the
      LANSCE and AGS (at Brookhaven) accelerators is underway. Los Alamos is also the lead
      laboratory for construction of the silicon micro vertex detector in the Phoenix experiment
      that is under construction for use at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
      Brookhaven. This detector has positioning tolerances of a few microns, has &gt; 10,000
      silicon strips, must withstand intense radiation fields, and the data acquisition system
      must handle multiplicities in excess of 20,000 particles per heavy ion collision. Novel
      detectors based on a variety of detection techniques are under development at the
      Laboratory within the field of nuclear science. It seems likely that many of the
      techniques that have been developed in the nuclear physics program could be of benefit to
      a wider range of research fields including stockpile stewardship, threat reduction, and
      potential applications in medicine and industry. </p>
      <p>Nuclear science depends upon the ability to sift signals out of large and noisy data
      sets. In some applications, this feat requires development of preprocessing electronics to
      be able to handle high data rates in which it is essential to reduce the data prior to
      recording without loss of the desired information. In other applications, the analysis of
      large data sets in nuclear and particle physics is often related to the ability to
      recognize patterns. This need is also present in many other fields of research at Los
      Alamos. There is currently an effort in advanced computing to develop models and make
      quantitative predictions using very large sets of input data. However, we feel this is
      only the tip of the iceberg and that a concerted and coherent effort at the Laboratory to
      pursue pattern recognition development would be of direct benefit to both programmatic and
      basic research efforts. In this case, it is often necessary to develop the ability to
      reduce massive amounts of multidimensional data to a form that can be readily interpreted
      by the human mind. The human mind is still our best tool for finding order within apparent
      chaos, but one needs to develop the data reduction and analysis efforts to make optimal
      use of it&#146;s capabilities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IDENTIFICATION OF KEY AREAS</i></p>
      <p>We see four areas in which support is required in order to have Los Alamos become a
      world center for neutron science:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>1) <i>Development, construction, and operation of high intensity accelerators.</i></b>
      The present LANSCE accelerator complex currently provides the basis for a broad research
      program in both programmatic and basic research fields. It clearly will continue to be an
      important component of the program for the next decade. Beyond LANSCE, efforts to develop
      high intensity accelerators with possibly higher energy beams are an important component.
      This would allow advances in both programmatic applications (such as APT and ATW) and in
      basic research as well (neutron scattering and nuclear physics).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>2)</b> <i><b>Progress in nuclear science requires not only high intensity accelerators,
      but also the presence of a vital research program that is central to the mission of the
      Laboratory.</b><u> </u></i>Foremost among these is the use of spallation neutrons for
      research in programmatic fields. Specific examples are neutron scattering to study aging
      effects in nuclear weapons, neutron capture measurements on unstable radchem detector
      isotopes, and the ability to do dynamic experiments with techniques like neutron resonance
      spectroscopy which provides a means to measures temperatures generated by the shock waves
      in a high explosive. Another area of vital concern is the development of programs linked
      to the increased use of nuclear energy in this country. Research programs such as ATW can
      play a crucial role in supporting the Nation&#146;s energy reserves. In order for this to
      succeed, it is absolutely essential that LANSCE be a success and become a national center
      for a wide range of neutron physics.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>3)</b> <i><b>The development of radiography plays a special role in the future research
      program at the Laboratory.</b></i> Proton radiography can address uniquely a number of
      weapons physics issues making this technology a high priority for the weapons program.
      However, other techniques (including gamma ray and neutron radiography) also serve
      important and complementary roles in addressing issues ranging from weapons physics to
      medical technology and industrial applications. It is important that we have a coherent
      and broad effort in radiography in the future.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>4)</b> <i><b>Advanced instrumentation plays a critical role in the future science
      program at the Laboratory.</b></i> A great deal of instrumentation has been developed
      within the nuclear and particle physics fields at the Laboratory. Significant advances
      have been made in handling vast amounts of data, both in terms of hardware preprocessing
      of data as well as analysis techniques. This type of technology development can have
      potential impact on many applied and basic research efforts within the Laboratory. One of
      the challenges the Laboratory faces in mapping out a bright scientific future is the
      ability to integrate research developments from one field (such as nuclear physics) to
      other fields (such as neutron scattering and medical technology). The transfer of
      technology from nuclear science to other fields can provide one means of meeting this
      challenge.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
      <p>5) <i>Neutrino physics.</i> </b>Neutrino physics with it&#146;s technical complexity,
      use of techniques which are at the limit of the nuclear and particle physics art, offers
      an opportunity for Los Alamos. We can claim that not only do we bring technical excellence
      to bear on the problems we deal with but we can also have substantial impact in areas that
      are of preeminent interest in the scientific world at large. Excellence is our primary
      scientific product, and the establishment of quality should be seized whenever a clear
      opportunity exists. Neutrino Physics has been such an opportunity and it should continue. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>IMPLEMENTATION</i></p>
      <p>Neutron science covers a very wide range of research fields at the Laboratory. It is a
      field in which the future health of both the national security program and basic research
      are intertwined. A first-class research effort in neutron science can, and should,
      strengthen the research capabilities within a wide range of other research areas at the
      Laboratory. In order to have a healthy and vital Laboratory 10 &#150; 20 years in the
      future, several steps must be taken.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>LANSCE, and in
        particular, the MLNSC must be a national success.</b></i> We believe that it is critical
        in the short term to resolve issues at LANSCE that may prevent achieving this goal.</p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>Over the next 10 years,
        new programs such as ATW must be strongly supported</b>.</i><b> </b>The development of new
        capabilities, both in terms of new high intensity accelerators and new technologies in
        nuclear science, must be a priority if neutron science is to be a central component of the
        Laboratory.</p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>Over the longer run, it
        is important to provide a solid base of stable support research within the area of nuclear
        science</b></i> (which includes neutron scattering and related science, radiography, and
        nuclear and particle physics). The developments that come from this area are likely not
        only to help keep Los Alamos as a world leader in basic science, but also has direct (and
        likely unexpected) benefits to many other areas of research at the Laboratory.</p>
        <font face="Symbol"><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> </font><i><b>It is important to the
        long-term vitality of neutron science that the programmatic and basic research efforts be
        closely linked and fully integrated.</b> </i>There has been some progress made in this
        respect, but such efforts are somewhat random and sporadic. It would be of real benefit to
        the Laboratory to have better communication and interactions between staff in the
        programmatic and basic research efforts. There is interest on the part of a number of the
        researchers in neutron science to close this gap and the Laboratory should undertake to
        drive these connections. One means might be to form a neutron science weapons working
        group.</p>
        <i><b><p><font face="Symbol">·</font> The neutrino physics program must be supported.</b></i>
        The follow up experiment to LSND, BooNE, at Fermilab has no immediate competitor, and the
        return to Los Alamos for a successful verification is immense. In SNO Los Alamos has been
        a key player in this work from the start. They are identified with the neutral current
        part of this work which is likely to have dramatic impact on the solar neutrino problem
        and hence the whole view of particle and astrophysics.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The first component carrying out these steps is to integrate LANSCE into the national
      user community. This requires that reliable beam be available both at the MLNSC and for
      other applications such as APT. The Laboratory should provide assistance is solving
      regulatory problems which impede meeting this goal. The Laboratory also needs to strive to
      meet the needs and desires of the LANSCE users. A closer coupling to leading figures in
      the neutron science community would be valuable in this respect. A second important
      component in carrying out these steps is to provide discretionary support (either LDRD or
      program development funds) in support of neutron science. Obviously, one needs to strive
      for stable DOE funding that will be sufficient to meet the goals discussed above, but
      discretionary funds are also essential in laying the groundwork for future efforts.
      Finally, the Laboratory needs to take specific actions to bring the basic research and
      programmatic side closer together. If management makes the commitment to take these
      actions and carries them through to completion, we believe that we will indeed be able to
      become THE Neutron Laboratory as one vital component of the Laboratory&#146;s mission.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
      <p>LOS ALAMOS ADVANTAGE/MISSION RELATEDNESS</i></p>
      <p>The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is the flagship research facility at Los
      Alamos. Its neutron beams and new instruments have the potential for creating strong links
      to academic and industrial science in a variety of research areas - structural biology,
      condensed matter physics, accelerator science, nuclear physics, materials science, isotope
      production, and more. LANSCE is also strongly connected to our future in national defense
      areas - accelerator production of tritium, neutron and proton radiography, advanced
      neutron cross section measurements (use of unstable targets), and accelerator boosted
      transmutation and energy production. By 2000 Los Alamos will be in position to become a
      center of excellence in areas of science related to LANSCE capabilities provided that
      LANSCE has become the right kind of facility. Accelerator transmutation of waste and
      accelerator-boosted subcritical power generation are good ideas. Their associated complex
      technical and political issues are fertile ground for imaginative thinking about the
      future (Energy Subsection). Los Alamos has the broad range of knowledge required to make
      intellectually credible contributions to these nuclear issues. </p>
