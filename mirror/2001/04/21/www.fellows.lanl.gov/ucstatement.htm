<b><p><br>I.	PURPOSE OF FELLOWS' STATEMENT ON UNIVERSITY 
OF CALIFORNIA CONTRACT</p></b>


            <p>Los Alamos National 
Laboratory (LANL) exists to assure, through 
              science 
and technology, the national security of the United States. 
 
To accomplish this purpose, LANL must produce high-quality, 
multidisciplinary, 
              classified and unclassified 
scientific research and development 
              for solving 
complex problems of national importance. In the past, 
 
the LANL Fellows* have strongly supported the Department of Energy's 

              (DOE) selection of the University of California (UC) 
as the LANL 
              contractor.<sup>1</sup> At this critical 
time in LANL's history, 
              the LANL Fellows wish to 
reaffirm their support for UC&#146;s continued 
 
scientific management of the Laboratory and for the importance of 
 
its nurturing environment for scientific 
excellence.</p>


<b><p><br>II.	LANL MISSIONS REQUIRE THE BEST 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE POSSIBLE</p>


</b><p>LANL has missions in 
the areas of nuclear stockpile stewardship, threat reduction, and 
strategic and supporting research. To fulfill these missions, LANL 
must have world-class competency in a number of diverse scientific 
disciplines. LANL must bring together the best people and finest 
equipment in an interactive research environment focused on finding 
solutions to these national challenges. The continuous association 
with UC has enabled LANL to achieve both goals: to be a world leader 
in diversified sciences and to be able to recognize, meet, and solve 
relevant national challenges, ranging from small, specialized 
problems to large-scale interdisciplinary projects. (The first such 
large-scale interdisciplinary project was the Manhattan 
Project.)</p>

<b><p><br>III.	GREAT SCIENCE DEMANDS GREAT 
PEOPLE</p>

</b><p>LANL's mission and programs require great science, 
and the quality of its science depends directly on the quality of its 
people.  For over 50 years, LANL has benefited from having 
world-renowned scientists on its staff (see the Appendix). In many 
cases, these scientists chose to work at Los Alamos because of the 
prestigious employment with UC, the nation's largest and most 
acclaimed public research institution. The UC employee benefits 
package is another important element when attempting to hire the best 
and brightest in a highly competitive marketplace. LANL attracts, 
hires, and retains superior scientific staff for three major reasons: 
LANL's excellent reputation as a place where one can do cutting-edge 
science, the strategic national importance of our work, and the 
prestige and integrity of the University of California. These UC 
advantages are vitally important today and will remain so in the 
future.</p>


<b><p><br>IV.	SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE REQUIRES 
EXCHANGES OF IDEAS AND PEER REVIEW</p>


</b><p>Scientific excellence 
and integrity require an interactive workplace and collegial 
atmosphere to allow creative thought and free-flowing exchange of 
new, sometimes controversial, ideas. LANL staff must be able to 
interact with colleagues worldwide at conferences and through journal 
publications that provide important peer reviews and stimulate new 
concepts in our unclassified science (that often later finds 
application to our classified work). Consistent with requirements of 
security, similar exchange of ideas and peer review are no less 
important to the creativity of the community of weapons scientists at 
the national laboratories. UC has always demanded scientific 
integrity, which is absolutely crucial for LANL to be successful in 
its national security missions. UC has supported the Laboratory's 
efforts to strive for the ultimate science-based workplace. Under UC 
leadership, LANL has thrived for over 50 
years.</p>


<b><p><br>V.	LANL FEDERAL CONTRACT MUST HAVE A 
SCIENCE-IN-NATIONAL-SERVICE FOCUS</p>

</b><p>Recognized worldwide 
for its excellence in scientific research, UC also has extensive 
experience overseeing large laboratories including Los Alamos, 
Lawrence Livermore, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. For 
more than half a century, UC has worked intensively with Los Alamos 
and understands the scope and special nature of our work.  UC 
performs its oversight of LANL as a public service, helping the 
Laboratory provide science while protecting the information it 
applies to our nation&#146;s security. UC has worked with LANL to 
improve operations and ensure a safe and secure workplace, and it has 
been responsive to DOE's changing requirements.  UC uses results of 
performance-based, peer-reviewed science management in its oversight 
of LANL.</p>


<p>UC influences science and operations at LANL in the 
following important ways.  The LANL Director is an officer of UC, 
similar to the Chancellor of a UC campus, and reports to the UC 
President. At five-year intervals, a board appointed by the UC 
President reviews the performance of the Laboratory Director.  The UC 
President's Council on the National Laboratories has been established 
by UC to advise the president on all aspects of UC's management 
responsibilities. UC faculty is represented on external committees 
appointed by the Laboratory Director to review the technical 
divisions at LANL at least annually. The President's Council provides 
an overall assessment of LANL's performance based on the reviews of 
the technical divisions. In addition, the council's National Security 
Panel visits LANL and Livermore annually to review the work supported 
by DOE defense programs and the non-proliferation and national 
security programs.  Some of the fee paid to UC to manage LANL is 
returned to LANL and used, at the discretion of the Laboratory 
Director, to support joint research between LANL staff and faculty at 
the UC campuses and the four New Mexico research universities.  The 
strong science-in-national-service focus of UC has enabled LANL to 
develop the multidisciplinary science base needed to carry out its 
missions.</p>


<b><p><br>VI.	57 YEARS OF LANL SCIENCE AND 
TECHNOLOGY WITH UC</p>


</b><p>As our contractor, UC has demanded 
all the requirements for great science: excellent staff, collegial 
work atmosphere, essential equipment, and experienced peer review. 
Consequently, LANL is one of the most highly acclaimed scientific 
organizations in the world.  As an indicator of our scientific 
excellence, peer review, and dissemination of unclassified 
information, LANL has more journal publications since 1977 than any 
other national laboratory.<sup>2</sup> These publications report 
important scientific developments in the areas of national security, 
energy technology, high-speed computing, and fundamental physics, 
chemistry, and life sciences.  Some of these accomplishments are 
listed in the Appendix.</p>


<b><p><br>VII.	FUTURE SCIENCE 
REQUIREMENTS FOR LANL</p>


</b><p>LANL's mission in weapons science 
is to certify indefinitely the performance, reliability, and safety 
of the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. 
This mission requires the development of new analytical and 
experimental techniques and the training of a new cadre of 
scientists, engineers, and technicians.  In addition to this 
challenge, LANL provides technological solutions to a wide range of 
equally daunting international issues such as non-proliferation, 
counter-terrorism, bio-remediation and mitigation, energy, and 
environmental security.  To fulfill these defense and societal roles, 
LANL must continue to be a multidisciplinary laboratory at the 
forefront of science.  The solutions to these national problems, 
which may have political implications, absolutely require the highest 
standards of scientific integrity.  To date, LANL has accomplished 
these missions by virtue of its strong relationship with 
UC.</p>


<b><p><br>VIII.	POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON LANL SCIENCE IF DOE 
CANCELS THE UC CONTRACT</p>


</b><p>Since the Laboratory's inception 
during the Manhattan Project, UC has managed the Laboratory as a 
public service. UC's values, reputation, infrastructure, and 
experience have served the nation and LANL well.  UC has fostered a 
professional atmosphere at LANL and nurtured an environment that is 
essential for innovation and productivity in both research and 
development.  We believe that the level of excellence, integrity, and 
respect brought to LANL by our UC association could not be matched by 
any other potential contractor.  If the UC contract were to be 
terminated, it would diminish the quality of the LANL R&amp;D efforts 
to the detriment of our national missions.  It would lead to both a 
short and long term attrition of our laboratory scientists and 
engineers and greatly impede our ability to attract the best and 
brightest of future 
generations.</p>


<b><p><br>IX.	CONCLUSIONS</p>


</b><p>We can 
continue to satisfy LANL's evolving missions only if we maintain and 
develop our world-class science capability in many disciplines.  We 
must have the best people, equipment, and workplace atmosphere to 
continue our scientific and technological accomplishments.  The 
association with UC has been and continues to be critical for the 
success of LANL's scientific endeavors.  In our opinion, there exists 
no institution better qualified to oversee LANL's scientific 
activities than the University of California.</p>

<p>Our Laboratory 
Director Dr. John Browne has said, &quot;The challenge today and in the 
coming decade to ensure the safety and reliability of the US nuclear 
deterrent without nuclear testing is as great as any faced in our 
history.  The University's role is as important now as ever.&quot;**

<b><p>APPENDIX: Some Notable LANL 
Scientific and Engineering Accomplishments from 
1943-2000:<sup>3,4</sup></p>
</b><p><b>Nuclear Weapons:</b> LANL has 
designed, tested, and certified the majority of weapons in the 
nation's nuclear stockpile since 1945. LANL developed the first 
nuclear weapons (1945); demonstrated the ignition of thermonuclear 
fuel (1951); tested the first thermonuclear weapon (1952); developed 
VELA satellite verification of atmospheric test-ban treaty (1963); 
designed PHERMEX (1963) and DARHT (1999) x-ray radiography facilities 
and proton radiography (1995) for the study of the dynamics of dense 
matter; used the high-intensity LAMPF proton accelerator for nuclear 
weapons studies (1972); developed insensitive high explosives (1974); 
and developed CORRTEX to verify underground yields 
(1985).</p>

<p><b>Science and Engineering:</b> LANL constructed the 
world's third nuclear reactor (1944) and the first plutonium reactor 
(1946); produced the first liquefied helium-3 (1948); developed the 
Monte-Carlo (1947) and Sn discrete ordinates method (1953) for 
solving radiation transport computations; created the Metropolis 
Monte Carlo algorithm (1953); built and tested nuclear powered 
rockets (1955); detected the neutrino (1956); demonstrated the first 
thermonuclear plasma in laboratory fusion studies (1958); used 
plutonium-238 as a space-power source (1959); developed the Stretch 
computer in collaboration with IBM (1961); invented heat pipe 
technology (1963); produced direct conversion of nuclear to 
electrical power by high-temperature thermionic conversion (1967); 
built the ultra-high temperature nuclear reactor (1969); used the 
high-intensity LAMPF proton accelerator for nuclear studies (1972); 
began hot dry rock program (1978); discovered the universality of 
chaos in deterministic systems (1979);  began the operation the 
national database GenBank for nucleic-acid (1982); discovered 
heavy-fermion superconductors (1982); invented thermoacoustic heat 
engines and refrigerators (1983); published the first edition of 
nucleotide-sequence data for HIV samples (1987); created a neutral 
particle beam in space (1989); produced the first widely-used 
electronic e-print archive (1991);  manufactured high-temperature 
superconducting wire (1995); demonstrated quantum cryptography 
through 40 km of fiber optic cable for the first time (1997); and 
demonstrated the feasibility of sending a quantum cryptography key 
pad to an earth-orbiting satellite (1999).</p>

<p>These 
accomplishments have been possible at LANL only because we have had a 
long and illustrious history of having outstanding scientific 
personnel. Seven Nobel Laureates have been technically associated 
with the Laboratory.  In the combined National Academies of Sciences 
and Engineering, we have a total of 11 members - more than any other 
national laboratory.  Many Los Alamos scientists have been honored by 
selection as Fellows of their scientific and professional societies 
including American Physical Society, American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 
American Geophysical Union, American Nuclear Society, the Minerals, 
Metals and Materials Society, etc. In addition, numerous LANL 
scientists have been recipients of prestigious awards for outstanding 
achievement as presented by major national and international 
scientific and professional societies.  This includes more national 
R&amp;D 100 winners (63) in the last twelve years than any other 
institution.<sup>5</sup> This legacy of scientific excellence is the 
backbone of LANL and provides the bridge to the future that will 
enable us to solve the emerging technological problems of our 
society.</p>
