<font color=red>W</font>orld <font color=red>o</font>f <font color=red>H</font>ell rooting sites in the year 2001. Looking for new members, if you're interested, <a href="mailto:woh@yours.com">mail us asap</a>. We're looking for coders.. no script kiddies please =)<br><br>
<b>Okay, so CNet was compromised.</b> ph33r me =)<br><br>
<b>pr0phet</b> - we respect you. Your one of the few (others include Quit Crew and SilverLords) who is not an IIS kiddie. We respect you for that. It would be so easy for you to just go over to IIS and start wooping some hp.com and aol.com domains. But you've kept with *nix. Nice one =)<br>
We are defacing IIS, sure. But they're *only* big domains. We _can_ and have hit Linux, just I'd rather be hitting big companies on IIS than momandpop.com on *nix. That's just who I am. A media wh0re, heh.<br><br>

<b><u>Note to mirinda</u></b>: we received your mail, but you used an incorrect email address so we could not reply. Either mail us with a correct address, or check your /memoserv on BrasNet. Thanks :)
