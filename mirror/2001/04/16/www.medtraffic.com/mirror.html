        <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>(Please read this to
        see the whole story of what happened in Kashmir...)</b></font></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">1947, when
        India was partitioned into two and Pakistan was created, the people of
        Kashmir&nbsp; - a territory in between the borders of Pakistan and India
        (officially known as Jammu and Kashmir) - demanded that they be allowed
        to join Pakistan.&nbsp; Since Kashmir was a majority Muslim state, and
        since Pakistan was to become a Muslim nation, it made sense.&nbsp; Not
        to India however.&nbsp; <b>India immediately dispatched troops all over
        Kashmir to suppress the will and voice of the Kashmiri people.</b>&nbsp;
        When the people of Kashmir rebelled against this repression, India's
        first prime minister Jawaharial Nehru promised the citizens of Kashmir
        that they would choose their own fate.&nbsp; <b>Nehru assured the
        Kashmiri people that they would be allowed to do what they wanted.&nbsp;
        Nehru claimed that the sole criteria for Kashmir would be the
        &quot;wishes of the Kashmiri people.&quot;</b>&nbsp; But soon after
        United Nations Resolutions were passed, <b>Nehru flagrantly violated his
        pledge by illegally passing laws that incorporated the state of Jammu
        and Kashmir into the Indian union, thus betraying the will of the
        Kashmiri people that he had sworn to honor</b>, and also contradicting
        U.N. Security Council Resolutions that had been passed before.&nbsp; By
        taking advantage of a puppet government in Kashmir,<b> India made it
        appear so as Kashmir was ready to join India, but the people of Kashmir
        were never even consulted about this, nor were they given a choice.</b>&nbsp;
        And so thus India illegally occupied most of Kashmir for decades, and
        persecuted, tortured, and made life excessively harsh for the vast
        majority Muslim population of Kashmir...<b>until 1989, when the people
        of Jammu and Kashmir rose up to fight for freedom against an Indian
        oppressor, a country that had for years denied them their rightful independence.</b>&nbsp;
        The popular revolt for liberation increased day by day in Kashmir, and
        when India realized that the voice of the determined Kashmiri people
        could not be silenced, it decided to significantly increase its troop
        presence in the territories. 60,000 Indian Troops were deployed in
        Indian-occupied Kashmir, the largest troop presence in any area of the
        world.&nbsp;<b> In order to destroy the Kashmiri freedom struggle once
        and forever, the Indian army went on a rampage of destruction in
        Kashmir, killing, raping, pillaging, looting, torturing, and plundering
        the Kashmiri Muslims, and continues to do that to this day.&nbsp; Over 65,000 Kashmiris
        have been killed by the Indian force since 1989.  Several thousands of young girls and
        women have been raped, molested, and tortured.  Hundreds of schools and hospitals have
        been torched by the Indian Army, the Kashmiri children, doctors, and patients, burned alive
        with them. Harrassment, crack-downs, rape, torment,  indiscriminate murder,
        and arbitrary arrests are a few of the harsh everyday affairs which the Kashmiri people
        are victim to by the Indian Army. This same kind of stuff happens
        everyday to the Palestinians as well by the Israeli army, as well as to
        the Chechen people at the hands of corrupted Russian
        soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
