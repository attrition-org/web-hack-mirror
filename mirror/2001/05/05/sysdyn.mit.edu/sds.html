It is run solely on a volunteer basis by practitioners of systemdynamics in academics and industry. With members in over 35 countries,the Society provides a forum in which researchers can keep up-to-date withapplications, methodologies, and tools.<P>The System Dynamics Society is responsible for the publication of <I>TheSystem Dynamics Review</I>, a refereed journal containing articles on methodologyand application. The International Conference of the System Dynamics Societyis held annually and will be in Quebec, Canada in 1998. [<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/SD96/home.html">VirtualProceedings</A> for the 1996 conference are also available.] This meetingbrings together people from around the world and is arranged to give broadexposure to the local activities of the area hosting it. A President'sletter provides an informal forum to bring members up-to-date on societyactivities and business.<P>In addition to The System Dynamics Review and its annual conferences,the Society maintains supplies of past conference proceedings and otherimportant publications in the field. An electronic bibliography of workdone in the field is maintained and updated annually. The "Beer Game,"a production distribution board game illustrating important principlesrelating local decision making to system behavior is available along withvideo taped instructional material.<P>The System Dynamics Society has their own <A HREF="http://www.albany.edu/cpr/sds/">homepage</A><BR><HR><CENTER><a href="home.html">MIT SDEP Home</A> | <a href="help.html">Help</A>| <a href="feedback.html">Comments</A> | <a href="index.html">Index</A></CENTER><HR><ADDRESS>Page address: http://sysdyn.mit.edu/sds.html</ADDRESS><BR>Created: Jan 18, 1996<BR>Updated: Jan 12, 2000<BR>Page maintained by <a href="feedback.html">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</A><BR>Comments and questions are always welcome.</BODY></HTML>
