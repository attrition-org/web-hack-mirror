To view the documents you will haveto do three things:<OL><LI><A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">Downloadthe <B>free</B> Reader</A> You will have to download the Adobe AcrobatReader from the Adobe site. It is available for Windows, DOS, Macintosh,SunSPARC, HP, SGI, and AIX machines.</LI><LI>Configure the Reader as a "helper application" for your web browser. Youshould set up your web browser so that it recognizes Acrobat documentswhen you download them. Thus your web browser will know where to find yourreader when you want to view pdf documents on the web.</LI><LI><B>Download the document</B>. Having set up your browser and reader, allyou have to do is download the PDF document you want to read from our site.</LI></OL>If, after following these instructions, you are still having trouble, youcan contact us at <A HREF="mailto:webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</A><BR><HR><A NAME="enclosures"></A><H2>Email Enclosures</H2>The way to enclose a file into a mail message may differ depending on yourcomputer and software you are using. Here are some instructions:<H3>If you are using Eudora mailer</H3>Regardless of whether you are using Eudora or Eudora Pro for either a PCor a Macintosh, you can use <B>Attach Document...</B> option in the <B>Message</B>menu. After that, you have to select the file with the model you are submitting,and then send the mail. You can include your additional information inyour mail message before you send it.<P>In your <B>Settings...</B> dialog box (invoked from <B>Special</B> menu),in the <B>Attachments</B> setting pane, you can select one of several encodingschemes (uuencoding, MIME, binhex, or others). It is not important whichencoding scheme you are using. However, if you are using a Macintosh, werecommend you check <B>Always include Macintosh information</B> checkboxbefore sending the mail with the attached file.<H3>If you are using TechMail mailer for the Macintosh</H3>In this case, you can use <B>Enclose Binhex...</B> option from <B>Message</B>menu. After selecting the file with the model you are submitting, you cansubmit your model, with the additional information in the body of the mailmessage.<H3>If you are using TechMail mailer for PC</H3>Unfortunately, TechMail for PCs doesn't have a way to enclose attachmentsinto mail messages. You will have to use another program to encode yourmessage in either MIME or uuencode format. We will soon provide a utilityprogram for encoding on our server.<P>Once you have encoded the file you want to submit, you can send theencoded file from TechMail by choosing <B>Insert File...</B> from the <B>Message</B>menu. You should insert your additional information at the very beginningof your message, before the encoded file.<H3>If you are using Netscape Mail</H3>If you are using Netscape Mail, you can attach files by selecting <B>Attach</B>button (in some versions of Netscape, this button has a paperclip drawnon its face) and selecting the file. Please make sure that you attach afile, and not a URL, and that you send the file <B>As is</B> (or as <B>Source</B>,in some versions of Netscape). After you write your additional commentsin the body of the mail message, you can submit the message to us.<H3>If you have a dial-up account on a UNIX system, and are using a terminal-stylemailer</H3>In this case, your options will vary from situation to situation. Pleasecontact your system administrator for details. In general, you will havefirst to upload the model to your account, and then send it using a UNIXmailer, such as Pine or Elm. Your system administrator or help desk willbe able to provide you with the necessary information.<H3>If you are using an Intenet provider's services, and are not using oneof the above mailers</H3>Please ask your Internet provider's technical support for details aboutsending enclosures in email. As soon as we manage to get some trial accountswith various Internet providers, we shall put the provider-specific instructionson this page.<H3>If you are not using any of the above</H3>Please use your software manuals and technical support. Should that fail,feel free to send an email to <A HREF="mailto:rm-help@sysdyn.mit.edu">rm-help@sysdyn.mit.edu</A>, and we shall attemp to help you to the best of our abilities.<BR><A NAME="BinHex"></A><HR><H2>BinHex and .SEA Documents</H2>In order to provide access to our files for the largest possible rangeof internet users, we have made all compressed archives for the Macintoshavailable as binhex files. These are text files which can be decoded intobinary files once they have been loaded on your machine. After a BinHexfile has been decoded, you will have either the document file that yourequested, or, a .sea file which contains the files that you requested.".sea" files are self extracting archives. This means that several fileshave been compressed together into this archive for convenience. To decompressa ".sea" file, simply double click on it and it will do the rest.<P>If you have any problems, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</A><BR><A NAME="SelfExtract"></A><HR><H2>PC Self Extracting Archives</H2>Some of the files in Road Maps are available as self extracting archivesfor the PC. These archives end with the extension ".exe". The convenienceof this is that with the download of a single file, the user can receivean entire chapter of Road Maps papers, models, or other files. To extractthe contents of the file, simply run it under DOS or double click on itto run it under windows.<P>If you have any problems, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</A><BR><A NAME="pdfsaving"></A><HR><H2>Saving PDF Files Using Netscape</H2>If you are using the Netscape browser which includes the Acrobat viewer,you should be aware of a potential problem with saving Acrobat files. Tosave an Acrobat file that you have been viewing under Netscape, choose"Save As" from the file menu. The dialog box which appears will give twooptions for formats to save the document in. These are "Text," and "Source."Always choose "Source" for Acrobat (pdf) files. The "Text" option willleave the file in a format which the Acrobat reader will not properly recognize.<P>If you have any problems, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</A><BR><HR><CENTER></CENTER><CENTER><A HREF="home.html">MIT SDEP Home</A> | Help | <A HREF="feedback.html">Comments</A>|<A HREF="index.html"> Index</A></CENTER><HR><ADDRESS>Page address: http://sysdyn.mit.edu/help.html</ADDRESS><BR>Created: Mar 3, 1996<BR>Updated: Jan 12, 2000<BR>Page maintained by <A HREF="feedback.html">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</A><BR>Comments and questions are always welcome.</BODY></HTML>
