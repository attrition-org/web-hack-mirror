While we are making these links available, we are not responsiblefor the maintenance and content of these pages. There is a range of qualityof models and information throughout these pages, and we are not endorsingany one over another.<p>The links below primarily deal with system dynamics, STELLA modeling,and education. If you'd like to suggest links that may be of interest inthese fields, please let us know at <a href="feedback.html">webmasters@sysdyn.mit.edu</a>.Now, here are some links to the rest of the system dynamics/systems thinkingworld:<ul><li>The <a href="http://www.albany.edu/cpr/sds/">System Dynamics Society</a>maintains their own webpage containing information about society membership,publications, and an email discussion group.</li><li><a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/">Serendip</a>, where threads onsystems thinking and system dynamics can be found.</li><li>The <a href="http://mvhs1.mbhs.edu/mvhs.html">Maryland Virtual High Schoolof Science and Mathematics</a> has links to many student projects, includingmodels built with STELLA.</li><li>The <a href="http://www.teleport.com/~sguthrie/cc-stadus.html">CC-STADUSProject WWW Page</a>. (Cross-Curricular Systems Thinking and Dynamics UsingSTELLA)</li><li>G&uuml;nther Ossimitz has written a <a href="http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/users/gossimit/links/bookmksd.htm">"megalist of links"</a> to resources for system dynamics and systems thinkingin both German and English. He also has links for software, projects, andconsulting firms.</li><li><a href="http://www.trinityvt.edu/waters/">Waters Center for System Dynamicsat Trinity College of Vermont</a></li><li><a href="http://wwwsoc.nacsis.ac.jp/jsd/index.html">Japanese Chapter of System Dynamics Society (JSD)</a></li><li><a href="http://learning.mit.edu/pra/tool/beer.html">The Beer DistributionGame</a> web site (maintained by the Center for Organizational Learning)contains instructions for playing the beer game. The beer game is an interactivesimulation of a distribution system which shows how business cycles canoccur. It is widely used in business schools and corporations to help managerscope with the complexity of dynamic environments and introduce them tothe concepts of system dynamics.</li><li><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~tomfid">Tom Fiddaman</a> of Ventana Systems has compiled a comprehensive site for system dynamics and system dynamics modeling. Resources consist of papers to download, links to software companies, other general links of interest, and Tom's Model Library. You can even download his MIT dissertation.</li>
