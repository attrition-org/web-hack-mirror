<p>The System Dynamics Group was founded in the early 1960s by Professor
Jay W. Forrester at MIT. At that time, he began applying what he had learned
about systems during his work in electrical engineering to every day kinds
of systems. What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches
to studying complex systems is the use of feedback loops. Stocks and flows
help describe how a system is connected by feedback loops which create
the nonlinearity found so frequently in modern day problems. Computers
software is used to simulate a system dynamics model of the situation being
studied. Running "what if" simulations to test certain policies on such
a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time.
<h2>
The System Dynamics Group Research Projects</h2>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/sdg/">Professor John D. Sterman</a> is the director of the System Dynamics Group.
The Group has three main areas of research at this time.
<p><b>The National Model Project</b> strives for a better understanding
of how the U.S. economy works. The Group uses the System Dynamics National
Model which generates behavior as observed in an actual economy for the
interactions of local structures and decision-making policies, building
a bridge that joins microstructure with macrobehavior. Corporations and
private individuals fund this research.
<p><b><a href="../sdep.html">The System Dynamics in Education Project</a></b>
was established in 1990. Writing the <a href="../road-maps/home.html"><i>Road
Maps</i> </a>series is the main area of activity. <i>Road Maps</i> is a
"do it yourself" workbook for learning system dynamics which is now available
online. Many books and thousands of papers cover the field of system dynamics.
With all of these resources available, it is difficult to know where to
begin learning about system dynamics. Besides selected system dynamics
papers, <i>Road Maps</i> uses modeling exercises (for STELLA II) to provide
a way of learning about the principles of system dynamics.

System Dynamics Group Publications List</a></h2>
This 32 page document includes working papers, dissertations and management
flight simulators that are available for purchase through the mail. It
is in pdf which is readable with the Adobe Acrobat Reader. If you need
instructions on how to set it up, you can visit the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe
site</a> or read our <a href="../help.html">help page</a>.
<h2>
Sponsorship</h2>
Primary funding for all the research of the System Dynamics Group comes
from about fifteen corporations and private individuals who have made a
commitment of both time and money to support the research. A sponsors'
contribution can be either a tax deductible contribution or a business
expense. Contributions can be in "soft-dollars" through arrangements with
several brokerage firms. The annual amount depends on the financial scale
of the sponsor.
<h2>
Graduate Program</h2>
For information about the graduate program in system dynamics, contact
<a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu">The
Sloan School of Management.</a>
<h2>
Executive Education Summer Session</h2>
The System Dynamics Group teaches a one week course in June of each year.
While the main focus is using system dynamics in business applications,
a variety of examples are used during this "crash course in system dynamics."
