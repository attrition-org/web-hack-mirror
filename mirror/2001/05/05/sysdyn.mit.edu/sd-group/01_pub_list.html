By the beginning of 1986, People Express had grown to be the fifth largest airline in the United States, and had revenues of about $1 <I>Billion</I> per year. Its innovative management style and structure were praised as the wave of the future, and companies around the world rushed to imitate them. Yet by September of 1986, People Express was nearly bankrupt, and was acquired at the last minute by Texas Air.</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;What went wrong? </P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The <I>People Express</I> Management Flight Simulator gives you the opportunity to find out by 'flying' the company yourself. The simulator functions just as an aircraft simulator does. You will take command of the firm and pilot it from startup to success. Each simulated time period you will make strategic and operational decisions, and receive feedback from your past decisions. You decide how fast to grow, how to set prices, how aggressively to advertise. Your hiring policies will influence morale, productivity, and turnover; your marketing efforts will shape the growth of demand; your competitors will fight back. You may face financial crisis or unexpected opportunity. You may go bankrupt, or grow to dominate the industry. But there is no winning or losing. The purpose of the simulator is to to give you insight into the issues raised by the case; to illustrate the difficulties of coordinating operations and strategy in a growth market; and to understand the dynamic interconnections among a firm, its market, and its competitors. The flight simulator is a laboratory in which you can systematically explore the consequences of different strategies without risking the fortunes of the real enterprise. </P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The simulator is used successfully for management education and training at the Sloan School of Management at MIT and many other universities and companies. It is extremely easy to use, requiring little or no training.

Sales of new products often grow explosively as word of mouth, advertising, and falling prices attract new buyers. New producers tend to enter the market. But eventually the market saturates and sales fall, often just as capacity is growing the most rapidly. The all-too-frequent result is excess capacity, a price war, huge losses, and the failure of leading firms. The boom and bust dynamic appears in diverse industries, including personal computers, consumer electronics, toys and games, recreational equipment, and semiconductors, to name a few. </P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does boom and bust arise? And why is it so persistent? What prevents companies from learning from the mistakes of others and smoothing out the roller-coaster of new product life cycles? The B &amp; B Enterprises Management Flight Simulator creates a learning laboratory to explore these issues.</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Players take the role of top management of B &amp; B Enterprises, a fictitious firm based on a variety of real cases. The game begins as a new product is launched. Players are responsible for marketing, pricing, and capacity expansion decisions to maximize their cumulative profit over the next 40 quarters. The potential market is large, but as in real life key attributes of the market, including its size and price elasticity, consumer responsiveness to word of mouth, repurchase behavior, and other customer attributes, are unknown. The player also faces a simulated competitor whose pricing, marketing, and capacity expansion strategies are likewise unknown. The game illustrates fundamental principles of corporate strategy including the learning curve, time delays in capacity expansion, competitive dynamics, and market saturation.</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The game can be used alone or in conjunction with a wide range of cases. The strategic environment captured in the game is particularly applicable to consumer durables, toys and games, fashions, fads, and other products that experience rapid growth and saturation. Consumer electronics such as video games, personal computers, CB radios, and VCR&#146;s; durables such as 10 speed bicycles and chain saws; toys and games such as LazerTag and Trivial Pursuit; and even fad products such as wine coolers or fashion watches all exemplify the dynamics captured in the game. B &amp; B focuses on the effective management of the life cycle of a new product, and allows the player to experience issues such as competitive strategy, coordination of pricing, marketing, and capacity acquisition. The game is currently in use at MIT's Sloan School and in a number of other universities and companies around the world. As product life cycles continue to shorten the dynamics exemplified in the game become more and more relevant. &#9;</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B &amp; B Enterprises runs on the Macintosh family of computers, from the Mac Classic up, including Powerbooks and Power Macs.

The accelerating rate of technological, organizational, and social change means managers are faced with situations that are in many ways new, and must increasingly deal with the unexpected. Managers are not alone in facing such daunting tasks. Modern society is built upon systems of enormous complexity, from nuclear power plants to jumbo jets. A pilot, for example, must also control a system of great complexity and be prepared for the unexpected. There is, however, one significant difference between the pilot of a jet and the manager of a business. No airline would dream of sending a pilot up in the real thing before they had had extensive training in a flight simulator on the ground. The simulator allows the pilot to learn, to make mistakes, to experience the unexpected without risk to passengers or aircraft. Yet managers are expected to fly their organizations into unknown skies with their only training being management 'ground school' or experience as junior crew members. </P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This management flight simulator is based on the manual version of <I>The Beer Distribution Game. </I>In the manual game, teams of participants manage each level of the distribution chain. Their are four levels in the system - Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory. Each week, the players at each level receive shipments of beer from their suppliers, fill as much of their customers&#146; orders as possible from their inventory, and place new orders for beer with their supplier. Their goal is to keep company costs as low as possible while meeting customer demand. </P><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Beer Distribution Game</I> Management Flight Simulator gives you the opportunity to 'fly' a company yourself. The simulator functions just as an aircraft simulator does. You will take command of a firm and pilot it from start up to success.

But there is no winning or losing. The purpose of the simulator is to give you insight into the behavior of a distribution system and to illustrate the difficulties of developing a robust strategy for managing even a very simple system. More fundamentally, the flight simulator is a laboratory in which you can systematically explore the consequences of various strategies without risking the fortunes of the real enterprise. </P><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Beer Distribution Game</I> is not about and does not promote beer or drinking.

The accelerating rate of technological, organizational, and social change means managers are faced with situations that are in many ways new, and must increasingly deal with the unexpected. Managers are not alone in facing such daunting tasks. Modern society is built upon systems of enormous complexity, from nuclear power plants to jumbo jets. A pilot, for example, must also control a system of great complexity and be prepared for the unexpected. There is, however, one significant difference between the pilot of a jet and the manager of a business. No airline would dream of sending a pilot up in the real thing before they had had extensive training in the flight simulator on the ground. The simulator allows the pilot to learn, to make mistakes, to experience the unexpected without risk to passengers or aircraft. Yet managers are expected to fly their organizations into unknown skies with their only training being management 'ground school' or experience as junior crew members.</P><P>&#9;<B>The Real Estate Management Flight Simulator</B> gives you the opportunity to 'fly' a company yourself. The simulator functions just as an aircraft simulator does. You will take command of a firm in the volatile market for office buildings industry and pilot it from startup to success. You will decide how many existing buildings to buy or sell and how many new permits to request from City Hall. You may face financial crises or unexpected opportunities. You may go bankrupt, or grow to dominate the industry. But there is no winning or losing. The purpose of the simulator is to give you insight into the issues raised by the particular case; to illustrate the difficulties of investing in a volatile market; and to understand the dynamic interconnections among your firm, its market, and its competitors. More fundamentally, the flight simulator is a laboratory in which you can systematically explore the consequences of various strategies without risking the fortunes of the real enterprise. </P><P>&#9;Most of all, enjoy yourself. Experiment. The first time or two you will want to try to succeed using the strategies you think best. In later trials you may wish to vary systematically aspects of your strategy to identify high-leverage policies. Don't worry if you bankrupt the company. The beauty of a simulator is that you can 'crash' as many times as you wish and walk away every time. Indeed, most of the time real pilots spend in simulators is spent in extreme conditions. You can learn more from piloting the aircraft through rough weather, poor visibility, and with unexpected mechanical failures than in clear skies. Most of your learning will come from understanding what goes wrong. Have fun; you are cleared for takeoff.</P><B><FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Commercial Real Estate </P><P ALIGN="CENTER">Management Flight Simulator</P></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">ORDER FORM</P></B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Commercial Real Estate Management Flight Simulator is a product life cycle simulation including the launch, growth, maturity and decline of the product.
