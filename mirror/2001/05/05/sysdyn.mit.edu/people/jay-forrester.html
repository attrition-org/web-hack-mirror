He pursues three maininterests based on system dynamics: the System Dynamics National Model,which generates the major observed modes of economic behavior; a new managementeducation based on the inherent, dynamic complexity of all the relatedparts of a corporation and brings them into a unified system; and systemdynamics as a methodology for giving cohesion, meaning, and motivationto pre-college education.<P>Jay W. Forrester is Germeshausen Professor Emeritus and Senior Lecturerat the Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He began his career as an electrical engineer working on servomechanismsand large-scale digital computers. While Director of the MIT Digital ComputerLaboratory from 1946 to 1951, he was responsible for the design and constructionof Whirlwind I, one of the first high-speed digital computers.<P>In 1956, Professor Forrester started the <A HREF="/sd-group/home.html">SystemDynamics Group</A> at the Sloan School and with it, the field of systemdynamics. The five books he has written on system dynamics are availablethrough <A HREF="http://www.pegasuscom.com/">Pegasus Communications</A> in Waltham, Massachusetts.<P>Along with many writing and speaking commitments, Professor Forresteris currently working on the National Model Project, a large computer modelof the U.S. economy. He is also the director of the <A HREF="../sdep.html">SystemDynamics in Education Project (SDEP)</A>, which is developing ways to usesystem dynamics and computer modeling as a foundation for a new kind ofkindergarten through 12th grade education. The SDEP project at MIT is writing<a href="road-maps/home.html">Road Maps</A> whichis a guide to learning system dynamics.<BR><HR><H3>Papers by Prof. Jay Forrester available online:</H3><OL><LI><A HREF="ftp://sysdyn.mit.edu/ftp/sdep/papers/D-4224-4.pdf">System Dynamicsand the Lessons of 35 Years (D-4224-4)</A> [332K]</LI><LI><A HREF="ftp://sysdyn.mit.edu/ftp/sdep/papers/D-4165-1.pdf">The Beginningof System Dynamics (D-4165-1)</A> [288K], provides a personal point of viewabout the development of system dynamics.</LI><LI><A HREF="ftp://sysdyn.mit.edu/ftp/sdep/papers/D-4434-1.pdf">Learning throughSystem Dynamics as Preparation for the 21st Century (D-4434-1)</A> [284K],explains the advantages of a system dynamics education for the future.</LI><LI><A HREF="ftp://sysdyn.mit.edu/ftp/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4337.pdf">SystemDynamics and Learner-Centered-Learning in Kindergarten through 12th GradeEducation (D-4337)</A> [218K], presents views on how system dynamics mayimprove classroom learning.</LI><LI><A HREF="ftp://sysdyn.mit.edu/ftp/sdep/papers/D-4665.pdf">System Dynamicsand K-12 Teachers (D-4665)</A> [218K], is Prof. Jay Forrester's most recentwriting on using system dynamics in kindergarten through twelfth gradeeducation.</LI><LI><A HREF="ftp://sysdyn.mit.edu/ftp/sdep/papers/D-4808.pdf">Diseöando El Futuro (D-4808)</A> [32K],is a Spanish translation of the paper Prof. Jay Forrester presented at the University of Sevilleon December 15th, 1998.
