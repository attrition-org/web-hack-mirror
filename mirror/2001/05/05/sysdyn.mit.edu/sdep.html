The Project was founded in 1990, and its primary focus is the use of system dynamics and learner-centered learning in education.  SDEP is a group of students working under the supervision of Prof. Jay W. Forrester, founder of system dynamics.</P><P>The group is writing <CITE><A HREF="road-maps/home.html">Road Maps</A></CITE> which is a guide to learning system dynamics.  Road Maps is a series of self-study guides that use various modeling exercises and selected literature to provide a simple and easily understandable way for learning the methods and principles of system dynamics.</P><P>Nan Lux, the Project advisor, runs the <A HREF="k-12sd-email-list/home.html">K-12 system dynamics email list</A> that serves as an email discussion group where people can share their insights on using system dynamics and system thinking in K-12 education.</P><P>The material prepared by SDEP can be obtained through the <A HREF="http://www.clexchange.org/">Creative Learning Exchange</A>.</P><BR><HR><H2>Staff</H2><H3>Project Director</H3><UL><LI><A HREF="people/jay-forrester.html">Jay W.
