<P><a href="sd-intro/home.html">System dynamics</A>
is a method for studying the world around us. It deals with understanding
how complex systems change over time. Internal feedback loops within the
structure of the system influence the entire system behavior.

<P>Education is an important area of application for system dynamics. Together
with learner-centered learning, it forces the learner to become actively
involved. The wide range of applications for system dynamics makes it an
excellent tool for integrating the material of many subjects.

<P>The <a href="sdep.html">System Dynamics in Education
Project (SDEP)</A> is a group of students and staff in the <A HREF="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/">Sloan
School of Management</A> at the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts
Institute of Technology</A>, working under the guidance of <a href="people/jay-forrester.html">Professor Jay
W. Forrester</a>, the founder of system dynamics.

The primary project of the group is writing the Road Maps series. Road
Maps is a series of self-study guides that use modeling exercises and selected
literature to provide a resource for learning about the principles and
practices of system dynamics. Road Maps is an ongoing project but the first
nine chapters are complete and available at this time.

Website</A>
<BR>Check back often for the latest updates on additions and changes to
the SDEP website.

<P><a href="k-12sd-email-list/home.html">K-12 Email
Discussion Group</A>
<BR>We are maintaining a K-12 system dynamics email list that discusses
the use of system dynamics and systems thinking in K-12 education.

<P><a href="http://www.clexchange.org">Creative Learning Exchange</A>
<BR>The Creative Learning Exchange was founded to serve as a networking
hub for K-12 educators interested in using system dynamics in schools.

<p><a href="gsp98/home.html">Guided Study Program</a>
<br>Our Guided Study Program is over for the time being and we do not expect the course to be offered again in the near future.  We send our sincere appreciation to those participants in the Program for the past three years.  However, you may see and use the assignments and solutions to the 1998-1999 course in the <a href="gsp98/home.html">Archives</a>.  You may also wish to consider a separate distance learning course in system dynamics taught here at MIT by Professor Jim Hines.  For more information on Hine's course, click <a href="http://caes.mit.edu/asp/off_campus/system_dynamics/index.html">here</a>.


<P><a href="sd-group/">System Dynamics Group</A>
<BR>The System Dynamics Group at MIT is working on several research projects
about system dynamics.


<P><a href="sds.html">System Dynamics Society</A>
<BR>The System Dynamics Society encourages the development and use of system dynamics around the world.

<P><a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</A>
<BR>A Frequently Asked Questions list containing answers for a number of requests on our website or files originating from it.
<P><a href="papers-index.html">Index of Papers Online</A>
<BR>An annotated index of papers about system dynamics that are available
for downloading from this website.
<P><a href="other-links.html">Links to the Rest of
the World...</A>
<BR>There are many other links which you can explore to learn more about
computer modeling and simulation.
