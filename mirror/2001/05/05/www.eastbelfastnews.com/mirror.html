<p><left>Ireland's national flag has its origins in the French Revolution and the French flag. The Tricolour was designed to signify the peace (white) between Nationalists (green) and Unionists (orange). It was hoisted above the General Post Office in Dublin during the 1916 Easter Rising, and has since been used by Ireland's Nationalists and Republicans North and South of the border.</left></p>

<h3>THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT

<br>OF THE <br>

IRISH REPUBLIC
 
<br>

TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND</h3></b>

<p><b>IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from 
which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons 
her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.
Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary 
organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military 
organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently 
perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to 
reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and, supported by her exiled children 
in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own 
strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.
We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, 
and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and 
indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and 
government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished 
except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish 
people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times 
during the last three hundred years they have asserted it to arms. Standing on 
that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, 
we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we 
pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of its 
freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.
The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every 
Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, 
equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its 
resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of 
its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of 
the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a 
minority from the majority in the past.
Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a 
permanent National, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by 
the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby 
constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in 
trust for the people.
We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most 
High God. Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who 
serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, in humanity, or rapine. In 
this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline and by the 
readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove 
itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.</b></p>
