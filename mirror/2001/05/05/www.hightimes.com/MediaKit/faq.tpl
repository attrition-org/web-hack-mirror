<FONT FACE="verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif" SIZE="4"><B>GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE</B></FONT><P>

1. <B>What does "420" mean?</B><BR>
Basically it means "time to smoke pot" or "pot smoking," as 4:20 is usually done at 4:20 PM or AM. But there's more to it than that. In fact, there are several different versions of the origin of "420."<P>

"420" was allegedly a police code for "marijuana smoking in progress" in certain California counties. (Another variation of the myth, from the book <I>Storming Heaven-LSD and the American Dream</I> and written by Jay Stevens, says that the first dose of LSD was taken by Albert Hofmann at 4:20 PM.) At any rate, some smokers began to use "420" to refer to their own "marijuana smoking in progress." It wasn't long before 4:20 became "tea-time" for many people who began to enjoy using "let's 420" instead of "let's smoke some pot."<P>

After awhile, April 20 (4/20) began to take on some significance and became known as "The Stoner New Year." Even more bizarre, some people began to develop a "420 fetish." They formed "420 Clubs" instead of Bong Teams, smoking only at 4:20 AM and PM, waiting all day before they lit up a joint (or bong or whatever), and would wake up at 4:20 AM to indulge.<P>

There has even been a 4:20 backlash. People have formed "8:40 Clubs," where they smoke twice as much as people do at 4:20. They have smoked out at 2:10, to get an early jump. They smoke every hour on the hour at twenty minutes past, since it's always 4:20 somewhere. Meanwhile entire industries have grown up around the "420" banner. There is a 420 Records, a "420 Productions," and of course, a <A HREF="http://www.420.com/">www.420.com</A> Web site.<P>

2.  <B>How can I submit articles, stories, ideas, drawings, cartoons, etc.?</B><BR>
Send all submissions to:<BR>
HIGH TIMES magazine<BR>
235 Park Avenue South<BR>
5th Floor<BR>
New York, NY 10003<BR>
Attention: Editorial Submissions<P>

Send a Self-Addressed Envelope (SASE) to obtain a copy of the writer's guidelines for HIGH TIMES magazine.<P>

3. <B>I am looking for some information on urine tests/I need to know about how to pass a urine test/Is there any known reliable way to pass a urinalysis if you only smoke pot/etc.?</B><BR>
Please check the <A HREF="../Reference/Testing/index.tpl">Drug Tests</A> section on the HIGH TIMES home page. This contains some current information on urine tests. If you have any more questions call the HIGH TIMES Hotline (1-900-988-8463), or the NORML 900-Line (1-900-97-NORML).<P>

Due to the many differences in metAboutlism, different types of urine test, blood tests, and hair tests, and legal complications we have decided not to post the information on how to pass a drug test on the Web site for now. Also, we believe the best way to pass a drug test is to REFUSE TO TAKE ONE.<P>

Drug tests are unconstitutional, unreliable, and the worst invasion of personal privacy that anyone could ever think of. The only way to stop drug testing is to sue the companies that try to force you to take one, refuse to buy products from companies that drug test employees (which is difficult, because so many companies drug test employees), and refuse to take them.<P>

Remember, t<B>hese drug tests are NOT 100% reliable</B> so anyone who never took illegal drugs can flunk, and anyone who might have ingested illegal drugs can pass. Worst of all, many companies are not even interested in illegal drug use. They are inspecting people's urine for genetic predisposition toward certain diseases or medical conditions. When you allow a company to drug test you are giving them much more personal information that they should ever know.<P>

We do not wish to encourage people to use masks or tricks to pass drug tests, we want you to help us stop them altogether. For that reason we are reformatting the section to encourage people from not taking these tests. If you are intent on taking a job that requires you to take a pre-employment drug test, then we strongly suggest you stop smoking for a few months, clean out your system, and do your job interviews. If you take a job that requires periodical drug testing, you are really faced with a choice: stop smoking, or risk losing your job.<P> 

4. <B>Can you tell me how to get some seeds/Can you tell me where to get some good buds/Does HIGH TIMES sell marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia through the Internet?</B>
HIGH TIMES provides articles, facts and debates  about recreational and medicinal drugs to adults for informational purposes only. We do not encourage the recreational use of drugs. There are other sites, or perhaps even some advertisers on this site or others on the Internet, that will be only too glad to help you with these questions. For instance, if you go to the Yahoo search engine and type in "cannabis seeds" a number of international seed banks will be listed.<P>

We've received a number of questions concerning the Dutch seed companies--especially the Sensi Seed Bank. They do not mail seeds to the United States--they only do business in Holland, where it is legal to grow cannabis/hemp/marijuana for seed production.<P>

<B>NOTE:</B> Throughout HIGH TIMES' long history, the vast majority of marijuana consumers have refused to join NORML or contribute any money to the cause of marijuana legalization because they are afraid their "name will end up on a list." Yet many of these same people will pay someone they barely know for seeds or pot--and their names end up on a list. This despite the fact that no one has ever been arrested for contributing to activist organizations. (In fact, many people who belong to activist groups enjoy a large support system if they are arrested on marijuana charges).<P>

There have been dozens of sting operations run by DEA agents and undercover narcotics officers where they sell marijuana seeds from small advertisements in newspapers, leaflet campaigns, cultivation stores, and other apparently legitimate operations. Lately, web sites offering Dutch seeds for sale have been showing up, enticing customers to buy pot seeds. 
These operations could very well be DEA fronts, or could end up busted by the Feds and then coerced into entrapping people who do business with them. IT IS ILLEGAL TO BUY SEEDS THROUGH THE MAIL. DON'T DO IT. 
Any legitimate seed company will not sell or mail seeds to America. If they do, they are not to be trusted, and you could end up busted.<P>


5. <B>What is the Cannabis Cup?</B><BR>
The Cannabis Cup was founded by Steven Hager in 1988 in order to establish an international standard for cannabis seeds. He modeled it after the harvest festivals held in California in the 1970s, where growers would bring their finest buds to a public gathering and tasting and a winner would be judged.
Over the years, the Cannabis Cup has grown from a small meeting of a handful of select celebrities and HIGH TIMES editors to a convention of hundreds of people from all over the world. For the last few years it has been held in Amsterdam during the traditional, American, Thanksgiving holiday weekend. 
As a result, many public weed contests bill themselves as "The Cannabis Cup," but accept no substitutions. If it's not the Official HIGH TIMES Cannabis Cup, it's not the real thing.<P>

6. <B>What is skunk?</B><BR>
Skunk was originally Skunk #1, the first winner of the HIGH TIMES Cannabis Cup in 1988 and one of the first superstar varieties of indoor marijuana. Soon street dealers were calling their product "skunk," and the term soon became a code word for high-quality buds.<P>

7. <B>What is sinsemilla?</B><BR>
Sinsemilla is marijuana that grown under conditions where the female plants have been separated from the males. This causes the female plants to ooze more resin in search of male pollination so that the plant can produce seeds.<P> 

Many connoisseurs prefer the seedless sinsemilla to seedy buds, but there are those purists who feel that sex-starved female plants cause an unnatural stress in the plant, and prefer the lower-grade, but more natural, sexed marijuana.<P> 

8. <B>How do I tell a male from a female plant?</B><BR>
Visit the <A HREF="../Reference/Cultivation/index.tpl">Cultivation</A> section. Kyle Kushman and Max Yields have answered this question many times.<P> 

9. <B>What about narcs/How can you tell if someone is a narc/What are the laws of entrapment?</B><BR>
There is no surefire way to tell if someone is a narc or not. Narcs are professional liars and are out to bust any drug user (often high profile/celebrity drug users), any way they can, and will use the most devious methods imaginable to do so. Most often people are not set up by a narcotics officer, they are turned in by a paid informant who is trying to avoid their own jail sentence for drug trafficking or who is getting paid a lot of money for turning in small-time drug users and dealers.<P>

It is not beyond imagination that an informer could weasel their way into an activist group, or would hang out at an activist event in order to entrap people. Beware any strangers, and do not do business with anyone you don't already know.<P>

Most often, growers or dealers are not entrapped by a narc--they are informed on by a suspicious neighbor, jealous spouse, angry "friend," or misguided acquaintance. This is the most difficult and stressful part of getting involved in any illegal activity--keeping a lid of secrecy about all aspects of the operation.<P>

If you are serious about changing the laws against marijuana, we suggest staying drug-free. If this lifestyle decision is against your principles, study these laws very carefully, take no chances for which you are not prepared to suffer consequences for, and be as discreet as possible.<P>

The simplest way to avoid being set up is to avoid doing anything with anyone you don't know.<P>

10. <B>I heard a rumor that HIGH TIMES is owned by the government/operated by the DEA/that the subscription list run by the FBI!</B><BR>
This rumor is often spread by the government and police agencies in an effort to thwart marijuana legalization efforts. For instance, the DEA heavily publicized the fact that a "HIGH TIMES subscriber" is number one on their "pot grower profile" despite the fact that they have no way of knowing if someone subscribes or not. Then again, if someone really stupid is smuggling pot wirth them from their weekend in Negril, Jamaica, they're probably the one wearing the tie-dye pot t-shirt and reading a copy of HIGH TIMES in the Customs line.<P>

Yes, if someone does decide to break the law and grow, sell or smoke marijuana, they would be insane to wear a "HIGH TIMES" t-shirt or other marijuana- or psychedelic- related clothing in public to advertise the fact. That's just common sense.<P>

Here is some more common sense: If HIGH TIMES were strictly set up as a sting operation to get subscriber's names, why don't we offer a "Bill Me Later" option? That way, we could get ten times as many names. And why don't we lower the subscription price? That way we could entrap more people. Finally, why are there 15,000 people who have subscribed to HIGH TIMES for years and years who have never received a visit from the police?<P>

As you can see, the people who believe and spread these rumors fall into two categories: morons and cops.<P>

Also, people who believe those rumors sometime think: "It must be illegal for HIGH TIMES to publish. Therefore they must have a deal with the government to turn over people who subscribe to stay in business."<P>

Yes, HIGH TIMES is illegal--in countries that do not have strong Constitutional rights like the United States of America. But in this country, HIGH TIMES is protected by the highest law in the land--The First Amendment of the Bill of Rights in our Constitution which declares: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<P>

Oddly enough, even after the U.S. government has investigated HIGH TIMES, harassed the magazine, and tried to pass legislation specifically designed to put us out of business, there are still people who still listen to and believe rumors that we cooperate with those bastards. And often, these rumors get pumped up whenever HIGH TIMES or the marijuana movement has enjoyed some success. Needless to say, the rumor-mongers are the same people who are NOT card-carrying members of NORML, support marijuana activist groups, or otherwise work to change the laws. Sometimes, they are even paid informants who are setting up marijuana busts.<P>

Even NORML and other legalization groups have to live with these idiotic rumors. If you want to stop the government from keep marijuana/cannabis/hemp illegal, stop spreading stupid, false rumors against HIGH TIMES and NORML. There enough rumors that are true.<P>

11. <B>HIGH TIMES has published recipes for "crank." Could you send me a copy?</B><BR>
Don't be ridiculous. HIGH TIMES magazine has never published instructions for speed, methedrine or crank. And we certainly wouldn't recommend that anyone use garbage drugs like that, much less manufacture some for distribution.<P>

12. <B>What about legal herbs/legal highs/legal ecstasy?</B><BR>
There are many herbal mixtures and preparations on the market that claim to produce certain effects. Some people enjoy them, some people don't, others get no effect at all from these things. It's impossible for HIGH TIMES to guess what kind of effect they'll have on you.<P>

Should you decide to experiment with any substances, natural or chemical, we suggest that you do so under a physician's care, or at the very least, check the dosage level very carefully and do not exceed it. Mixing alcohol or other drugs with any over the counter drugs or herbal preparations can also be very dangerous.<P>

One rule of thumb we tell advertisers and readers is that the longer an advertisement runs, the more likely that an advertiser is selling merchandise or services that are worth investing in. HIGH TIMES' longest-running advertisers--some of whom have been advertising with us for 20 years or more--are clearly the mark of a company with a large and devoted customer base.<P>

13. <B>What about the legal marijuana or herbal smoking blends that the companies sell? Is it any good?</B><BR>
Again, it's up to individual taste. The only way to find out for yourself is to try it.<P>

14. <B>Where can I buy cultivation supplies?</B><BR>
Grow lights, potting soil, fertilizers and other common indoor growing supplies are available at many department stores, nurseries, hardware stores, and other outlets. There are also many shops that specialize in this kind of equipment. Occasionally, there are advertiser links to companies that sell this equipment online. Visit the <A HREF="../Advertise/index.tpl">Site Sponsors</A> page to see all of this month's advertisers.<P>

Remember that whenever you order grow supplies from any store, Web site, or service. that you should NEVER mention or refer to cannabis, marijuana seeds, or any kind of illegal activity. I<P>

15. <B>I/my friend/my relative just got busted. Where can I get legal help?</B><BR>
NORML (norml.org) features a national legal referral service. If they can't help you, call the local BAR association. Don't pick the first guy that comes around--set up an appointment, meet with them, and make sure you feel comfortable that they can handle your defense.<P>

16. <B>I heard HIGH TIMES said the best pot is grown in my state/I heard my college is the Number One Party College according to HIGH TIMES magazine/etc.</B><BR>
HIGH TIMES magazine has never declared that any one state has the best pot in the country. And HIGH TIMES has never run a poll of the country's best party towns or colleges.<P>

Occasionally a statement like this will be made in the Pot 40, but we don't have a master database to be able to look up every vote ever published (yet).<P>

17. <B>How can I get involved in the movement to legalize marijuana?</B>
First, join NORML. Although this is not the most effective thing that can be done, increasing their membership is the most important thing that needs to be done.<P>

Second, become informed. Read as much as you can about the current laws, about any medical risks and benefits of cannabis, about the history of drug prohibition, about the politicians who are passing our laws and about how these laws can be changed.<P>

Write to your local, state and federal representatives and express your point of view. Encourage them to end the Drug War.<P>

Write letters to newspapers and magazines expressing your point of view.<P>

18. <B>I am working on a report about marijuana prohibition/legalization. Can you help me?</B><BR>
For information about marijuana (aka hemp) history, visit the Hemp History section. For information about medical marijuana or recent legislative efforts visit the recent <A HREF="/News/index.tpl">News</A> or the <A HREF="/Reference/Medicine/index.tpl">Medical</A> section.<P>

We also encourage you to visit the <A HREF="../Reference/links/index.tpl">Links</A> section, where there's even more material.<P>

19. <B>How does marijuana affect pregnancy?</B><BR>
There have been no definitive studies on the medical use of marijuana because it has been kept illegal for so long, but<P>

To learn more about the medical uses or the true facts about cannabis (aka marijuana), please visit our <A HREF="../Reference/links/index.tpl">Links</A> section (especially <A HREF="/Reference/Relegalize/index.tpl">Relegalize It</A>!).<P>

20. <B>I am visiting the Caribbean/Amsterdam/Wherever soon and want to know where I can buy marijuana while I am there. How can I smuggle some back with me? And I can't find any connections where I live. Can you help me?</B><BR>
First, do not carry anything with you when you travel to any foreign country. Their jails are often harsh places to live. Second, HIGH TIMES does not publish, or even know of, places where people can buys drugs. Third, even if we did know, the police would find out and bust anyone who went there.<P>

Also, it's never wise to try to smuggle anything from a foreign country home with you. The risks (going to jail for life) outweigh the benefits (saving a few dollars). Also, drug smugglers are experts in their field. Amateurs should not try this at home.<P>

Finally, HIGH TIMES is not about to give people information about how/where to buy illegal drugs. Besides, if you don't know how to make friends who share common interests with you by now, it's too late for us to help you.
