The New York Melendez had never been south of New Jersey, and was arrested after police intervened in a marital dispute--even though his wife said she didn't want to press charges. Told he had to wait behind bars until his identity could be confirmed, he was released at 5 AM on a frigid February morning, now jobless and without even a quarter to call for a ride home. He is suing for $1 million in damages. [Long Island] <i>Newsday</i>, April 11, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Urine Dealer Claims Free Speech</I></B><BR>GREENVILLE COUNTY, SC--A South Carolina man arrested after selling his urine over the Internet disputes allegations he sold it to help people cheat on drug tests. "I'm not a drug dealer. I'm a urine dealer," said Kenneth Curtis of Greenville County. Curtis, owner of Privacy Protection Services, was arrested at a Marietta gas station after he allegedly delivered a urine kit to an undercover state Law Enforcement Division agent, who bought it online. The state Supreme Court heard arguments in October about whether it was legal for Curtis to sell urine online, but has yet to rule on the case. In 1999 the state legislature banned the sale of urine for the purpose of cheating a drug test, following Texas, Nebraska and Pennsylvania, which have passed similar laws. Curtis, who has sold his urine over the Internet for three years, has sued, claiming the new statute infringes on his constitutional rights. He said the real issue is privacy, and that bodily fluids collected from drug tests can offer information on health risks and pregnancy. <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, April 13, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Riots and Curfew in Cincinnati</I></B><BR>CINCINNATI, OH--Mayor Charles Luken declared a state of emergency and an 8 AM-6 PM curfew in Cincinnati, saying parts of his city resembled war-torn Beirut after violent protests over the shooting death of an unarmed black man by police. "It is dangerous and getting more dangerous," he said. He also said the National Guard may be brought in. Luken said his first priority was to restore order, then look into complaints of police brutality--but his own press conference was interrupted by protesters. The fatal shooting April 7 of Timothy Thomas, 19, by a white officer sparked days of unrest, a federal investigation and calls for accountability. Thomas was killed as he fled Officer Steven Roach, who was trying to arrest him for failing to appear for misdemeanor charges and traffic violations. Roach's union said he feared for his life during the encounter. Since 1995, 15 black men died at the hands of Cincinnati police, including four since November. In the days of violent protests following Thomas' death, storefronts were sacked and one police officer was reported shot--although his gun-belt buckle caught the bullet and saved him. At least 66 have been arrested in the unrest. AP, Reuters, April 12, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>NJ Racial Profiling Scandal Still Simmers</I></B><BR>TRENTON, NJ--Accused of misleading the New Jersey legislature about the extent of racial profiling carried out by police during his term as state attorney general, state Supreme Court Justice Peter Verniero is facing calls for his resignation. Among those joining the chorus demanding that he step down is acting Governor Donald DiFrancesco, who has threatened a censure resolution and possibly an impeachment hearing if Verniero does not resign. Verniero is alleged to have deliberately withheld information during his 1999 testimony on racial profiling. Lindesmith Center newsletter: April 9, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Five Years for Activist in Republican Convention Bust?</I></B><BR>PHILADELPHIA--A Philadelphia jury found activist Kate Sorensen guilty in the first felony trial to emerge from last August's Republican Convention. Although the jury found Sorensen guilty of only a misdemeanor--"criminal mischief," i.e., talking on a cell phone during the protests--prosecutors pledge to seek a five-year prison term. Direct Action Network press release, March 23, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Sentencing Commission Weighs Ecstasy</I></B><BR>WASHINGTON--Fourteen leading neuroscientists and drug policy experts are calling on the US Sentencing Commission to reject a proposal to treat MDMA (Ecstasy) more severely than heroin. The group said that there was "no justification, either pharmacologically or in policy terms" for the proposed increased penalties. Currently, one gram of MDMA is deemed equivalent to 35 grams of marijuana. The commission has proposed an equivalency of 1,000 grams, the same as heroin. As the weight of a typical MDMA tablet is about 10 times the weight of a typical dose of heroin, that means that each dose of MDMA would have the same sentencing value as 10 doses of heroin--or 800 marijuana cigarettes. The Federation of American Scientists statement calls that "grossly disproportionate" to the harms involved. <i>US Newswire</i>, March 18, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Oregon Forfeiture Reform Upheld</I></B><BR>MARION COUNTY, OR--An Oregon judge turned aside a legal challenge to the civil-asset-forfeiture reform measure approved by Oregon voters last year. Measure 3 restricts the ability of law-enforcement agencies to seize property from people not found guilty of committing any crime. Shortly after voters approved the measure, Lincoln County and its interagency narcotics team brought a legal challenge against it. The challenge sought to overturn the measure on technical grounds but, Marion County Circuit Court Judge Pamela Abernethy upheld it. Lincoln Country law-enforcement agencies are expected to appeal the decision. Lindesmith Center newsletter, April 13, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Feds Seek Chemical "Cure" For Pot High</I></B><BR>WASHINGTON--Using human subjects, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has identified a compound called SR141716 that blocks cannabinoid receptors in the brain and inhibits the marijuana high. NIDA chief Alan Leshner advocates use of SR141716, despite the fact that its use would restrict naturally occurring chemical processes in the brain. NIDA hopes the compound can be a "treatment" for marijuana use. For obvious reasons, there will be little demand for SR141716 among marijuana-smokers, leading critics to charge that NIDA is promoting coerced treatment. Lindesmith Center newsletter, April 13, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Texas School Ends Battle Over Drug-Test Program</I></B><BR>LOCKNEY, TX--The Lockney Independent School District is dropping its appeal of a federal judge's decision that its mandatory drug-testing program was unconstitutional. The policy required all students in the 6th through 12th grades to submit to a urine test. "We're happy it's over with," said Larry Tannahill, who filed the lawsuit along with the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of his 13-year-old son, Brady. Brady was the only student to refuse testing when the school began its program in February 2000.<BR><BR>Tannahill agreed not to pursue further legal action. He also said the district agreed to discontinue most drug-testing. "My understanding is they would go back to the old policy, which was suspicion," Tannahill said. Under the old policy, students can be tested if they show erratic behavior consistent with drug or alcohol impairment. In a March 1 ruling, US District Judge Sam Cummings said the mandatory drug-testing policy came at "a great price to citizens' constitutionally guaranteed rights to be secure in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects.'" --<i>Lubbock Avalanche-Journal</i>, Apr. 26, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Oops, Wrong Guy</I></B><BR>ALBANY, NY--The state of New York will pay $3.25 million to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of Kerry Sanders, a mentally disturbed homeless man whose arrest in Los Angeles and bungled identification by authorities led to two years of mistaken imprisonment. Authorities decided Kerry was actually Robert Sanders, a drug dealer wanted in New York, and extradited him--dismissing his protests that his name was not Robert as signs of mental illness! Kerry's mother launched a futile search for her son after he disappeared from the L.A. streets in 1993. Kerry was released in 1995 after the real fugitive was arrested in Cleveland. <i>New York Times</i>, April 13, 2001<BR><BR><BR><B>MEDICAL MARIJUANA</B><BR><BR><BR><B><I>Medical-Marijuana Provider Arrested</I></B><BR>LAKE TAHOE, CA--On April 11, 28-year-old outspoken medical-marijuana activist and provider Matthew Macosko was arrested in connection with a package of medical cannabis he had sent to one of his clients who was out of state. The package, mailed earlier from California to Kentucky--where Macosko's client was on tour as a chef for a rock band--was not picked up there and was being returned to California when a US postal inspector alerted local authorities that it smelled like cannabis. Armed with that tip, a South Lake El Dorado Narcotics Enforcement (SLEDNET) team staked out the post office and picked up Macosko shortly after he picked up the package. He was charged with transportation of marijuana and possession of marijuana for sale; if convicted on both counts, he faces seven years.<BR><BR>Reached at home shortly after he was released on his own recognizance, Macosko, who has a doctor's recommendation to use medical cannabis and who has appeared on the cover of the Tahoe Daily Tribune in a photo showing him delivering cannabis to a man who suffers from emphysema, said it was his intention to open a medical-marijuana dispensary called the Tahoe Healing Caregivers. "I have strong beliefs about society and I am ready to take a serious stand against the injustice of people not being able to get their medicine," he told HT. "I feel we are going to set a precedent in this case."<BR><BR>As we go to press, no federal charges have been filed. --<i>Tahoe Daily Tribune</i> and personal correspondence, April 13, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Judge Orders Return of Oregon Med-Mar User's Pot</I></B><BR>DOUGLAS, AZ--A Douglas judge dismissed charges against an Oregon man who had allegedly brought marijuana from Mexico when he showed proof that he was part of Oregon's medical-marijuana program. The judge also ordered sheriff's deputies to return the 41 grams of cannabis they had confiscated from Frederic Henry Starkweather, 56, of Gold Beach, OR, who was arrested by US Customs agents at the Douglas border crossing on March 19. Starkweather admitted the marijuana was his, but claimed he had not bought it in Mexico and showed his Oregon medical-marijuana card to the agent, who turned the case over to the local authorities. Though Judge Michael Herbolich dismissed charges on March 20, sheriff's deputies balked at returning the cannabis, but finally agreed when the DEA and other authorities refused to get involved in disputing the judge's decision.<BR><BR>Judge Herbolich called it "a unique case.... I saw a guy who had a medical problem." --<i>Sierra Vista Herald</i>, April 21, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Legislation in Congress Again</I></B><BR>WASHINGTON--Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) has reintroduced legislation to provide for the medical use of marijuana. The bill, titled the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act, wold allow doctors to prescribe marijuana, creating an exception to the Controlled Substances Act. "People who are suffering from severe or terminal illnesses who find a measure of relief from marijuana ought to be able to use it without being treated like criminals," Frank said. "This bill offers an opportunity for my conservative colleagues to decide if they really want to be consistent on the question of states' rights or if they think the federal government should tell states what to do." Since 1996, nine states--Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington--have implemented laws allowing seriously ill patients to possess and use medical marijuana under a doctor's supervision. But these laws are not recognized by the federal government, and do not shield patients from federal prosecution. NORML press release, April 3, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Berkeley: 2.5 Pounds Is Enough</I></B><BR>BERKELEY, CA--The Berkeley City Council settled the question of how much stash is permissible for medical purposes. By an 8-to-1 vote, the council allowed a "qualified patient" to possess as many as 10 marijuana plants and 2 1/2 pounds of dried marijuana. California's Proposition 215, passed by voters in 1996, allows marijuana cultivation and use by qualified patients for "personal medical purposes" but does not set any limits on how much pot a patient can keep. --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, March 28, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>DEA Denies Rescheduling Petition</I></B><BR>WASHINGTON--The DEA has formally denied a petition to repeal marijuana's Schedule I status and reschedule it under provisions of the Controlled Substance Act. The denial of the petition, filed six years ago old by activist Jon Gettman and HIGH TIMES, was issued only one week before oral arguments in the Supreme Court case, US v. Oakland Buyers' Cooperative, in which the Court will determine the viability of the "medical necessity" defense for marijuana. In denying the petition, the DEA concluded that marijuana has a high potential for abuse like cocaine and heroin, that even small levels of THC in industrial hemp pose a threat to public health, and that marijuana leads to the use of other drugs. The petitioners pledge to challenge the decision before the US Court of Appeals. Press release, March 27, 2001<BR><BR><BR><B>INTERNATIONAL DRUG WAR NEWS</B><BR><BR><BR><B><I>UK House Of Lords Backs Medical Pot</I></B><BR>LONDON--A report released by England's House of Lords recommends that medical-marijuana users not face prosecution. The report, released by the Select Committee on Science and Technology, also calls for speeding up research into developing cannabis-based medicines. States the report: "In the absence of viable alternative medicine, and though we would not encourage smoking of cannabis, we consider it undesirable to prosecute genuine therapeutic users of cannabis who possess or grow cannabis for their own use.This unsatisfactory situation underlines the need to legalize cannabis preparations for therapeutic use." The Lindesmith Center newsletter, March 23, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>UNDCP Under Fire</I></B><BR>THE HAGUE, THE NETHERLANDS--The Netherlands recently withdrew their financial support for the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP). The UNDCP faces allegations of gross mismanagement at the hands of director Pino Arlacchi. Numerous high-level staff have resigned in protest of his policies. Arlacchi has forged an alliance with Afghanistan's Taliban and recently claimed success in eliminating the country's opium crop. He is also accused of setting up paramilitary units on the borders of Tajikistan and Afghanistan to combat the opium trade. --Lindesmith Center newsletter, April 13, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Auditors Clear UN Drug Czar</I></B><BR>VIENNA--A team of British auditors for the United Nations has cleared Pino Arlacchi, the head of the organization's antinarcotics office, of charges of impropriety made by a former associate and some politicians in Europe. But the report faulted his office, the UN Drug Control Program, in Vienna, for some lapses in recruitment procedures and handling of travel expenses, as well as overambitious programs begun before money was available to see them through. Two other reports on his office are due in coming weeks from the UN inspector general's office. --<i>New York Times</i>, Apr. 27, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Hardline France Tries to Weed Out Cannabis Lobby</I></B><BR>PARIS--Two propot activists risk spending a year in jail for wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a picture of a cannabis leaf. A zealous prosecutor this week demanded 12-month prison terms for Jean-Pierre Galland, president of the Cannabis Information and Research Collective, and Laurence Duffy, head of the group's Lyon branch, for contravening Article 630 of the French public-health regulations. The law bans French citizens from "portraying in a favorable light and promoting or inciting the consumption of any product classed as a banned substance." The pair is also accused of selling CDs bearing the deeply suspect title of A Little Piece of Hemp Music. Galland has so far incurred fines totaling over $15,000 for his activities, the most memorable of which was to mail all 577 members of the French parliament a neatly rolled joint along with a letter demanding the relaxation of France's drug laws, among the harshest in Europe. Theoretically, the import of a few grams of Dutch weed is punishable by up to 30 years in prison. --Guardian Unlimited Internet Magazine , Apr. 26, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Authorities Charge Coca Farmers With Shooting</I></B><BR>LA PAZ, BOLIVIA--Bolivian government authorities laid responsibility for shootings that damaged military and police barracks on coca growers in the Chapare region who are angry with the government's coca crop-eradication program. The shootings, which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 18 and 19, caused extensive property damage but no casualties. The leader of the coca growers' association in the region--formerly the center of coca production in Bolivia--denies any involvement with the incident, and claims the government invented the story to justify a massive police and military buildup in the region in recent days. --AP, April 19, 2001 <BR><BR><B><I>Rebel Leader Backs Berenson's Story</I></B><BR>LIMA, PERU--Convicted Tupac Amaru leader Miguel Rincon has testified in the new civilian trial of New Yorker Lori Berenson--facing 20 years for aiding terrorists--that she knew nothing about his rebel group's plot to take over Peru's Congress in 1995, for which she was tried and found guilty of treason. Rincon claimed that he had duped Berenson into renting a house later used by Tupac Amaru rebels and that the key witness against her in her initial trial, Pacifico Castrellon, a known Panamanian gun and drug runner, had fabricated his testimony "to be able to unload his responsibilities onto her."<BR><BR>Prosecutors are claiming that Rincon is covering up for Berenson, though they did not give a reason why he would do that. --AP, April 20, 2001 <BR><BR><B><I>Violence Re-Emerges in Chiapas</I></B><BR>CHIAPAS, MEXICO--The violence between progovernment paramilitaries and peasants loyal to the Zapatista rebels had been at a low ebb in Chiapas since the December government transition, with a peace deal pending between the Zapatistas and President Vicente Fox. On April 20, army troops pulled out of Guadalupe Tepeyac in the Zapatistas' jungle stronghold, one of the last positions to be abandoned under the peace deal. But 100 miles away in the highland village of Venustiano Carranza, eight Maya Indians were killed that same day in a land dispute between a pro-Zapatista peasant organization and the Bartolome Alliance paramilitary. The eight were all Bartolome followers, gunned down while working their fields by masked men with machine guns--probably in retaliation for earlier violence. Venustiano Carranza has been the scene of much bloodshed between paramilitary and Zapatista sympathizers since the 1994 Chiapas revolt. Four days earlier, paramilitaries in Chilon attacked pro-Zapatista peasants. A woman was raped, a youth wounded, three houses burned and 25 displaced. It was the first major paramilitary attack since Fox took power. --<i>Excelsior</i>, April 16; AP, April 20, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Mexican Cartels Form New Alliance at Monterrey Summit</I></B><BR>MONTERREY, MEXICO--On Jan. 26, drug kingpins from throughout Mexico flew into Monterrey in private jets and caravaned in a fleet of brand-new SUVs to the nearby town of Apodaca, where they met in the back room of a restaurant to form a new alliance and end the violent turf wars between regional cartels. According to controversial reports of the three-day cartel summit, the kingpins shared contacts and opened their books to each other. They pledged to combine efforts and create a unified bribe fund for federal officials. They divided Mexico's national territory between them, with major urban centers such as Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara declared "open cities" where all organizations can operate freely. They swore to respect each other's turf and instead turn up the heat on law enforcement. Among those in attendance:<BR><BR>--Juan "El Azul" Esparragosa Moreno, representing the Juarez cartel, which controls Chihuahua state and is Mexico's second-largest crime syndicate.<BR><BR>--Humberto Garcia Abrego, representing the Matamoros-based Gulf cartel, which he assumed control of when his brother Juan was busted in 1996 and extradited to the US, where he is serving an 11-year sentence.<BR><BR>--Ignacio "Nacho" Coronel, representing the regional organization from the small Pacific Coast state of Colima, which had been challenging the Gulf cartel for control of Matamoros.<BR><BR>--Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, representing Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who recently escaped from a top-security prison in Guadalajara.<BR><BR>--Gilberto Valdes, representing the burgeoning Chiapas cartel.<BR><BR>Conspicuously absent were representatives from the biggest organization of all, the Tijuana cartel, run by the Arellano Felix brothers, posing the possibility of a new war for hegemony by two giant crime blocs.<BR><BR>Mexico's new Attorney General Rafael Macedo, the first military man in that post, told reporters his agents had found no evidence that the meeting took place. But among those reported present at the summit were two men in military uniforms with generals' stars, who were introduced as "representatives of the attorney general's office." The DEA had no comment. --AP, April 9, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Paramilitary Collaborators Fingered in Colombian Army</I></B><BR>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA--The Colombian government claims the country's paramilitary death squads are outlaws--but many Colombian police and military officers actively collaborate with them. Among those fingered by human-rights groups as "the most egregious collaborators" are:<BR><BR>--Gen. Martin Orlando Carreno Sandoval: School of the Americas graduate, former commander of the Army's 17th Brigade in Uraba, and currently a commander of the 5th Brigade in Bucaramanga. The 5th Brigade oversees the violence-torn Magdalena Medio region, where the feared Colombian Self-Defense (AUC) paramilitary terrorizes civilian peasants with impunity. When the village of Valle del Rio Cimitarra proclaimed itself a "peace community," refusing to cooperate with any side in the war, the 5th Brigade launched an economic blockade against the community, prohibiting the entrance or exit of any food or medical products to the population.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, AUC has been able to freely attack the village. Residents have returned to ransacked houses to find notes reading "Palagua Battalion-AUC: Death and Destruction." The Palagua Battalion is a unit of the 5th Brigade under Gen. Carreno's command.<BR><BR>--Brig. Gen. Pablo Alberto Rodriguez Laverde: current commander of the 17th Brigade in Uraba, which has consistently collaborated with paramilitaries to launch attacks on the peace community of San Jose de Apartado. On March 5, plainclothes men burned 15 houses there and ordered everyone to leave. On March 7, Army personnel from the 17th Brigade told a local woman "how sad they were that so many children would soon be crying over their dead parents." They said the Army "couldn't help it, they had given people the opportunity to leave when they burned their houses." Now that people had chosen to stay, "they would have to destroy everything."<BR><BR>--Col. Juan Bautista Yepes Bedoya: School of the Americas graduate, commander of the infamous Heroes de Majagual Battalion in the Magdalena Medio--known as a "torture battalion" to local residents.<BR><BR>--Col. Hernan Dario Moreno Velez: School of the Americas graduate, commands the Nueva Granada Battalion in the city of Barrancabermeja, where the paramilitaries operate with a free hand. On April 7, paramilitary forces held a mandatory "celebration" in the city's Primero de Mayo neighborhood, for which they forced local women to cook food and serve beer. Troops from Col. Moreno's battalion were prominently stationed in the area throughout the day and openly participated in the "celebration": eating, drinking and chatting with paramilitaries. Soldiers in the same district brag of an "arrangement" between their commander and a paramilitary commander named "Salomon."<BR><BR>--Col. Jose Miguel Villar Jimenez: Police Commander in Barrancabermeja. Villar's police are even accused of providing paramilitaries with munitions. --Colombia Support Network (www.colombiasupport.net) press release, April 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Paramilitaries Support Plan Colombia</I></B><BR>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA--Colombian paramilitary troops boasted to a US reporter that their officially illegal terror campaign is indispensable to the US-funded Plan Colombia. An AUC gunman interviewed by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> stated that "Plan Colombia would be almost impossible without the help of the paramilitary forces. If we did not take control of zones ahead of the army, the guerrillas would shoot down their plane." US-funded coca- fumigation efforts are underway in the southern jungle regions of Colombia controlled by the leftist guerillas. Cocaine production in the AUC strongholds of northern Colombia remains unaffected by Plan Colombia, despite the AUC's acknowledgement of involvement in the drug trade. --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, April 12, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Paras Resist New Demilitarized Zone</I></B><BR>BOLIVAR, COLOMBIA--Colombian paramilitaries are advancing toward an area the government wants to cede to leftist guerrillas as a "demilitarized zone" for peace talks, sparking clashes that have killed 11 people. The offensive by the outlawed United Colombian Self-Defense (AUC) came after President Andres Pastrana pulled troops from the territory in Bolivar state to begin talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN). At least seven ELN rebels and four AUC combatants have been killed in the clashes, centered around the villages of Vallecito and Diamante, traditional ELN strongholds. A similar territorial concession was made two years ago to the larger Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), the country's most powerful guerrilla group, but the talks have gone nowhere. Colombia's war has killed nearly 40,000 people, mostly civilians, and displaced 2 million peasants in the last 10 years. --Reuters, April 9, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Is FARC the New Cartel? Pastrana Says No....</I></B><BR>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA--Colombian President Andres Pastrana, trying to broker a peace deal with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), cast doubt on assertions by US officials that the guerrilla group is actually a narcotrafficking mafia. Assistant US Secretary of State Randy Beers recently asserted that the FARC and Colombia's drug cartels "are the same thing," and held out the possibility FARC leaders could be extradited to the United States. But in a Drug War summit with Mexican President Vicente Fox, Pastrana said that "for the moment no proof or evidence exists that the FARC is a drug cartel." Fox echoed Pastrana's comments at a joint news conference, saying there is "no confirmation" that the FARC is selling drugs to the powerful Mexican drug cartels. Pastrana and Fox also criticized Washington's annual "certification" process for Drug War aid. "It is a process that only irritates and offends our countries," Fox said. AP, April 6, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>...Others Say Yes, FARC Is New Cartel</I></B><BR>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA--Less than two weeks after Colombian President Andres Pastrana publicly denounced the idea that the FARC rebels did anything more than tax coca-growers in their region--simultaneously claiming the rebels were not a new "drug cartel"--the Colombian military claimed the capture of a Brazilian drug baron who had been hiding out in the southern Colombian jungle near the Brazilian border. Luis Fernando Da Costa, until his capture Brazil's most wanted drug trafficker, was picked up on Saturday, April 21 with two bodyguards allegedly provided by the FARC after a month-long manhunt.<BR><BR>The Colombian military paraded Da Costa on national television and claimed he had been paying the rebels $10 million monthly in exchange for finished cocaine. The military also claimed he was supplying the FARC with arms. Pastrana has claimed he would never negotiate with drug dealers, and if the military's claims were proven it would jeopardize the entire peace process underway in Colombia. Da Costa, who allegedly once controlled much of the narcotics traffic in Rio de Janeiro, is said to have moved his operations to Colombia after he escaped from a Brazilian prison in 1996. He denied the allegation that he was doing cocaine business with the rebels, and the FARC have also challenged the military version of the story, maintaining that they only tax coca producers and are not involved in the trafficking of the drug.<BR><BR>The drug charges against him in Colombia were almost immediately dropped, and he was deported to Brazil on Tuesday, April 24. --Reuters, April 25, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Peasants Protest Paras</I></B><BR>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA--On March 22, residents of Barrancabermeja and the Cimitarra River Valley, Bolivar Department, occupied the national office of the People's Defender (the government human-rights office) in Bogota. They are staging this direct action to protest government policy in the Magdalena Medio region--including indiscriminate spraying of peasant communities and allowing violent attacks by paramilitaries, which have claimed dozens of lives so far this year. --Colombia Support Network (www.colombiasupport.net), March 24, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Morocco Vows To "Eliminate" Hashish</I></B><BR>RABAT, MOROCCO--In a March meeting, Moroccan government representative Hasan Amrani promised United Nations Drug Czar Pino Arlacchi that hashish production in Morocco will be eliminated within seven years. Morocco is currently the world's leading producer of hashish. The government's pledge to eradicate the cannabis crop represents the first time Morocco has made a formal commitment to eliminating hashish production. --Lindesmith Center newsletter, April 23, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Thailand Gets Ugly</I></B><BR>BANGKOK, THAILAND--Thailand is due to execute three drug offenders in front of live TV cameras to deter traffickers. The three are a 47-year-old man from Hong Kong, a 33-year-old Taiwanese man and a Thai man aged 40. They are to be shot by firing squad. Of the 19 prisoners on death row in Thailand, 11 are convicted drug traffickers. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has vowed to crack down on drugs, instating the death penalty against traffickers for the first time and establishing grueling boot camps for drug offenders. He has also launched military operations to stem the flow of opium from neighboring Burma. The Thai Army recently ambushed a drug caravan in the northwestern Tak province, near the Burmese border. --<i>Ananova</i>, April 18, 2001<BR><BR><B><I>Peru Army Chief Arrested</I></B><BR>LIMA, PERU--Gen. Nicolas Hermoza, head of Peru's armed forces from 1992-98 under recently ousted President Alberto Fujimori, was arrested on charges of taking protection money from drug traffickers. The move came following testimony from convicted kingpin Demetrio Chavez, who also claimed he had paid Fujimori's fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos $50,000 a month for allowing him free use of a jungle airstrip in the Huallaga Valley to ship coca paste to Colombia. Ironically, the arrest came on the anniversary of Fujimori's "self-coup," in which he seized dictatorial powers with Hermoza's cooperation. --AP, April 7, 2001<BR><BR><BR><P ALIGN="right">by Bill Weinberg, Peter Gorman and Steve Wishnia, Special to HighWitness News</FONT></P><br></FONT></font>
