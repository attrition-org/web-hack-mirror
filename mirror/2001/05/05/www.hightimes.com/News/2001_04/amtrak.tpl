<font face="verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="2">
ALBUQUERQUE, NM--In a collaboration reminiscent of Orwell's 1984, the Albuquerque, New Mexico, Amtrak office has been giving passenger information to the local DEA in the hopes of catching drug courriers and earning a ten percent split of any money seized from drug suspects arrested on its trains.<BR>
<BR>
The information--which includes passenger names, whether they used cash or credit cards, where they're coming from and going to, and how long before their journey they bought their tickets--is all turned over to the DEA, which uses it to decide which passengers will be approached on Amtrak trains in Albuquerque. A computer linking DEA to Amtrak sits on a DEA task force-deputized Amtrak investigator's desk, according to a report by the Albuquerque Journal, Wednesday, April 11, 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Asked what would constitute probable cause from that information for the DEA to approach an Amtrak passenger, Debbie Hare, an Amtrak spokesperson commented that she didn't know the answer to that question. "Better ask the DEA.... The DEA has a task force and has agreed they need Amtrak's support for that task force."<BR>
<BR>
More familiar with the way the Amtrak/DEA partnership works is Peter McCue, a Federal defense attorney in Albequerque. "What they do is get the manifest," he told HT. "There's sort of a profile they look for, people who buy tickets shortly before departure, or use cash, things that would be typical of a drug courier." There doesn't appear to be much probable cause for the initial approach to passengers, but according to McCue, "these are consensual searches, so there's no probable cause required. What they do is walk up to someone, with a tape recorder in their pockets, so when they get these cases to court, they've got the whole thing. They walk up and say, 'can I talk to you?' So there is no cause required because technically it is not a stop and frisk."<BR>
<BR>
Asked if he'd ever heard of asset forfeiture going to a corporation or a company employing a deputized agent of the DEA, McCue said, "We've known they were paying for tips, like when a porter might tell them, 'hey, this person looks suspicious,' that resulted in payment of reward. But as far as getting a percentage, no, I didn"t know of that."<BR>
<BR>
"By law, those assets have to go back into law enforcement, and that's exactly where this is going," said Hare, who stresses that all assets siezed and given Amtrak by DEA as a result of passenger "drug activities," go back into Amtrak law enforcement efforts. "In general, when various organizations, local police departments and so forth, cooperate in these kinds of cases, there is an ability for them to get part of the asset forfeiture, but if you want to talk about that, you need to call Justice, because that's a much larger issue," DEA Public Information Officer Rogene Waite told HT. When contacted, the Department of Justice referred HT back to DEA.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Simonson, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Mexico, noted there is a danger that with the DEA using manifests as justification, facts such as surnames, where a passenger is coming from, and payment method lead top profiling, and single out poor and minority passengers. The ACLU Privacy and Racial Profiling divisions are both looking into legal challenges to this policy.<br>
