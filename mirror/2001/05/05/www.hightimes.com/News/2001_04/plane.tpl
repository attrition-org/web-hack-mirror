But that story doesn't hold up to scrutiny.</B></FONT><BR></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><font face="verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="2">IQUITOS, PERU--On Friday, April 20 at 9:43 AM, a US Department of Defense radar aircraft, manned by three former US military men who were under contract to the Central Intelligence Agency and one Peruvian air-force officer, notified the US-controlled radar station at Peru's Morona Cocha military base that it had sighted a plane that had crossed 3-4 miles into Brazilian territory just off the Jivari River, the Peruvian border with Brazil.<BR><BR>According to US officials, a second sighting of the plane occurred 12 minutes later, when the same aircraft re-entered Peruvian airspace. US officials say the American crew then asked Peruvian authorities to determine if the craft had filed a flight plan; when told it hadn't, the Peruvian authorities decided to launch an intercept and attempted to make radio contact. When they couldn't, they began firing, despite the desperate pleas of the CIA-contract pilots to halt the assault.<BR><BR>About one hour and 20 minutes from the time the plane was spotted re-entering Peruvian airspace, it was shot down. Two passengers, 35-year-old missionary Veronica Bowers and Charity, her seven-month-old adopted daughter, were killed in the Peruvian fighter jet's assault on their plane. Two other passengers, Bowers' husband, Jim, 38, and their son, Cory, 7, were uninjured. The pilot, 42-year-old Kevin Donaldson, of Geigertown, Pennsylvania, was shot in the legs and as we go to press is recovering.<BR><BR>On the surface, the story is clean. The US routinely runs radar checks on planes flying in Peru, as part of a program that has been in place since 1995. When they spot a suspected drug plane, Peruvian authorities are alerted and a call made on whether to shoot it out of the sky or try to force it to land. This should be a simple case of mistaken identity and an unfortunate accident, but it may be more than that.<BR><BR>In 1994, the US and Peru came to an agreement on trying to stop the air transport of pasta, coca paste, from Peru, to the refining labs in Colombia. As part of the agreement, which went into effect in 1995, the US built a radar station on the Peruvian military base at Morona Cocha, on the river Nanay, on the outskirts of Iquitos, the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon. The base is run by former US military men, all of whom were Special Forces. The US runs the radar and suggests which planes might be drug planes; the Peruvian air force does the dirty work. The reason for the US running the radar show is to avoid corruption: The thinking is that if the Peruvians identify the drug planes, they will be subject to the temptation of letting certain planes go. If the US identifies which planes are to be taken down, that temptation will be avoided.<BR><BR>But according to Peruvian pilots formerly involved in the program--who for obvious reasons won't give their names--no plane is intercepted or shot down unless the US gives the go-ahead. And this is where the story of the shootdown, as reported in Reuters and the AP begins to fall apart. As of Saturday morning, April 21, the US was claiming that it had no part whatsoever in the tracking of the Bowerses' plane. By that afternoon, President George W. Bush, speaking from the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, Canada, was acknowledging that our plane had identified the Bowerses' plane for the Peruvians and that "we mourn for the loss of the life, two lives," in the incident.<BR><BR>By Sunday morning the US was changing its official story to accept that it had notified Peruvian authorities of the sighting, but was officially claiming that it had tried to prevent the shootdown. "The US crew repeatedly expressed their concern that the nature of the aircraft had not been determined," a US official in Washington told Reuters. "Despite serious concerns raised by the US crew, the shootdown was authorized by Peruvian authorities."<BR><BR>One report had the Peruvian pilots as simply cowboys who shot down the Bowerses' plane against US wishes. While that is not an impossibility, that's not the way it's generally done in Peru. The US calls the shots, period, and as only roughly 40% of the planes they recommend for downing can be connected with the drug trade--again, according to pilots who have been part of the program--Peru takes the public heat for downing innocent planes, but explains that it only does what the US asks, and thus keeps its hands clean. The US makes the calls, but doesn't actually do any shooting; thus it too keeps its hands clean.<BR><BR>The reason so many planes have been downed wrongly is simply the reality of small-plane traffic in the Amazon region of Peru: They're generally old puddle-jumping Cessnas, and very few have any instrumentation left, including radios. Fewer still file flight plans. They're generally piloted by bush pilots who fly by sight at low altitudes, basically running errands for people who live or work out on the rivers in the dense jungle.<BR><BR>This case was different. The Cessna 185 had full instrumentation. Moreover, while the US insists the CIA-contract plane contacted the Peruvian air tower in Iquitos to inquire about the Cessna's flight plan and were told it had none, the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism, for whom the Bowerses worked, claims a flight plan had been filed the day before the shootdown. The Peruvian air tower initially agreed there had been a flight plan filed--showing the plane leaving Iquitos April 19 for Islandia, a tiny Peruvian city on the river border with Brazil, and returning the following day. The Peruvians air controllers later amended their statement to say the plan was filed while the plane was in flight back to Iquitos from Islandia. Two of those three accounts have to be inaccurate.<BR><BR>Moreover, the Bowerses' plane was in regular radio contact with the air tower in Iquitos throughout its flight, including the moment when it was shot down just outside of the river city of Pebas, about 100 air miles outside of Iquitos.<BR><BR>The US version of the story to date is this: The US plane, operated by CIA contract agents, spotted a suspicious plane and alerted the Peruvian authorities to the possibility that it was a drug plane. The Iquitos air tower mistakenly told the US crew that the Bowerses' plane had not filed a flight plan, compounding the suspicions that it was a drug plane. The interceptor jet then tried to reach the Bowerses' plane on the radio but only tried military frequencies, which the Bowerses were not on. The Peruvians then seriously breached military protocol by shooting down the plane, while the US plane heroically and frantically tried to call them off. In sum: The deaths are tragic, but the fault lies with the Peruvians, who made multiple errors and seriously breached standard protocol for the situation.<BR><BR>That story does not hold up to scrutiny and only raises several questions.<BR><BR>First: The shooting occurred more than 160 miles from the original sighting. The Bowers' Cessna 185 has a top speed of 130 MPH. In this case it was probably slower, as it was near a full load, with five passengers. Which means it took 80-90 minutes to reach the intercept point. The Peruvian fighter jet was a Cessna A37B, which has a flight speed of 507 MPH. Taking off from the military airport in Iquitos, it could have made the flight to the intercept point at Pebas in about 15 minutes. So the first question is why did the intercept take place where it did, and not closer to the Brazilian/Peruvian border?<BR><BR>To occur near Pebas means the Peruvian jet either took more than an hour to take off, or the shootdown was purposely timed to occur at Pebas. That it took the Peruvian jet more than an hour to take off seems unreasonable, given that the crew is on 24-hour alert for exactly the purpose of intercepting drug-smuggling planes. That the intercept was timed to occur at Pebas would mean it was intended that there be witnesses to the shootdown--Pebas is the largest city on the Amazon between Iquitos and the Brazilian border, with a population of about 4,000. It also has a Peruvian military base, the closest base along the Peruvian Amazon to the Putumayo River, which is Peru's border with Colombia and territory under the control of Colombia's FARC rebels. The region is currently being militarily bolstered on the Peruvian side in anticipation of the--presumably--imminent start of Plan Colombia bloodshed, which is anticipated to drive FARC rebels across the Putumayo onto Peruvian soil. But if the timing of the shootdown was planned to have it occur near Pebas and in front of witnesses, who stood to gain?<BR><BR>A second question involves the alleged attempts of the Peruvian fighter jet to reach the Bowerses' plane on the radio. That the Bowerses' radio was on and working has been confirmed by the air-traffic controllers in Iquitos. The Peruvian government claims its pilots tried to communicate by radio with the Bowerses' on three separate frequencies during that time. But the Peruvians allegedly only tried to communicate on military frequencies. Why didn't they try the standard commercial frequencies even once during the entire 80-90 minutes between the time they were alerted to the Bowerses' plane's existence and when they shot it down? Was it simply a human error on their part? Or were they under orders or military protocol not to communicate with their target? Human error--simply forgetting to change frequencies--seems unlikely, as these are professional military officers well trained in just this sort of activity. But if they were either under orders not to communicate with their target, or following a military protocol not to communicate with their target, whose orders were they?<BR><BR>A third question relates to what occurred after the Bowerses' plane had made its emergency landing in the Amazon. One wing was already on fire, according to both Jim Bowers and Kevin Donaldson. Yet both Bowers and Donaldson have said the Peruvians continued to strafe them after they landed. Why? It is certainly not normal military protocol unless they were being fired upon, and that concept has not even been raised. Moreover, as there are no roads in the Peruvian Amazon, there was no possibility of escape if the Bowerses had turned out to be drug runners. So why fire on them while they languished in the river? Who ordered that? Were the Peruvians simply bloodthirsty? Or is it possible they realized a terrible mistake had been made, and were trying to ignite the Bowerses' remaining fuel to explode the wreckage and eliminate the evidence of the error?<BR><BR>Another question relates to the initial CIA contract team's identification of the Bowerses' plane as a possible drug-smuggling plane. US procedures demand that US planes attempt to identify planes by their tail numbers. The Bowerses' plane's number was clearly marked, and the US initially did not answer the press' questions regarding the issue. On Tuesday, April 24, four days after the shootdown, the Washington Post reported that US officials had explained that the CIA contract crew had breached its own identification procedures because they were afraid that the suspected drug plane--the Bowers' plane--would flee the country if they got close enough to read the tail numbers. The Post further reported that the US claims the CIA contract crew gave the tail- number identification task to the Peruvians, and that they failed to follow through.<BR><BR>The Peruvians do not agree with the US story. Prime Minister Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary-general, has defended the Peruvian military in the shootdown. On April 24, in his government's first official response to the US allegations that the shootdown was Peru's fault, he said, "For the time being, it would be hasty to say that the Peruvian air force is responsible, or that the pilot of the [missionary] airplane was responsible."<BR><BR>If the events unfolded the way the US claims--although the US story continues to change daily at this point--there are too many unanswered questions. The Bowerses' plane was well known around Iquitos: they had been there a long time and made regular flights from and to the city. Could the Peruvians really have simply shot it on their own? Would the pilots risk their position, and very likely jail time, to shoot down the Bowerses' plane on their own? And even if they were authorized to shoot it down by someone, why would they risk their posts and jail time by continuing to strafe it once it was in flames on the Amazon?<BR><BR>And again, why in front of Pebas, a reasonably good-sized river town with a military base? There were hundreds of witnesses to the entire affair. If there were some reason to want the Bowerses dead--and the continued strafing once it was in the water, with an excellent chance that the machine-gun fire would ignite their fuel and blow the craft to kingdom come, suggests that may have been the case--why do it at Pebas? Between Pebas and the next town toward the Brazilian border, there is a stretch of nearly 100 miles of almost nothing but tiny villages and a leper colony. The Peruvian craft certainly had the speed to intercept at any point along that stretch. Was there a purpose in making the intercept near the closest large town to the Colombian border and FARC territory? Was someone trying to make it look as though the plane was coming out of Colombia?<BR><BR>In truth, Peruvians don't shoot down planes without the OK--and that can be read authorization--of the US. And of all the planes shot down during the several years of the joint US/Peruvian interdiction program--25 are admitted to, though local figures put it several times higher--none has been shot down entering Peruvian airspace. Planes are shot down leaving, because when they leave they are carrying coca paste to Colombia for refining. Pictures of the downed planes with their coca-paste cargo go over well in the Peruvian dailies and continue to impress on Peruvians the need for Uncle Sam to keep coming through with military aid. But planes entering Peruvian airspace, particularly drug-running planes, are entering with cash. Nobody shoots down planes loaded with cash. They are simply forced down so their cash can be confiscated.<BR><BR>So very little of the official US story makes sense the way it was told, unless the Peruvians were completely at fault, either through utter incompetence or malicious intent. But if the official story is a phony, what might the real story be?<BR><BR>One important background event must be put into the equation at this point: On the day the Bowerses' plane was shot down the Third Summit of the Americas was opening in Quebec. With the exception of Fidel Castro, the head of every country in the Americas was present, including George Bush. It was Bush's first summit appearance, and he was pushing the ratification of the Free Trade of the Americas Agreement. In recent weeks he has also changed the name of Clinton's Plan Colombia to the Andes Initiative, and has been working hard to give it his own stamp.<BR><BR>But just weeks before the summit, Uruguayan President Jorge Batlle Ibanez proposed the worldwide legalization of drugs, telling the Washington Post, "Imagine the money you spend to impede drug traffic, and imagine that huge amount of resources on education for the people who really need help." Moreover, he had promised to lobby for drug legalization in a speech in front of all 34 heads of state at the Quebec summit.<BR><BR>Given that as a background, could it be that the downing of the Bowerses' plane was a high-profile antidrug/pro-Andean Initiative publicity stunt that went bad? Would it be a leap to imagine the CIA contract crew--which would be paid by the numbers of planes they intercept--was told it would be just terrific if they managed to intercept a drug-smuggling plane during the summit? Better yet, if it were one thought to be carrying drugs from the FARC rebels, the primary targets of Plan Colombia/the Andean Initiative? The publicity that would generate would completely defuse Batlle's drug- legalization message, by tying drugs to violence and revolutionary movements in bright, bold letters.<BR><BR>Now if that suggestion was made to the US CIA contract crew, and they thought they had a drug-smuggling plane when they caught radar-sight of the Bowerses' Cessna, all of the rest of the questions would be answered: The call was given to the Peruvian authorities to intercept and take down the craft. The location would place the shootdown in front of Pebas, ensuring witnesses and, because of Pebas being less than 60 miles from FARC-held territory in Colombia, the suggestion could be made that it was a FARC drug- smuggling plane. No radio contact was made because the order to kill was given in code by the US. When it was later determined that the Bowerses' plane was not a drug-smuggling plane the US desperately tried to call off the kill. But the order given, it could not be rescinded. Which would explain why the Bowerses' were strafed even after their emergency landing and while their plane was on fire. At that point it would be better to simply explode the plane, to eliminate the evidence and give both the US and Peru more time to come up with credible and matching stories about the shootdown. That scenario would also explain why the US story has changed daily since the shootdown. It would also explain why Peru says it is not at fault in the incident.<BR><BR><B>SIDEBAR</B>Out on the river Nanay, at a resort area called Santo Tomas, a place especially liked by the American military men stationed in Iquitos, the remains of a plane downed in the early stages of the US/Peruvian shootdown program sticks out of the water near the beach. It has been there since 1995. Two stories are told about it:<BR><BR>The Americans say that it was a drug plane confiscated by US DEA agents, who decided to fly it back to Iquitos. But not having filed a flight plan, it was shot down on our say-so. The Americans say they leave it where it is as a reminder not to be so overzealous. The Peruvians say they leave it where it is as a reminder of all the innocent Peruvians who have been mistakenly been shot down on our say-so.<BR><BR>The Bowerses' shootdown is getting press only because they were Americans. It happens all the time in Peru, and no one but the Peruvians notices.<br><BR><BR><P ALIGN="right">by Peter Gorman, Special to HighWitness News</FONT></P><br></FONT></font>
