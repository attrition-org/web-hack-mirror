But what of the people who provide it for them? That issue was at the heart of the prosecution of Ken Hayes and Mike Foley.</B></FONT><BR></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><font face="verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="2">SANTA ROSA, CA--California's first jury trial on the issue of cannabis caregivers in the post-Proposition 215 era was a victory for medical-marijuana advocates, with the acquittal of Ken Hayes, 33, and Mike Foley, 35, on felony cultivation and possessio n charges <BR><BR>in Sonoma County Superior Court on April 18. Prop 215, the Compassionate Use Act, legalized cannabis use by patients and its growth by "caregivers" (those who grow and provide medical pot). The verdict could shape the debate as to whether medical-cannabis clubs can be legal caregivers, as the law does not address where patients can obtain cannabis. "It will help define what is a caregiver," says Bill Panzer, Hayes' attorney and coauthor of Prop 215. "It's not binding, but other DAs and judges can see that an individual can be a caregiver, even for 1,200 people."<BR><BR>Hayes was the former executive director of CHAMP--an acronym for Cannabis Helping Alleviate Medical Problems--a 1,280-member cannabis club located in San Francisco's Castro district. Foley formerly managed CHAMP's dispensary.<BR><BR>The seven-week trial, which Panzer termed "a waste of taxpayers' time and money," was atypical from the start. The defense's first witness was San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan (Interview, Aug. '01 HT). He was subsequently cross- examined by a former intern from his own office. There was also a charge of "black-market secret codes" being used by the defendants, and even a reference to HIGH TIMES during the trial's often heated and emotional testimony.<BR><BR>Hayes and Foley were arrested on May 14, 1999, when the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department's Narcotics Task Force raided their rented house and barn on a rural farm in Petaluma, recovering 899 cannabis plants growing in six greenhouses and in the barn. Also found were fifteen pounds of dried bud, one pound of hashish, $3,700 in cash and a rifle with a mounted telescope sight. Hayes' defense maintained the rifle was only used to protect Hayes' chickens from raccoons, and that 145 of the "plants" were actually unrooted cuttings.<BR><BR>Hayes and Foley faced felony charges of unlawful cultivation and possession of concentrated cannabis for the purpose of sale, as the Sonoma County prosecution, led by Carla Claeys, unsuccessfully attempted to portray them as "black-market conspirators," using their status as caregivers as cover to generate $500,000 in profits from pot sales.<BR><BR>Panzer explained to the jury that Hayes was a designated caregiver who delivered cannabis free of charge to the members of CHAMP. Hayes operated with the complete knowledge of the San Francisco Police Department and Hallinan's office. CHAMP was also lauded by Mayor Willie Brown and the city Board of Supervisors. This trial also pitted the two counties' DAs against each other, with their conflicting mentalities and approaches towards caregivers and cannabis clubs. In San Francisco, there is the progressive, pro- Prop 215 Hallinan, while Sonoma DA Mike Mullins regards all cannabis clubs as illegal, and resents his county being used to grow medicinal pot for CHAMP. Mullins told the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, "If San Francisco wants to have a medical-marijuana supplier, they can grow it in Golden Gate Park."<BR><BR>While Hallinan was quoted as saying he didn't want to "duel" with Mullins, Panzer did not refrain from criticizing the Sonoma DA, comparing him to the infamous segregationist George Wallace trying to prevent black students from entering the University of Alabama after they were given the right by the Supreme Court.<BR><BR>On March 27, the two DAs' differences came to a head with Hallinan's appearance on the stand. Before a standing-room-only courtroom, under direct examination from Panzer, he told the jury that he regards Ken Hayes as the primary caregiver for members of CHAMP, that Hayes and Foley were operating within the guidelines of the law and that their case never would have been prosecuted in San Francisco. He said the "tricky part" for cannabis clubs was obtaining medical pot that wasn't connected to the black market. Under cross-examination by Claeys, Hallinan disclosed he knew few details about CHAMP's grow operation on the Petaluma farm. Panzer objected stridently to much of her questioning.<BR><BR>Ironically, Claeys served as an intern in Hallinan's office as a law student in 1996. It may have appeared to be a case of the student besting the teacher when she had Hallinan read his ballot argument for Prop 215 in 1996, where he wrote the initiative would not permit, "unlimited quantities of marijuana to be grown anywhere. It only allows marijuana to be grown for a patient's personal use. Police officers can still arrest anyone who grows too much or tries to sell it."<BR><BR>Claeys was trying to imply that 899 plants was an "unlimited quantity," yet Hallinan's arguments for Prop 215 in '96 apply to Hayes' and Foley's defense in 2001. They were not growing for profit, but to provide CHAMP with ample medicine, and they were not just cultivating the medical cannabis "anywhere," but inside of greenhouses on property they were legally renting.<BR><BR>Hallinan said Hayes was growing to keep the costs down and to ensure the cannabis would not contain insecticides or pesticides. While acknowledging that Prop 215 applies to individual patients and their caregivers, he declared that individual patients could designate a cannabis club as their caregiver.<BR><BR>Midway through the trial, outside the courtroom, came a bizarre episode involving prosecutor Claeys. In an incident confirmed by DA Mullins, she went to a local shooting range and fired at two silhouettes that "someone" had labeled "Panzer" and "DeFever," for Foley's attorney, J. Nicole DeFever.<BR><BR>Bill Panzer considers Claeys' actions as a "terrorist threat" against him and DeFever. He intends to notify the state bar association and possibly the state attorney general's office about her conduct.<BR><BR>There is the possibility Claeys was just venting her frustration with the gun, as her relative inexperience in the courtroom was no match for Panzer, a knowledgeable attorney and skilled orator. Back in court, Sonoma Sheriff's Deputy Steve Gossett, part of the squad that busted Hayes and Foley, admitted he actually has a subscription to HIGH TIMES, in order to learn the yield prices for marijuana sold for profit.<BR><BR>Hayes testified for three emotional hours on April 9, describing how he also made cannabis purchases for CHAMP in addition to his cultivation, and that the cultivators he bought from were assigned secret code names. The narcotics officers misinterpreted these scraps of paper to conclude Hayes was selling cannabis on the black market.<BR><BR>Hayes said he used the codes because he wanted to avoid getting too much information from the growers, including their names, because "what they were doing was technically illegal."<BR><BR>In closing arguments, defense attorney DeFever referred to the trial as a "righteous case," stating her client's actions were protected by Prop 215. She also attacked the "black-market sales" angle, because each bag was labeled, she said, ' " for medical use only and not for resale.' That's not exactly a drug dealer's tactic." Prosecutor Claeys opted to wave a large cannabis bud in front of the jury, perhaps to play on the image of the "black-market drug," as she repeated the prosecution's charge that "this is about money."<BR><BR>Panzer argued Hayes didn't sell the medical marijuana obtained from the "secret code" dealers, but rather, received consignments from 25 different cannabis vendors, who were paid only after patients received their medicine.<BR><BR>He again referenced the Sonoma County DA in his closing arguments, "Mike Mullins is one of these people who doesn't like this law [Prop 215]," he told the jury, "and you have an opportunity to send him a message right now."<BR><BR>The eight-male, four-female jury proceeded to do just that, delivering the not-guilty verdicts that resulted in Hayes and Foley sharing a triumphant hug and a few tears in the courtroom. Afterwards, Ken Hayes told the Chronicle that he pledges to continue to serve, "sick and dying people" by providing medical cannabis.<BR><BR>Hayes is also involved with the movement to recall any county DA in California who opposes Prop 215 (such as Marin County DA Paula Kamena), and promised if Mullins doesn't change his politics, "he is gone too."<BR><BR>The verdict seemed to soften Mullins' stance, as he told the <i>Chronicle</i> that since the jury has said a large growing operation can be a primary caregiver, it is imperative the state Legislature devise a medical-marijuana distribution system to protect the grower.<BR><BR>Panzer aptly summed up the reality of this case, "The jury obviously reaffirmed what people voted for on Prop 215. They [Hayes and Foley] were providing medicine to needy people, they were not making money."<br><BR><BR><P ALIGN="right">by Mark Miller, Special to HighWitness News</FONT></P><br></FONT></font>
