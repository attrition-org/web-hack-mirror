my last site in this so called cyber war turned ugly. Im saddened by the outcome of this all. When it first started with  
myself poisonb0x and the chinese crackers - it wasnt hateful towards each other - maybe some petty instigating - but
anything serious was directed towards the others government. Now - thanks to contributions from reporters full of
assumptions this has turned into a media frenzy - drawing out the worst in the US hackers. When I started reading sites   
calling the chinese gooks and worse - with pornographics images - and hateful comments - I was embarrassed for us. The    
chinese have maintained a pretty clean approach to this whole thing and not gotten too personnal - save some of the US pig
comments - which were mostly directed at the government. When I first started with this it was only for fun - bragging    
rights between two countries hacker communities. I wish it would have stayed there - but it didnt. <P><P> To the US
hackers who have become hateful and racial - you need to grow up and take a look at your politics and your attitude
towards humanity. <P><P> To the Chinese hackers - you proved me wrong and stepped up to the plate nailing alot of our
servers. I still think were better though. grin. <P><P> This will be my last site as I said - To avoid trouble and also to
urge others to just drop this already - on both sides. <P><P>puhrahfit@hushmail.com - pr0phet
