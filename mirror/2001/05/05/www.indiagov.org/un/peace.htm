<P>In keeping with the purposes enshrined in the Charter, the United Nations
has established peacekeeping operations in various parts of the world.
The nature of these operations has evolved over a period of time. They
range from simple observer missions to peace enforcement and multi-dimensional
operations. A total of 49 operations have been established in over 50 years
of the UN's existence.</P>

<P>As the UN Secretary General has noted in his report <I>Supplement to
An Agenda for Peace</I>, respect for certain basic principles of peacekeeping
is essential to its success. Three particularly important principles that
underline these operations are consent, impartiality and minimum use of
force except in self-defence. The UN operations symbolize the collective
will of the international community, which gives them unique authority.
The universality of the UN peacekeeping operations, in terms of their composition
and objectives, distinguishes them from military action by individual or
a group of member states. Arms are resorted to maintain and restore international
peace and security and not in the quest for territorial expansion or strategic
gain.</P>

<P>While the UN Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance
of international peace and security under the Charter, the UN General Assembly
too has an important role. In fact, the Council's authority is derived
from the General Assembly. Article 24 of the Charter states that in order
to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its members
confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance
of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its
duties under this responsibility, the Security Council acts on their behalf.
The role of the General Assembly in the maintenance of international peace
and security was also recognized in the <I>Uniting for Peace </I>Resolution
of the General Assembly. It is reflected in the work of the Special Committee
on UN Peacekeeping, which debates every aspect of peacekeeping activities.
The role of the General Assembly in post-conflict peace-building is almost
universally recognized. The General Assembly also approves the budget for
UN peacekeeping.</P>

<P>The Special Committee on UN Peacekeeping in its report to 53rd UN General
Assembly session stressed that peacekeeping operations should strictly
observe the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.
It emphasised respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity
and political independence of States, as well as non-intervention in matters
that are essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. It also stressed
the importance of peacekeeping operations being provided with clearly defined
mandates, objectives and command structures, as well as secure financing.</P>

<P>After touching a peak of 73,393 in 1994, the number of military personnel
deployed in UN peacekeeping operations has come down to around 14,500 in
1998. These personnel are deployed in 17 peacekeeping operations around
the globe. This includes six in Europe, four in the Middle-East, four in
Africa, two in Asia and one in the Americas. The UN operations have become
increasingly complex in their mandate and functions and often include civilian
police observers, humanitarian assistance and electoral assistance as their
components.</P>

<P>The level of UN peacekeeping activities has been affected by the problem
of arrears of payment of assessed contribution to the UN peacekeeping budget.
The UN's peacekeeping budget has steadily declined from US $ 3.193 billion
in 1994 to US $ 907.5 million in 1998. The shrinking resources are bound
to affect the level of UN peacekeeping activities as well as participation
by developing countries.</P>
