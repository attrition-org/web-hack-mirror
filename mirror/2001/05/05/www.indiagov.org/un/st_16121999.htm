<p><b><font color="#993300"><font size=+3>A</font></font></b>s the regular
session of the 54th General Assembly draws to a close we are once again
considering all aspects of the question of increase in the membership of
the Security Council and to effectively address other matters related to
the reform of the Council. Six years have elapsed since we began discussing
this vital question in the Open ended Working Group and yet even as a new
century dawns, consensus continues to elude us. The time has surely come
for some introspection on our part. Perhaps one of the reassons it has
taken so long is simply because somewhere along the line we have lost sight
of what it was that we had set out to do. We need once again to address
the fundamental question: Is security Council reform an essential prerequisite
for better functioning of our organisation ? We believe that the answer
to this question is unequivocally in the affirmative.
<p>2.We have come a long way since discussions began on this issue. It
would be unrealistic and indeed unfair to call our discussions an exercise
in futility.We are not reform pessimists. National interests on such a
vital question may take time to reconcile. What is essential for the success
of negotiations is investment of political will, which is not yet in evidence
in the measures required. Then again we need to ask ourselves: Should we
be aspiring to a utopion solution or are we prepared to accept a less than
ideal solution that could take into account current global realities and
yet provide to the Security Council the balance and expansion it so vitally
and urgently requires, the necessity for which we have elaborated upon
in several previous statements.
<p>3. The expansion and reform of the Security Councl must equip it to
face the challenges of the next century. A comprehensive package which
include an expansion of the council membership improvement in its working
methods and changes in the process of decision making has become imperative.
Any attempts to limit this exercise to a piecemeal expansion to the detriment
of developing countries would not only weaken the Council creditibility
further but would also nullify the basic need to impart greater democratisation
and transparency to the council working. The impact of the absence of representation
of developing countries as permanent members is seen everywhere - on the
countries and problems which are before the Security Council, the Council
as an institution the permanent members seeking to resolve the crises and
indeed the UN itself; which ultimately has to shoulder the blame when the
Council decisions go awry. We have had occasion to make this point at greater
length in the Open Ended Working Group NAM which is the single largest
group of member states with 114 members, continues to be unrepresented
in the permanent members category, This anomaly needs to be corrected.
NAM should also have an enhanced presence in the non permanent category.
<p>4 While on the one hand the Council has evaded its role or let it be
usurped, on the other there are calls for far greater activism on its part
to effectively tackle humanitarian crises. We have serious reservations
over the council addressing issues beyond its competence; unless a humanitarian
crises clearly poses a threat to international peace and security, the
Council has no role in attempts to resolve it. While this is a general
principle which should be respected the composition of and the balance
of power in the Council so heavily weighted against developing countries
is an added cause of concern because objects of humanitarian activism can
only be countries in the developing world. A Security Council, which is
representative and undemocratic can neither preserve international peace
nor legitimately speak on behalf of the general membership. It should certainly
not try to stretch the limits of what is politically acceptable to the
general membership.
<p>5. Partial solutions are no solutions at all. After striving for over
six years if we were to agree to an expansion of the security Council in
the non permanent category only or if we were to make cosmetic changes
in its working methods, we would be doing a disservice not only to ourselves
but to the Organistion as a whole. Instead of addressing the key issues
we would be skirting them and perpetuating an international system by inequity.
<p>Mr President,
<p>6. We should resist the temptation of taking the easier option and promoting
agreement only on those issues on which there already exists a broad measure
of convergence. Cluster I and Cluster II issues are equally important and
have to be addressed together. NAM has consistently argued that expansion
and reform of the Security Council should be intergral parts of a a common
package. Any attempts to promote one at the cost of the other is not only
a negation of the NAM position but would also undermine the mandate given
by the General Assembly to consider all aspects of the question of the
increase in the membership of the Security Council and to effectively address
other matters related to the reform of the Council. We also believe that
creating a third category of membership based on rotation would not meet
the aspirations of developing countries as they would continue to be subjected
to a discrimimtory regime. However, we would like to reiterate that we
reflect the position of the OAU. As the African group has itself emphasised
their option is not intended to serve as a model for others.
<p>Mr.President,
<p>7. Some other points that bear reiteration are that any increase in
permanent membership should be guided by objective, and not subjective,
selective or arbitrary criteria. The manner of selection of all new permanent
members should be uniform. The General Assembly is the forum which should
elect new permanent members. There should be no constraint on the role
or authority of the General Assembly in this regard. All new permanent
members should be designated together.
<p>8. On the question of periodic review of an enlarged Security Council
we believe that such an exercise would inherently promote greater accountability
and responsibility among members of the Council and should have universal
application.
<p>9.An inhibiting factor in the process of the Councils expansion has
been the reluctance of some to show flexibility on the size of an expanded
Council, preferring presumed comfort in numbers over effectiveness, The
latter can only be achieved by in expanded Council, which draws its legitimacy
by commmanding greater support of the member states. The difference in
numbers is such as threatens to resemble a debate of scholastic theology.
<p>Mr President,
<p>India has steadfastly contributed to all aspects of the Organisation's
activities. We believe that on any objective grounds India would be considered
qualified for permanent membership of an expanded Security Council whenever
the membership finds this decision posed before it. The pace is for the
membership to decide but we believe that undue declaration in the consideration
of this vital question is not in our collective interest.
<p>11. We welcome the adoption by consensus of Resolution 53/30 by the
General Assembly last year. This has clearly laid down the voting threshold
for adoption of any resolution or decision on Security Council restructuring.
With this procedural issue behind us the way ahead would be to address
all the issues in a comprehensive manner and evolve the broadest possible
agreement on any package. It is heartening to note that a tentative beginning
was made in the Open Ended Working Group this year which included in its
report a new chapter on "General Observations". We could seek to build
on the consensus reached in elements contained in the report. Moreover
Mr President we would like to encourage you to try and ascertain the views
of all members states. A beginning was made by your predecessor and there
is a need to carry this process forward.
<p>12.We look forward to resuption of deliberations in the Open Ended Working
Group next year with a view to moving forward discussions on Security Council
reform. By generating the necessary political will there are no obstacles
that are insurmountable. The challenges that confront us should only redouble
our determination to press on. This century has been an eloquent testimony
to the limitless expanse of the human possibility and creativity. Hurdles
should not deter us. We have great faith in your leadership, Mr President
and in the collective wisdom of this truly universal organistaions of ours.&nbsp;
