Representative of India to the United Nations, H.E. Ambassador Kamalesh
Sharma today met the Under Secretary General for Legal Affairs, Mr. Hans
Corell and deposited India's instruments of ratification of the following
Protocols of the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions restructions on the Use
of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To be Excessively Injurious
or to Have Indiscriminate Effects:</P>

<P>1. Protocol on Prohibition or Restrictions on the use of Mines, Booby
Traps and other Devices as Amended on 3 May 1996 (Amended Protocol II).</P>

<P>2. Additional Protocol on Bliding Laser weapons (Protocol IV)</P>

<P>Amended Protocol II to the Convention which was adopted by the Review
Conference in Geneva on May 3, 1996 prohibits the use of non- detachable
anti- personnel mines. It stipulates that all mines produced after 1 January
1997 must contain at least eight grams of iron or equivalent to make their
detection easier and removal less hazardous. The scope of application of
the Protocol has also been extended to cover &quot;armed conflicts not
of an international charactar&quot;.</P>

<P>The other main features of the revised Protocol are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>prohibition of the use of mines designed to detonate during detection
operations;</LI>

<LI>Prohibiton of the use of any mine, booby-trap devices designed or of
a nature to cause superflous injury</LI>

<LI>restrictions of the use of remotely delivered mines which will have
to be constructed so that they self destruct within 30 days of emplacement
with 90 percent reliability . Such mines must also have a &quot;back up
self-deactivation feature&quot; </LI>

<LI>the need for mines delivered non remotely outside marked areas also
to adhere to these requirements.</LI>

<LI>application of the new restrictions not only to a states but &quot;to
parties to a conflict&quot;.</LI>
</UL>

<P>States Parties undertake not to transfer any mines prohibited by the
protocol . For monitoring compliance, States parties to hold annual meetings
to discuss implementation of the amended Protocol.</P>

<P>Protocol IV on bliding laser weapons which was adopted on October 13,
1995 by the Review Conference held in Vienna prohibits the use of laser
weapons specificaly designed to cause permanent blindness. It represents
a significant breakthrough in international humanitarian law and the prohibition
of an abhorent new weapon whose production and proliferation appeared imminent
is a historic step for humanity. This is the first time since the use of
exploding bullets was prohibited in 1868 that a weapon of military utility
has been banned before it has been used on the battle field and before
a vast number of victims have given visible proof of its tragic effects.</P>

<P>This new protocol prohibits both the use and the transfer of laser weapons
specifically designed to cause permanent blindness as one of new combat
functions. This is the first time that both the use and the transfer of
a weapons have been entirely prohibited under international humanitarian
law.</P>

<P>India has always maintained a moratorium on exports of landmine and
and has been contributing to international efforts in dealing with the
humanitarium tragedy caused by the irresponsible export and use of anti-personnel
landmines. For over three decades the Indian armed forces have contributed
to de-minning operations under the aegis of the United Nations in different
countries including Angola, Bosnia, Congo, Cambodia, Mozambique and Somalia.</P>
