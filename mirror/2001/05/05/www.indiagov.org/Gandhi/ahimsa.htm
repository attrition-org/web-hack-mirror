<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>I
have nothing new to teach the world. Truth and Non-violence are as old
as the hills. All I have done is to try experiments in both on as vast
a scale as I could. In doing so I have sometimes erred and learnt by my
errors. Life and its problems have thus become to me so many experiments
in the practice of truth and non-violence. As a Jain <I>muni</I> once rightly
said I was not so much a votary of <I>ahimsa</I> as I was of truth, and
I put the latter in the first place and the former in the second. For,
as he put it, I was capable of sacrificing non-violence for the sake of
Truth. In fact it was in the course of my pursuit of truth that I discovered
non-violence. </P>

<P>Truth and Love - <A HREF="../Gandhi1/nonviolence.htm"><I>ahimsa</I>
</A>- is the only thing that counts. Where this is present, everything
rights itself in the end. This is a law to which there is no exception.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 18.8.1927</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>To see the universal and all-pervading spirit of Truth face to face
one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself. And a man
who aspires after that cannot afford to keep out of any field of life.
That is why my devotion to Truth has drawn me into the field of politics;
and I can say without the slightest hesitation, and yet in all humility,
that those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not
know what religion means. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Autobiography, p.370</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My uniform experience has convinced me that there is no other God than
Truth.... The little fleeting glimpses that I have been able to have of
Truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of Truth, a
million times more intense than that of the sun we daily see with our eyes.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 7.2.1929</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I am not a visionary. I claim to be a practical idealist. The religion
of non-violence is not meant merely for the <I>rishis</I> and saints. It
is meant for the common people as well. Non-violence is the law of our
species as violence is the law of the brute. The spirit lies dormant in
the brute and he knows no law but that of physical might. The dignity of
man requires obedience to a higher law - to the strength of the spirit.
</P>

<P>The <I>rishis</I> who discovered the law of non-violence in the midst
of violence were greater geniuses than Newton. They were themselves greater
warriors than Wellington. Having themselves known the use of arms, they
realised their uselessness, and taught a weary world that its salvation
lay not through violence but through non-violence. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 11.8.1920</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I learnt the lesson of non-violence from my wife, when I tried to bend
her to my will. Her determined resistance to my will, on the one hand,
and her quiet submission to the suffering my stupidity involved, on the
other, ultimately made me ashamed of myself and cured me of my stupidity
in thinking that I was born to rule over her and, in the end, she became
my teacher in non-violence. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 24.12.1938</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P><A HREF="../Gandhi1/nonviolence.htm">Non-violence</A> is an active force
of the highest order. It is soul force or the power of Godhead within us.
Imperfect man cannot grasp the whole of that Essence - he would not be
able to bear its full blaze, but even an infinitesimal fraction of it,
when it becomes active within us, can work wonders. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 12.11.1935</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>The fact is that non-violence does not work in the same way as violence.
It works in the opposite way. An armed man naturally relies upon his arms.
A man who is intentionally unarmed relies upon the Unseen Force called
God by poets, but called the Unknown by scientists. But that which is unknown
is not necessarily non-existent. God is the Force among all forces known
and unknown. Non-violence without reliance upon that Force is poor stuff
to be thrown in the dust. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 28.6.1942</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Without <I>ahimsa</I> it is not possible to seek and find Truth. <I>Ahimsa</I>
and Truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to disentangle
and separate them. They are like the two sides of a coin, or rather of
a smooth, unstamped, metallic disc. Who can say which is the obverse, and
which is the reverse? Nevertheless <I>ahimsa</I> is the means; Truth is
the end. Means to be means must always be within our reach, and so <I>ahimsa</I>
is our supreme duty. If we take care of the means, we are bound to reach
the end sooner or later. When once we have gasped this point, final victory
is beyond question. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From Yeravda Mandir: Ashram Observances</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My non-violence does not admit of running away from danger and leaving
dear ones unprotected. Between violence and cowardly flight, I can only
prefer violence to cowardice. I can no more preach non-violence to a coward
than I can tempt a blind man to enjoy healthy scenes. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 28.5.1924</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Non-violence is not a cover for cowardice, but it is the supreme virtue
of the brave. Exercise of non-violence requires far greater bravery than
that of swordsmanship. Cowardice is wholly inconsistent with non-violence.
Translation from swordsmanship to non-violence is possible and, at times,
even an easy stage. Non-violence, therefore, pre-supposes ability to strike.
It is a conscious deliberate restraint put upon one's desire for vengeance.
But vengeance is any day superior to passive, effeminate and helpless submission.
Forgiveness is higher still. Vengeance too is weakness. The desire for
vengeance comes out of fear of harm, imaginary or real. A dog barks and
bites when he fears. A man who fears no one on earth would consider it
too troublesome even to summon up anger against one who is vainly trying
to injure him. </P>
