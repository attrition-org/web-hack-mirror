<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>To
call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to woman. If
by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute
than man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably
man's superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing,
has she not greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without
her man could not be. If non-violence is the law of our being, the future
is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart than woman?
</P>

<P>Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacities.
She has the right to participate in very minutest detail in the activities
of man and she has an equal right of freedom and liberty with him. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Speeches and Writings of Mahatma Gandhi; Natesan,
Madras, 1933</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>If only the women of the world would come together they could display
such heroic non-violence as to kick away the atom bomb like a mere ball.
Women have been so gifted by God. If an ancestral treasure lying buried
in a corner of the house unknown to the members of the family were suddenly
discovered, what a celebration it would occasion. Similarly, women's marvellous
power is lying dormant. If the women of Asia wake up, they will dazzle
the world. My experiment in non-violence would be instantly successful
if I could secure women's help. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Message to Chinese Women, 18.7.1947</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I would love to find that my future army contained a vast preponderance
of women over men. If the fight came, I should then approach it with much
greater confidence than if men predominated. I would dread the latter's
violence. Women would be my guarantee against such an outbreak. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 2.12.1939</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P><I>Ahimsa</I> means infinite love, which again means infinite capacity
for suffering. Who but woman, the mother of man, shows this capacity in
the largest measure? She shows it as she carries the infant and feeds it
during nine months and derives joy in the suffering involved. What can
beat the suffering caused by the pangs of labour? But she forgets them
in the joy of creation. Who again suffers daily so that her babe may wax
from day to day? Let her transfer that love to the whole of humanity, let
her forget that she ever was or can be the object of man's lust. And she
will occupy her proud position by the side of man as his mother, maker
and silent leader. It is given to her to teach the art of peace to the
warring world thirsting for that nectar. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 24.2.1940</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My suggestion is that women can play a very important role in establishing
peace. Instead of being carried away by science they should follow the
path of non-violence because women by nature are endowed with the quality
of forgiveness. Women will never succeed in aping men in everything, nor
can they develop the gift nature has bestowed on them by doing so. They
should neither allow their family members to have, nor should they themselves
have any connection with anything relating to war. God has endowed women
with hearts overflowing with love. They should utilise the gift properly.
That power is all the more effective because it is mute. I hold that God
has sent women as messengers of the gospel of non-violence. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(CWMG, Vol. LXXXVII</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>But it is my firm conviction that if the men and women of India cultivate
in themselves the courage to face death bravely and non-violently, they
can laugh to scorn the power of armaments and realise the ideal of unadulterated
independence in terms of the masses which would serve as an example to
the world. In that women can take the lead for they are a personification
of the power of self-suffering. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Mahatma Gandhi, the last phase, Vol. II</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>The women of India have during the past twelve months worked wonders
on behalf of the motherland. You have silently worked away as angels of
mercy. You have parted with your cash and your fine jewellery. You have
wandered from house to house to make collections. Some of you have even
assisted in picketing. Some of you who were used to fine dresses of variegated
colours and had a number of changes during the day have now adopted the
white and spotless but heavy khadi sari reminding one of a woman's innate
purity. You have done all this for the sake of India, for the sake of <I>Khilafat</I>,
for the sake of the Punjab. There is no guide about your word or work.
Yours is the purest sacrifice untainted by anger or hate. Let me confess
to you that your spontaneous and loving response all over India has convinced
me that God is with us. No other proof of our struggle being one of self-purification
is needed than that lakhs of India's women are actively helping it. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 11.8.1921</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Here as elsewhere the part played by women is indescribable. When the
history of this movement comes to be written, the sacrifices made by the
women of India will occupy the foremost place and just as with women so
also with children. Their wonderful awakening has fortified me in my faith
that God is with us in this struggle. These young folk had never been organised
for such work, never been trained for it. How they came to achieve all
this I have not been able to divine nor has anyone else whom I have consulted
been able to enlighten [me] as to who guided them; only God could have
done so. But remember that, in the sacred battle, whatever sacrifices you
have made are trifling. Let them not puff you up with pride, what we want
for India is <I><A HREF="swaraj.htm">purna swaraj</A>.</I> And who can
calculate what further sacrifices India will have to make to achieve that
goal? I assure you that I am doing as much as is humanly possible to bring
about peace so that the people may not have to go through further suffering
and sacrifices but everything is in God's hands and if it be not His will
that any understanding be arrived at, then I will have to tell the people
that they must be ready for much further suffering. </P>
