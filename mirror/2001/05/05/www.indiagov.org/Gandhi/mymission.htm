<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>I
am an humble seeker after truth. I am impatient to realise myself, to attain
<I>moksha</I> in this very existence. My national service is part of my
training for freeing my soul from the bondage of flesh. Thus considered,
my service may be regarded as purely selfish. I have no desire for the
perishable kingdom of earth. I am striving for the Kingdom of Heaven which
is <I>moksha</I>. To attain my end it is not necessary for me to seek the
shelter of a cave. I carry one about me, if I would but know it. For me
the road to salvation lies through incessant toil in the service of my
country and of humanity. I want to identify myself with everything that
lives. In the language of the <I>Gita</I> I want to live at peace with
both friend and foe. Though, therefore, a Mussalman or a Christian or a
Hindu may despise me and hate me, I want to love him and serve him even
as I would love my wife or son though they hate me. So my patriotism is
for me a stage in my journey to the land of eternal freedom and peace.
Thus it will be seen that for me there are no politics devoid of religion.
They subserve religion. Politics bereft of religion are a death-trap because
they kill the soul. </P>

<P>The heart's earnest and pure desire is always fulfilled. In my own experience,
I have often seen this rule being verified. Service of the poor has been
my heart's desire and it has always thrown me amongst the poor and enabled
me to identify myself with them. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Autobiography, p.110</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My life is an indivisible whole, and all my activities run into one
another; and they all have their rise in my insatiable love of mankind.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 2.3.1934</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I have not conceived my mission to be that of a knight-errant wandering
everywhere to deliver people from difficult situations. My humble occupation
has been to show people how they can solve their own difficulties. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 28.6.1942</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My mission is to teach by example and precept under severe restraint
the use of the matchless weapon of <I><A HREF="satyagrahya.htm">satyagraha</A></I>,
which is a direct corollary of non-violence and truth. I am anxious, indeed
I am impatient, to demonstrate that there is no remedy for the many ills
of life save that of non-violence..... </P>

<P>When I have become incapable of evil and when nothing harsh or haughty
occupies, be it momentarily, my thought-world, then, and not till then,
my non-violence will move all the hearts of all the world. I have placed
before me and the reader no impossible ideal or ordeal. It is man's prerogative
and birth-right. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 2.7.1925</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My mission is not merely brotherhood of Indian humanity. My mission
is not merely freedom of India, though today it undoubtedly engrosses practically
the whole of my life and whole of my time. But, through realisaiton of
freedom of India, I hope to realise and carry on the mission of brotherhood
of man. </P>

<P>My patriotism is not an exclusive thing. It is all embracing and I should
reject that patriotism which sought to mount upon the distress or exploitation
of other nationalities. The conception of my patriotism is nothing if it
is not always, in every case without exception, consistent with the broadest
good of humanity at large. </P>

<P>Not only that, but my religion and my patriotism derived from my religion
embrace all life. I want to realise brotherhood or identity not merely
with the beings called human, but I want to realise identity with all life,
even with such things as crawl upon earth because we claim descent from
the same God, and that being so, all life in whatever form it appears must
be essentially one. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 4.4.1929</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I have that implicit faith in my mission that, if it succeeds - as it
will succeed, it is bound to succeed - history will record it as a movement
designed to knit all people in the world together, not as hostile to one
another but as parts of one whole. </P>
