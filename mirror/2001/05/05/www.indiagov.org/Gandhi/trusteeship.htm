<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>Supposing
I have come by a fair amount of wealth - either by way of legacy, or by
means of trade and industry - I must know that all that wealth does not
belong to me; what belongs to me is the right to an honourable livelihood,
no better is the right to an honourable livelihood, no better than that
enjoyed by millions of others. The rest of my wealth belongs to the community
and must be used for the welfare of the community. I enunciated this theory
when the socialist theory was placed before the country in respect to the
possessions held by zamindars and ruling chiefs. They would do away with
these privileged classes. I want them to outgrow their greed and sense
of possession, and to come down in spite of their wealth to the level of
those who earn their bread by labour. The labourer has to realize that
the wealthy man is less owner of his wealth than the labourer is owner
of his own, viz., the power to work.</P>

<P>I have no hesitation in endorsing the proposition that generally rich
men and for that matter most men are not particular as to the way they
make money. In the application of the method of non-violence, one must
believe in the possibility of every person, however depraved, being reformed
under humane and skilled treatment. We must appeal to the good in human
beings and expect response. Is it not conducive to the well-being of society
that every member uses all his talents, only not for personal aggrandizement
but for the good of all? We do not want to produce a dead equality where
every person becomes or is rendered incapable of using his ability to the
utmost possible extent. Such a society must ultimately perish. I therefore
suggest that my advice that moneyed men may earn their crores (honestly
only, of course) but so as to dedicate them to the service of all is perfectly
sound. <I>Tyen Tyeyektena Bunjhitha </I>is a mantra based on uncommon knowledge.
It is the surest method to evolve a new order of life of universal benefit
in the place of the present one where each one lives for himself without
regard to what happens to his neighbour.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Harijan, 22-2-1942</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Working for economic equality means abolishing the eternal conflict
between capital and labour. It means the levelling down of the few rich
in whose hands is concentrated the bulk of the nation's wealth on the one
hand, and a levelling up of the semi-starved, naked millions on the other.
A non-violent system of government is clearly an impossibility so long
as the wide gulf between the rich and the hungry millions persists. The
contrast between the palaces of New Delhi and the miserable hovels of the
poor labouring class nearby cannot last one day in a free India in which
the poor will enjoy the same power as the richest in the land. A violent
and bloody revolution is a certainty one day, unless there is a voluntary
abdication of riches and the power that riches give and sharing them for
the common good.</P>

<P>If, however, in spite of the utmost effort, the rich do not become guardians
of the poor in the true sense of the term and the latter are more and more
crushed and die of hunger, what is to be done? In trying to find the solution
to this riddle I have lighted on non-violent non-co-operation and civil
disobedience as the right and infallible means. The rich cannot accumulate
wealth without the co-operation of the poor in society.</P>

<P>On our release from prison, we took up the question where we had left
it in the Aga Khan Palace Detention Camp. Kishorlalbhai and Naraharibhai
joined in drawing up a sample, practical trusteeship formula. It was placed
before Bapu who made a few changes in it. The final draft read as follows:</P>

<CENTER><TABLE CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0" >
<TR>
<TD><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Trusteeship provides a means of transforming
the present capitalist order of society into an egalitarian one. It gives
no quarter to capitalism, but gives the present owing class a chance of
reforming itself. It is based on the faith that human nature is never beyond
redemption.</FONT></B>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">It does not recognize any right of private
ownership of property except so far as it may be permitted by society for
its own welfare.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">It does not exclude legislative regulation
of the ownership and use of wealth.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Thus under State-regulated trusteeship, an
individual will not be free to hold or use his wealth for selfish satisfaction
or in disregard of the interests of society.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Just as it is proposed to fix a decent minimum
living wage, even so a limit should be fixed for the maximum income that
would be allowed to any person in society. The difference between such
minimum and maximum incomes should be reasonable and equitable and variable
from time to time so much so that the tendency would be towards obliteration
of the difference.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Under the Gandhian economic order the character
of production will be determined by social necessity and not by personal
whim or greed.</FONT></B></P>
