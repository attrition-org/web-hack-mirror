<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>I
have drawn the distinction between passive resistance as understood and
practised in the West and <I>satyagraha</I> before I had evolved the doctrine
of the latter to its full logical and spiritual extent. I often used 'passive
resistance' and '<I>satyagraha</I>' as synonymous terms: but as the doctrine
of <I>satyagraha</I> developed, the expression 'passive resistance' ceases
even to be synonymous, as passive resistance has admitted of violence as
in the case of suffragettes and has been universally acknowledged to be
a weapon of the weak. Moreover passive resistance does not necessarily
involve complete adherence to truth under every circumstance. Therefore
it is different from <I>satyagraha</I> in three essentials: <I>Satyagraha</I>
is a weapon of the strong; it admits of no violence under any circumstance
whatever; and it ever insists upon truth. I think I have now made the distinction
perfectly clear. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From a letter, 25.1.1920)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>In the application of <I>Satyagraha</I>, I discovered, in the earliest
stages, that pursuit of Truth did not admit of violence being inflicted
on one's opponent, but that he must be weaned from error by patience and
sympathy. For, what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error
to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to
mean vindication of Truth, not by infliction of suffering on the opponent
but one's own self.</P>

<P><I>Satyagraha </I>and its off-shoots, non-co-operation and civil resistance,
are nothing but new names for the law of suffering.</P>

<P>With <I>satya</I> combined with <I>ahimsa</I>, you can bring the world
to your feet. <I>Satyagraha </I>in its essence is nothing but the introduction
of truth and gentleness in the political, i.e., the national life.</P>

<P><I>Satyagraha </I>is utter self-effacement, greatest humiliation, greatest
patience and brightest faith. It is its own reward.</P>

<P><I>Satyagraha </I>is a relentless search for truth and a determination
to reach truth.</P>

<P>It is a force that works silently and apparently slowly. In reality,
there is no force in the world that is so direct or so swift in working.</P>

<P><I>Satyagraha</I> literally means insistence on truth. This insistence
arms the votary with matchless power. This power or force is connoted by
the word <I>satyagraha</I>. <I>Satyagraha</I>, to be genuine, may be offered
against parents, against one's wife or one's children, against rulers,
against fellow-citizens, even against the whole world.</P>

<P>Such a universal force necessarily makes no distinction between kinsmen
and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe. The force
to be so applied can never be physical. There is in it no room for violence.
The only force of universal aplication can, therefore, be that of <I>ahimsa
</I>or love. In other words, it is soul-force.</P>

<P>Love does not burn others, it burns itself. Therefore, a <I>satyagrahi</I>,
i.e., a civil resister, will joyfully suffer even unto death.</P>

<P>It follows, therefore, that a civil resister, whilst he will strain
every nerve to compass the end of the existing rule, will do no intentional
injury in thought, word or deed to the person of a single Englishman. This
necessarily brief explanation of <I>satyagraha</I> will perhaps enable
the reader to understand and appreciate the following rules:</P>

<P>As an individual:</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>I. A <I>satyagrahi</I>, i.e.,
a civil resister, will harbour no anger.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. He will suffer the anger of
the opponent.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>3. In so doing he will put up
with assaults from the opponent, never retaliate; but he will not submit,
out of fear of punishment or the like, to any order given in in anger.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>4. When any person in authority
seeks to arrest a civil resister, he will voluntarily submit to the arrest,
and he will not resist the attachment or removal of his own property, if
any, when it is sought to be confiscated by authorities.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>5. If a civil resister has any
property in his possession as a trustee, he will refuse to surrender it,
even though in defending it he might lose his life. He will, however, never
retaliate.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>6. Non-retaliation excludes swearing
and cursing.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>7. Therefore a civil resister
wil never insult his opponent, and therefore also not take part in many
of the newly coined cries which are contrary to the spirit of <I>ahimsa</I>.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>8. A civil resister will not
salute the Union Jack, nor will he insult it or officials, English or Indian.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>9. In the course of the struggle
if anyone insults an official or commits an assault upon him, a civil resister
will protect such official or officials from the insult or attack even
at the risk of his life.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 27.2.1930)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The movement of non-violent non-co-operation has nothing in common with
the historical struggles for freedom in the West. It is not based on brute
force or hatred. It does not aim at destroying the tyrant. It is a movement
of self-purification. it therefore seeks to convert the tyrant. It may
fail because India was not ready for mass non-violence. But it would be
wrong to judge the movement by false standards. My own opinion is that
the movement has in no ways failed. It has found an abiding place in India's
struggle for freedom.</P>

<P>Although non-co-operation is one of the main weapons in the armoury
of <I>Satyagraha</I>, it should not be forgotten that it is after all only
a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth
and justice. The essence of non-violent technique is that it seeks to liquidate
antagonisms but not the antagonists themselves. In non-violent fight you
have, to a certain measures, to conform to the tradition and conventions
of the system you are pitted against. Avoidance of all relationship with
the opposing power, therefore, can never be a <I>Satyagrahi</I>'s object
but transformation or purification of that relationship.</P>

<P>Civil disobedience is the inherent right of a citizen. He dare not give
it up without ceasing to be a man. Civil disobedience is never followed
by anarchy. Criminal disobedience can lead to it. Every state puts down
criminal disobedience by force. It perishes if it does not.</P>

<P>A <I>Satyagrahi </I>obeys the laws of society intelligently and of his
own free will, because he considers it to be his sacred duty to do so.
It is only when a person has thus obeyed the laws of society scrupulously
that he is in a position to judge as to which particular laws are good
and just and which unjust and iniquitous. Only then does the right accrue
to him of civil disobedience of certain laws in well-defined circumstances.</P>

<P>Fasting is a potent weapon in the <I>Satyagraha </I>armoury. It cannot
be taken by every one. Mere physical capacity to take it is no qualification
for it. It is of no use without a living faith in God. It should never
be a mechanical effort or a mere imitation. It must come from the depth
of one's soul. It is, therefore, always rare.</P>

<P>I believe that every man and woman should learn the art of self-defence
in this age. This is done through arms in the West. Every adult man is
conscripted for army training for a definite period. The training for <I>Satyagraha
</I>is meant for all, irrespective of age or sex. The more important part
of the training here is mental, not physical. There can be no compulsion
in mental training.</P>
