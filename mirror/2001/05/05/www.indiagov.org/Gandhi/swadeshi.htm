<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>The
idea of <I>swadeshi</I> is of great importance and the progress of the
country in <I>dharma </I>is bound up with it. A country which has forsaken
<I>swadeshi </I>can be said to have no patriotic sentiment and will never
be able to follow its <I>dharma</I>. We do not find this said in our <I>shashtras</I>;
on the contrary, it is even deduced from them that patriotism may be an
obstacle on the path of <I>dharma</I>. This is an utterly absurd and misleading
idea. Everyone ought to be mindful of his duty and failure to do so is
to reduce the path of <I>karma </I>to sheer confusion. In Jainism, the
secret of this path is explained with much greater insight than in any
other faith. The friends who have assembled here do not need to be told
what it is. If a man is born in India, there must be some reason behind
the fact; that being so, we need do consider what is our especial duty.
That duty is <I>swadeshi </I>and is included in <I>dharma</I>. Jainism
teaches compassion towards living creatures and the duty of non-violence;
it even teaches the protection of violent animals against small creatures,
This, however is no justification for our neglecting the duty of compassion
and non-violence towards human beings. If our neighbours are in pain or
misfortune, it is our duty to share their suffering and help them. All
over the world, the religious life has lost importance to such an extent
that ir-religion is spreading in the name of religion and men everywhere
are deceiving themselves. We claim to be men of <I>dharma</I>, whereas
all our actions are tainted with <I>adharma</I>. We cannot claim to have
followed <I>dharma </I>by earning money through <I>adharma</I>, and giving
it in charity for promoting pious causes. Most of the people assembled
here are traders by profession. We are told that trade cannot be carried
on without some admixture of dishonesty. I shall be plain and tell you
that, if that is so, you had better give up trade. One's <I>dharma </I>lies
in refusing to forsake truth even if that means starving, and, unless we
live in this manner, <I>dharma </I>will not be the central purpose of our
lives. </P>

<P>There is a painful thing I am obliged to mention, and it is that our
religious leaders, whose duty it is to enlighten people, have forgotten
that duty. This is true, however much it may hurt us. Religious leaders
have it in them to set an example to their followers by their conduct.
Mere preaching will have no effect on those who assemble to listen to their
discourses. Religious leaders, too, should follow the rule of <I>swadeshi</I>.
They have plenty of time on hand. They should take to the spinning-wheel
and spin and thus set an example to their followers. More than in the repetition
of Rama as they tell the beads, in the music of the spinning-wheel will
they hear the voice of the <I>atman </I>with a beauty all its own. </P>

<P><I>Swadeshi </I>is our primary obligation because it is natural to us.
We have forsaken this natural obligation. Because of its neglect of <I>swadeshi</I>,
the nation has been ruined. Three crores in India, that is, a tenth of
the total population of the country, get only one meal a day, just plain
bread and no more. Crores of rupees are annually lost to foreign countries.
If this wealth of crores could remain in the country, we would be able
to save our starving countrymen. Thus, our economic well-being is also
bound up with <I>swadeshi</I>, and in its observance there lies compassion
for living beings. Moreover, <I>swadeshi </I>cloth is likely to be cheaper
than English cloth. I submit to you that you should make your own cloth
or get it made. The vow of <I>swadeshi </I>is not a difficult one to keep.
Through it we shall remove the hardships of our countrymen. If we work
at the spinning-wheel for eight hours, we can spin one pound of yarn. The
cloth being produced in India today can meet the needs of only 25 per cent
of the population; we should therefore produce enough to meet the needs
of the remaining 75 per cent. If thus people take to turning the spinning-wheel,
not only shall we succeed in keeping the vow of <I>swadeshi </I>but we
shall also ensure production of cloth in plenty. </P>
