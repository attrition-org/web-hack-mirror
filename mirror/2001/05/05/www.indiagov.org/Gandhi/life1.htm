<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#804000">Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi</FONT> </B>was born at Porbandar in Western India on
October 2, 1869. The grandfather and father of Mohandas were famous for
their upright character. His father had little formal education, but his
knowledge and experience had made him a good administrator. His mother,
Putlibai, was deeply religious, widely respected for her wisdom and good
sense. Mohandas was the youngest of six children. He adored his mother.
He loved his father too, but was a little afraid of him. He was seven years
old when his father left Porbandar to become the Dewan of Rajkot. At Rajkot
he was sent to a primary school. By nature he was shy and avoided company.
He received good certificates from his teacher and got scholarship twice.
He was married to Kasturbai at the early age of thirteen. They were about
the same age. Kasturbai was a pretty and lively girl. Since Kasturbai had
no formal education, Gandhiji tried to teach her but she could never concentrate
on books, though she was quick to learn the household work. One day Gandhiji
met Sheik Mehtab, a friend of his elder brother. Sheik had a bad reputation.
Sheik was a meat-eater and he often told Gandhiji that if he ate meat he
would also grow strong like him. Gandhiji had also taken to smoking with
Sheik, his brother, and another relative. He had to pilfer small amounts
of money with which to buy cigarettes. One day, in order to pay off a debt
which his brother had incurred, Gandhiji stole a piece of gold. He knew
that he had committed a great crime. He resolved never in his life to steal
again. He made a clean confession of all this to his ailing father. His
father tore up the paper without saying a word and sank back on his bed
with a sigh. Gandhiji left the room, tears streaming down his face. From
that day, Mohandas loved his father ever more. </P>

<P>After passing his high school examination, Gandhiji joined the College
at Bhavnagar. As he did not find the classes interesting, he returned home
after the first term. His eldest brother and a family friend suggested
to his mother that Mohandas should go to England to study Law. But his
mother, holding orthodox views, was reluctant. There was also the problem
of money. Gandhiji pleaded with her to allow him to go, and he took a vow
not to eat meat, not to drink, and not to touch a woman. Putlibai at last
gave in and on Sept. 4, 1888, Gandhiji left for England. In London young
Gandhi found everything strange. He almost starved until he discovered
a vegetarian restaurant. Struggling to learn western manners and customs,
he bought well-tailored clothes and a top hat. He took lessons in dancing.
He tried his hand at playing the violin. He took lessons in French and
elocution. His attempt to be an Englishman lasted about three months. Then
he gave up the idea. It was during this period that he read Bhagvad Gita.
He read the Bible also. His meals were simple. He avoided expenditure on
transport and went on foot everywhere in London. He started to keep an
account of every penny he spent. He joined the London Vegetarian Society
and soon found himself in its executive council. He wrote articles for
the magazine 'Vegetarian'. The bar examination did not require much study.
He therefore decided to appear for, and passed' the London matriculation
examination. He was called to the Bar on June 10, 1891, and was admitted
as a barrister. On June 12, he sailed for India. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>GOES TO SOUTH AFRICA</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>On reaching India, Gandhiji was shocked to hear the news of his mother's
death. His mother had meant so much to him. At Rajkot, he set up practice
as a barrister. Soon, however, he was disgusted with the greed and pettiness
that he found among the lawyers. It was then that an offer came to him
to go to South Africa on behalf of Dada, Abdulla &amp; Co. who had filed
a suit against another firm for four hundred thousand pounds. His services
were required for one year and the company promised to pay him a fee and
the first-class fare. He readily accepted the offer. It was painful for
him to be parted from Kasturbai again so soon. In April 1893 he left Bombay
for South Africa. Within a week of his arrival in Durban, he visited the
court with Abdulla Seth of Dada, Abdulla &amp; Co. The magistrate asked
Gandhiji to take off his turban which he refused to do and left the court.
He wrote to the Durban press to protest against such insulting rules. His
letter received unexpected publicity. However, some papers called Gandhi
an 'unwelcome' visitor. He left for Pretoria by train, with a first-class
ticket to attend to the case for which he had been engaged. At the next
stop an Englishman entered the compartment, and wanted Gandhiji to vacate
it for him. When he refused to do so, the white man sought the help of
the police and got him removed from the compartment with baggage at Pieter
Maritzburg Railway Station. The train steamed away leaving him on the platform.
He spent the night shivering in the dark waiting-room. Gandhiji took this
experience to heart and resolved that, whatever the cost might be, he would
fight all such injustice. After reaching Pretoria he began his study of
the law suit. Even while he was engaged on it, he found time to call a
meeting of the Indians in Pretoria. It was the first time he had addressed
a meeting. After studying the Dada, Abdulla &amp; Co. suit he was convinced
that his clients' claim was just. He knew, however, that in the court it
would drag on for a long time. So he called together representatives of
both parties. 'Why don't you choose a good man, whom you both trust, to
arbitrate between you?' he said. The representatives were astonished at
this new idea and agreed to his suggestion. An arbitrator was appointed,
and he gave his award in favour of Gandhiji's clients. Although they had
won, Gandhiji persuaded his clients to be lenient with their opponent.
Both parties were happy over the settlement. Now that the Abdulla case
had been settled, there was no need for him to stay on in South Africa.
It was at the farewell party when somebody put a copy of 'Natal Mercury'
in his hands. It revealed to him that the Natal Government was contemplating
introducing a Bill to disfranchise Indians. He was persuaded to drop the
idea of returning to India and drew up a petition to the Natal Assembly.
The petition was presented to the South African Legislature, meetings were
held and funds were collected. Though this agitation failed to defeat the
Bill, it created a profound impression. Gandhiji saw that, if the grievances
of the people were to be redressed, a permanent organisation was necessary.
The Indians there accepted the suggestion and the Natal Indian Congress
was formed in 1894. The new organisation worked under the guidance of Gandhiji.
It focused on the grievances of Indians there and put a new life into them.
He became one of the busiest lawyers in Durban; but his main interest was
his public work. He was now a well-known figure. In 1896 he sailed for
India to bring his wife and children to South Africa. Besides, a visit
to India would be useful in gaining support for the Indians in South Africa.

<P>It was a happy reunion with Kasturbai and their two sons. He launched
a campaign to acquaint the people of India with the condition of the Indians
in South Africa. He met the editors of influential newspapers and important
leaders, including Lokamanya B. G. Tilak and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Many
newspapers published his views and strongly supported his case. Summaries
of these newspaper reports reached South Africa before he returned there.
In less than three months Gandhiji received a cable from Natal asking him
to return. He immediately started with his wife and children. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>SECOND VISIT TO SOUTH
AFRICA</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>There was a great opposition to his re-entry in South Africa. He was
accused of having excited anti-European sentiment in India. A message reached
Gandhiji advising him not to land with the others' there was an angry mob
of the whites at the dock. Kasturbai and the children were sent earlier.
Later, accompanied by Mr. Laughton, the legal adviser of Dada, Abdulla
&amp; Co., he went ashore. As they proceeded, the crowd began to swell.
Suddenly Laughton was pushed aside and the mob set upon Gandhiji. Someone
snatched away his turban, others kicked him until the frail figure collapsed.
Providentially, the wife of the Superintendent of Police saw all this.
She came up and held her parasol between Gandhiji and the crowd. Soon the
police arrived and the crowd was dispersed. The Secretary of State for
the Colonies cabled the Natal Government from London to prosecute the assailants.
The Natal Government expressed their regret to Gandhiji for the incident
and assured him that the assailants would be punished. He thanked them
but he refused to accept the suggestion for prosecution. He told them:
'I do not hold the assailants to blame. They were misled by false reports
about me and I am sure that when the truth becomes known they will be sorry
for their conduct.' The Durban incident raised Gandhjii's prestige and
won more sympathy for the Indians in As the struggle in South Africa continued,
Gandhiji became more and more involved in public activities and his way
of life became simpler. He started cutting down his expenses. He took to
washing and ironing his own clothes and cutting his hair himself. He made
many experiments with his diet. He came to the conclusion that fasting
increased one's will power. While he was thus experimenting with himself,
the Boer war broke out. The Boers were fighting the British. Gandhiji did
not want to support either of them, but his loyalty as a British citizen
made him organize an Indian ambulance corps to help them. The British won
the war. The newspapers in England praised the services rendered by the
Indians. It was now 1901. He felt that his future activity lay not in South
Africa but in India. When he announced his decision to his co-workers,
they agreed to let him go, but only on condition that he would come back
to South Africa if the Indians there needed his help. There were farewell
meetings and presentations of gifts. He wanted to give them back but was
not allowed to do so. He then prepared a trust deed, and all the gifts
were deposited with a bank to be used for the welfare of the Indian community.

INDIA</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>On his arrival in India, Gandhiji went on a tour of the country. He
attended the annual meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta.
He met Congress leaders like Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, Lokamanya B.G. Tilak,
G. K.Gokhale, and others. He was not impressed with the way the Congress
was functioning. He noticed a lack of unity among the delegates. While
they spoke English and affected the style of westerners in their dress,
they did not bother about essential things like sanitation in the camp.
On his own he quietly started cleaning the bathrooms and latrines. 'Why
do you undertake an untouchable's job?' they asked. 'Because the caste
people have made this an untouchable place,' replied Gandhiji. From Calcutta,
Gandhiji travelled around India by train. He was shocked to see the life
of the common people-the famished, ignorant, and neglected masses. In December
1902, a cable reached him from South Africa requesting him to return. The
Colonial Secretary, was arriving from London on a visit to Natal and the
Transvaal, and the Natal Indian Congress wanted Gandhiji to present their
case to him. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>STRUGGLE IN SOUTH AFRICA
</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>Gandhiji reached Natal to lead the Indian deputation but the Colonial
Secretary gave the deputation a cold reception. Before the Boer war, Indians
had been free to enter Transvaal, but now they had to obtain a permit from
the newly created Asiatic Department. To get a permit was no easy matter.
Gandhiji now decided to stay in Transvaal and fight the colour bar there.
He was enrolled in the Supreme Court at Johannesburg. He made good earnings
from his practice, but his heart was in the service of the people. Meanwhile,
he gave up luxuries and pleasures. In 1904, the journal Indian Opinion
was launched by him. He helped the journal generously from his own earnings,
organized the work and wrote the editorial column. The journal, published
every week in Gujarati and English, reflected his ideals and pointed out
to the Indian readers their, duties, rights, failings and prejudices, and
to the Europeans a correct picture of the difficulties faced by the Indians.
Gandhiji met H. S. L. Polak, in 1904, then a sub-editor of the 'Critic'.
The two soon became fast friends. Polak presented to Gandhiji a copy of
a book by John Ruskin called 'Unto This Last'. It influenced Gandhiji a
great deal and he paraphrased it in Gujarati under the title 'SARVODYA'
(Welfare of all). He then hit upon the idea of founding a community with
a true sense of brotherhood. About a hundred acres of land were acquired
at Phoenix near Durban, and a farm was set up. In the beginning six families
were settled there. Indian Opinion was moved to Phoenix. He also pursued
his experiments with diet. 'I intend to be the ruler of my body,' he would
say. In 1906, the Zulu 'Rebellion' broke out in Natal. It was a no-tax
campaign. Gandhiji's sympathies were with the Zulus, but he considered
it his duty to help the British. His offer to form an Indian Ambulance
Corps was accepted. It was in active service for six weeks, nursing and
looking after the wounded. In August 1906 an ordinance was issued by the
Transvaal Government requiring all Indians to register themselves and obtain
a certificate bearing the name and thumb impression. Anyone failing to
produce the certificate was liable to be fined, imprisoned, or deported.
Gandhiji told his co-workers. 'If we meekly submit, it will spell absolute
ruin for us in South Africa.' He saw here the need for passive resistance
or 'satyagraha'. He explained to the people his concept of satyagraha.
He said, they must be prepared to observe absolute non-violence. The authorities
would take all measures to put down the agitation.They might use violence
and send them to jail. 'Merely disobeying the Government's laws will not
be enough,' Gandhiji said. 'You must have no hatred in your hearts. And
you must cast away all fear.' Hundreds of Indians were arrested, and imprisoned.
They all pleaded guilty and went to jail Gandhiji too was imprisoned. Then
one day he was sent to Pretoria to see General Smuts. Smuts said, 'It is
not in me to dislike Indians, but they must obey the law.'' l would rather
die than submit to this law,' Gandhiji replied. 'It is meant to humiliate
the Indians.' Gandhiji promised to end the satyagraha if the 'Black Act'
was repealed and the prisoners released. Smuts agreed to do this provided
the Indians would register of their own accord. On this agreement, they
parted. Back in Johannesburg, Gandhiji called a meeting of the Indians.
'We must now register voluntarily to show that we do not intend to bring
a single Indian to the Transvaal by fraud,' he said. Many Indians followed
Gandhiji by registering voluntarily. But General Smuts did not repeal the
&quot;Black Act&quot;. Gandhiji started another satyagraha movement. More
than two thousand certificates were burnt. Many Indians openly crossed
the border into the Transvaal, where their presence was illegal. Gandhiji
and many of his compatriots were imprisoned several times in the course
of the agitation. When Gandhiji came out of jail for the third time, the
Indians decided to send a deputation to England to acquaint the British
Government with the situation in South Africa. Gandhiji and Seth Haji Habib
were sent to but the mission was a failure. Gandhiji then gave up his practice
as a lawyer. Hermann Kallenbach, a white farmer, offered Gandhiji his own
big farm near Johannesburg to start another colony. He suggested that all
those who had lost their jobs and homes by their participation in the satyagraha
could be settled there. The new colony was established in 1910 and named
'Tolstoy Farm,'. Here people who were different in nationality, religion,
and colour lived together like one family. Meanwhile, the struggle continued
against the &quot;Black Act&quot; and the poll-tax. And now hundreds of
Indian women, including Kasturbai, joined the movement. The arrests, the
deportation of passive-resisters, and the sufferings of Indian families
angered the people of India. Gandhiji, took a triple vow of self-suffering:
to dress like a labourer, to walk bare-foot, and to have only one meal
a day, till the poll-tax and other injustices were abolished. In October
1913, Gandhiji organised a march of over 6,000 Indian workers from the
Natal mining area into the Transvaal. Gandhiji and many other Indians were
imprisoned. The mines were converted into temporary jails. The satyagrahis
were flogged to force them to go back to work, but without success. Gandhiji
had aroused in them the spirit of quiet, dignified resistance. Soon the
movement spread all through Natal and the Transvaal. The prisons were overflowing.
At last General Smuts was obliged to act and appointed a commission. In
December 1913 Gandhiji was released, but he would not give up the struggle.
However, the European employees of the railways in the Union went on strike,
and, therefore Gandhiji decided to drop the idea of the march as he did
not wish to embarrass the Government further. His decision created a good
impression on even General Smuts. The Inquiry Commission reported in favour
of all the essential reforms demanded by the Indian leaders. The Indians'
Relief Bill was passed. It abolished the poll-tax on indentured workers,
declared absolutely legal all Indian marriages, and removed penalties for
crossing from one State to another. Gandhiji had won. And so had the satyagraha
movement. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>BACK TO INDIA </FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>Gandhiji now felt that his mission in South Africa was over. Gandhiji,
with Kasturbai and Kallenbach, sailed for England. On August 4, two days
before he reached London, the First World War was declared. A meeting was
called of the Indians in England. Gandhiji expressed the view that Indians
residing in England ought to do their bit in the war. He felt that England's
difficulty should not be turned into India's opportunity. He also organised
an ambulance corps. Gandhiji was back in India after twelve long years.
A great reception awaited him in Bombay. Gokhale was in Poona and was in
poor health, so Gandhiji went to see him. He told Gokhale that his plan
was to have an ashram where he could settle down with his Phoenix family.
They were already at Santiniketan. Gandhiji went to Rajkot and Porbandar
and then to Santiniketan. The teachers and students there gave him a loving
welcome. There he met Tagore for the first time, and also C. F. Andrews.
On hearing the sad news that Gokhale had passed away, he left for Poona,
C. F. Andrews accompanying him as far as Burdwan. 'Do you think', Andrews
asked Gandhiji, 'that a time will come for satyagraha in India? If so,
how soon will it be?' Gandhiji replied, 'Gokhale made me promise that I
would travel in India for one year to gain experience, and that I would
express no opinion until I had finished this period of probation. So I
do not think there will be any occasion for satyagraha for five years.'
In May 1915 Gandhiji established Satyagraha Ashram near Ahmedabad. The
ashramites took food together in a common kitchen and strove to live as
one family. He told the members: 'If you want to serve the people, it is
essential to observe the vows of truth, ahimsa, celibacy, non-stealing,
non-possession, and control of the palate.' In February 1916, Gandhiji
was invited to speak at the laying of the foundation-stone of the Banaras
Hindu University. The Viceroy and many of the most important people of
India were there. Gandhiji's speech contained outspoken criticism of the
rich in a poor country like India. 'Here at last is a man telling the truth',
many thought. 'He is the man to raise India from the mire.' For two years
Gandhiji had travelled extensively. His first interest centred on the problem
of indenturned labour. He had fought this system in South Africa. He wanted
a definite date before which the system would go. He consulted all the
Indian leaders. As a result of the agitation, the Government announced
that the system of indentured labour would be stopped before July 31, 1917.

</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>In Champaran district of Bihar, the cultivators were forced by Europeans
to grow indigo and this imposed on them untold sufferings. An agriculturist
from Bihar, Rajkomar Shukla, requested Gandhiji to go to the place and
see for himself the state of affairs there. Gandhiji went to Champaran
early in 1917. On his arrival the District Magistrate served him with a
notice saying that he must leave the place by the first train. The magistrate
said, 'If you leave the district now and promise not return, the case against
you will be withdrawn.' 'This cannot be,' replied Gandhiji. 'I came here
to render humanitarian and national service. A large crowd of peasants
was outside the court shouting slogans. Gandhiji appeared before the crowd
and said, 'Any violent act will harm our cause.' The crowd dipersed peacefully.
The Government withdrew the case against Gandhiji and he stayed there to
study the grievances of the peasants. He cross-examined about 8,000 cultivators
and recorded their statements. He came to the conclusion that the ignorance
of the cultivators was one of the main reasons why it was possible for
the European planters to repress them. Gandhiji therefore set up voluntary
organisations to improve the economic and educational conditions of the
people. They opened schools and also taught the people how to improve sanitation.
The Government then set up a committee to enquire into the grievances of
the cultivators and invited Gandhiji to serve on it. The result was that
within a few months the Champaran Agrarian Bill was passed. It gave great
relief to the cultivators and land-tenants. While Gandhiji was in Champaran,
a labour dispute started in the textile mills at Ahmedabad. Prices had
gone up and the mill workers were demanding higher wages. The mill owners
would not agree with the full demand. Gandhiji sympathised with the workers
and took up their cause. Under him peaceful struggle was launched and the
workers went on strike. Days passed. The strikers were getting impatient.
Gandhiji feared that some workers would break their pledge and go back
to work. One morning he called the workers and said, 'Unless the strikers
rally and continue the strike till a settlement is reached....! will not
touch any food.' His fast was not against mill owners, but against the
lack of co-ordination and unity among workers. It lasted only for three
days. It influenced the mill owners so much that they came to an agreement
with the workers. The Kheda district of Gujarat was on the verge of famine
owing to failure of the crops. The yield had been so low that the cultivators,
especially the poorer section, were unable to pay the revenue. But the
Government insisted that the cultivators should pay the tax. Gandhiji saw
the justice of the cause of the cultivators and advised them to offer satyagraha
by not paying their taxes. Many leaders, like Vallabhbhai Patel, Shankarlal
Banker, Mahadev Desai and others, took an active part in this struggle.
After four months' struggle there came an honourable settlement.</P>
