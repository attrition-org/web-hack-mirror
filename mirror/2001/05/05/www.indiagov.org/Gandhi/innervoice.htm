<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>There
come to us moments in life when about some things we need no proof from
without. A little voice within us tells us, 'You are on the right track,
move neither to your left nor right, but keep to the straight and narrow
way.' </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(The Leader, 25.12.1916</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I am but a poor struggling soul yearning to be wholly good - wholly
truthful and wholly non-violent in thought, word and deed, but ever failing
to reach the ideal which I know to be true. I admit it is a painful climb,
but the pain of it is a positive pleasure for me. Each step upward makes
me feel stronger and fit for the next. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 9.4.1924</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I know the path. It is straight and narrow. It is like the edge of a
sword. I rejoice to walk on it. I weep when I slip. God's word is: 'He
who strives never perishes.' I have implicit faith in that promise. Though,
therefore, from my weakness I fail a thousand times, I will not lose faith,
but hope that I shall see the Light when the flesh has been brought under
perfect subjection, as some day it must. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 17.6.1926</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>For me the Voice of God, of Conscience, of Truth, or the Inner Voice
or 'the Still Small Voice' mean one and the same thing. I saw no form.
I have never tried, for I have always believed God to be without form.
But what I did hear was like a Voice from afar and yet quite near. It was
as unmistakable as some human voice definitely speaking to me, and irresistible.
I was not dreaming at the time I heard the Voice. The hearing of the Voice
was preceded by a terrific struggle within me. Suddenly the Voice came
upon me. I listened, made certain it was the Voice, and the struggle ceased.
I was calm. The determination was made accordingly, the date and the hour
of the fast were fixed.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 8.7.1933</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>My experience tells me that, instead of bothering about how the whole
world may live in the right manner, we should think how we ourselves may
do so. We do not even know whether the world lives in the right manner
of in a wrong manner. If, however, we live in the right manner, we shall
feel that others also do the same, or shall discover a way of persuading
them to do so. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From a letter to Bablabhai, S.N. 9449, 4.8.1932</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I am firmly of the view, and it is my experience too, that, if a person
has violated a moral principle in any one sphere of his life, his action
will certainly have an effect in other spheres. In other words, the belief
generally held that an immoral man may do no harm in the political sphere
is quite wrong. And so is the other belief that a person who violates moral
principles in his business may be moral in his private life or in his conduct
in family affairs. Hence, whenever we do an evil we should overcome the
tendency towards it. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From a letter to Parasuram Mehrotra; CW9437, 22.4.1932</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>All of us are far away from our ideal and will remain so. Our duty lies
in striving to reach it. Man's ideal grows from day to day and that is
why it ever recedes from him. You are ever striving and that is all that
you can do. Our effort should be pure and unremitting. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From a Letter to Gangabehu Vaidya, CW8751, 30.6.1930</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>A vow has the effect of raising us exactly because, in spite of it,
there is a chance of our falling. If there was no such danger, there would
be no scope for striving. A vow serves the same purpose as a light house
does. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Navajivan, 1.8.1926</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Taking vows is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. To do at any
cost something that one ought to do constitutes a vow. It becomes a bulwark
of strength. A man who says that he will do something 'as far as possible'
betrays either his pride or his weakness. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Yeravda Mandir, Ashram Observances</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Our scriptures have laid down certain rules as maxims of life and as
axioms which we have to take for granted as self-demonstrated truths. Believing
in these implicitly for all these long years and having actually endeavoured
to reduce to practice these injunctions. The rules that have been drawn
up and that have to be observed by every one who seeks to be a member of
that Ashram [are as follows]: </P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of<A HREF="../Gandhi1/truth&god.htm"> Truth</A></B><A HREF="../Gandhi1/truth&god.htm">
</A></P></CENTER>

<P>Not truth simply as we ordinarily understand it, not truth which merely
answers the saying, 'Honesty is the best policy,' implying that, if it
is not the best policy, we may depart from it. But here Truth as it is
conceived means that we have to rule our life by this law of Truth at any
cost; </P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of<I><A HREF="ahimsa.htm"> Ahimsa</A></I></B><I><A HREF="ahimsa.htm">
</A></I></P></CENTER>

<P>Ahimsa really means that you may not offend anybody; you may not harbour
an uncharitable thought, even in connection with one who may consider himself
to be your enemy. For one who follows this doctrine there is no room for
an enemy.. But there are people who consider themselves to be his enemies.
So it is held that we may not harbour an evil thought even in connection
with such persons. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of Non-thieving</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>If I take anything that I do not need for my own immediate use and keep
it, I thieve it from somebody else. It is the fundamental law of Nature,
without exception, that Nature, without exception, that Nature produces
enough for our wants from day to day; and if produces enough for our wants
from day to day; and if only everybody took enough for himself and nothing
more, there would be no pauperism in this world, there would be no man
dying of starvation. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of Celibacy</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Those who want to perform national service, or to have a gleam of the
real religious life, must lead a celibate life, whether married or unmarried.
Marriage only brings a woman closer to man, and they become friends in
a special sense, never to be parted either in this life or in the lives
to come. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of Non-possession</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I dare not possess anything which I do not want. In India, we have got
many millions of people who have to be satisfied with one meal a day, and
that meal consisting of a <I>chapati</I> containing no fat in it and a
pinch of salt. You and I have no right to anything that we really have
until these many million are clothed and fed. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Address at YMCA&nbsp;Auditorium, Madras, 1916</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of Body <A HREF="economics.htm">Labour</A></B><A HREF="economics.htm">
</A></P></CENTER>

<P>I cannot imagine anything nobler or more national that for, say, one
hour in the day, we should all do the labour that the poor must do, and
thus identify ourselves with them and through them with all mankind. I
cannot imagine better worship of God than that in His name I should labour
for the poor even as they do. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 20.10.1921</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of the Control of the Palate</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I fear this is one of the most difficult vows to follow. Unless we are
prepared to rid ourselves of stimulating, heating, and exciting condiment
we will certainly not be able to control the over-abundant, unnecessary,
and exciting stimulation of the animal passions. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of Fearlessness</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I suggest to you that there is only One whom we have to fear, that is
God. When we fear God, then we shall fear no man, however high-placed he
may be; and if you want to follow the vow of Truth, then fearlessness is
absolutely necessary. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Address at YMCA auditorium, Madras, 16.2. 1916</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of Religious Tolerance</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Tolerance gives us spiritual insight, which is as far from fanaticism
as the North Pole from the South. True knowledge of religion breaks down
the barriers between faith and faith. Cultivation of tolerance for other
faiths will impart to us a truer understanding of our own </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From Yeravda Mandir; Ashram Observances</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow of<I><A HREF="swadeshi.htm"> Swadeshi</A></I></B>
</P></CENTER>

<P>We are departing from one of the sacred laws of our being when we leave
our neighbourhood and go out somewhere else in order to satisfy our wants.
</P>

<CENTER><P><B>The Vow regarding the 'Untouchables'</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>There is an ineffaceable blot that Hinduism today carries with it. This
evil has stuck to us and still remains with us. It is, to my mind, a curse
that has come to us; and as long as the consider that every affliction
in this sacred land is a proper punishment for the indelible crime that
we are committing. </P>
