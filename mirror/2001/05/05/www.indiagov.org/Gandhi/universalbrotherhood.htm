<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>My
patriotism is not an exclusive thing. It is all-embracing and I should
reject that patriotism which sought to mount upon the distress or the exploitation
of other nationalities. The conception of my patriotism is nothing if it
is not always in every case, without exception, consistent with the broadest
good of humanity at large. Not only that but my religion and my patriotism
derived from my religion embrace all life. </P>

<P>I want to realise brotherhood or identity nor merely with the beings
called human, but I want to realise identity with all life, even with such
beings as crawl on earth. I want, if I don't give you a shock, to realise
identity with even the crawling things upon earth, because we claim common
descent from the same God, and that being so, all life in whatever form
it appears must be essentially one. </P>

<P>Just as the cult of patriotism teaches us today that the individual
has to die for the family, the family has to die for the village, the village
for the district, the district for the province, and the province for the
country, even so a country has to be free in order that it may die, if
necessary, for the benefit of the world. <BR>

<P>Nothing can be farther from my thought than that we should become exclusive
or erect barriers. But I do respectfully contend that an appreciation of
other cultures can fitly follow, never precede, an appreciation and assimilation
of our own. </P>

<P>My religion forbids me to belittle or disregard other cultures, as it
insists under pain of civil suicide upon imbibing and living my own. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 1.9.1921</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>It is impossible for one to be internationalist without being a nationalist.
Internationalism is possible only when nationalism becomes a fact, i.e.,
when peoples belonging to different countries have organised themselves
and are able to act as one man. It is not nationalism that is evil, it
is the narrowness, selfishness, exclusiveness which is the bane of modern
nations which is evil. Each wants to profit at the expense of, and rise
on the ruin of, the other. Indian nationalism has struck a different path.
It wants to organise itself or to find full self-expression for the benefit
and service of humanity at large. God having cast my lot in the midst of
the people of India, I should be untrue to my Maker if I failed to serve
them. If I do not know how to serve them I shall never know how to serve
humanity. And I cannot possibly go wrong so long as I do not harm other
nations in the act of serving my country. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 18.6.1925</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Mankind is one, seeing that all are equally subject to the moral law.
All men are equal in God's eyes. There are, of course, differences of race
and status and the like, but the higher the status of a man, the greater
is his responsibility. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(All men are brothers</FONT></I>, <FONT SIZE=-2>MKG,

<P>I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to
be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house
as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse
to live in other people's houses as an interloper, a beggar or a slave.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 1.6.1921</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Interdependence is and ought to be as much the ideal of man as self-sufficiency.
Man is a social being. Without inter-relation with society, he cannot realise
his oneness with the universe or suppress his egotism. His social interdependence
enables him to test his faith and to prove himself on the touchstone of
reality. If man were so placed or could so place himself as to be absolutely
above all dependence on his fellow-beings, he would become so proud and
arrogant as to be a veritable burden and nuisance to the world. Dependence
on society teaches him the lesson of humanity. And if one may take help
from one's own family, why not from one's neighbours? Or, otherwise, what
is the significance of the great saying, 'The world is my family'. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Young India, 21.3. 1929</FONT></I> </B></P>

<P>The golden rule of conduct is mutual toleration, seeing that we will
never all think alike and we shall always see Truth in fragment and from
different angles of vision. Conscience is not the same thing for all. Whilst,
therefore, it is a good guide for individual conduct, imposition of that
conduct upon all will be an insufferable interference with everybody's
freedom of conscience. Even amongst the most conscientious persons, there
will be room enough for honest differences of opinion. The only possible
rule of conduct in any civilised society is, therefore, mutual toleration.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 22.9.1946</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>What is true of individuals is true of nations. One cannot forgive too
much. The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 21.7.1920</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I reiterate my conviction that there will be no peace for the Allies
or the world unless they shed their belief in the efficacy of war and its
accompanying terrible deception and fraud and are determined to hammer
out real peace based on freedom and equality of all races and nations.
Exploitation and domination of one nation over another can have no place
in a world striving to put an end to all wars. In such a world only, the
militarily weaker nations will be free from the fear of intimidation or
exploitation. </P>

<P>Not to return violence by violence but neutralise it by withholding
one's hand and, at the same time, refusing to submit to the [aggressor's]
demand [backed by force] is the only civilised way of going on in the world.
Any other course can only lead to a race for armaments, interspersed by
periods of peace which is by necessity and brought about by exhaustion,
when preparations will be going on for violence of a superior order. Peace
through superior violence inevitably leads to the atom bomb and all that
it stands for. It is the completest negation of non-violence and of democracy
which is not possible without the former. </P>
