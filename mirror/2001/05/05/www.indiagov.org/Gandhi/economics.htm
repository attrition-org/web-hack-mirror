<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>True
economics never militates against the highest ethical standard, just as
all true ethics to be worth its name must at the same time be also good
economics. An economics that inculcates Mammon worship, and enables the
strong to amass wealth at the expense of the weak, is a false and dismal
science. It spells death. True economics, on the other hand, stands for
social justice, it promotes the good of all equally including the weakest,
and is indispensable for decent life. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 9.10.1937)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>According to me the economic constitution of India and, for that matter
of the world should be such that no one under it should suffer from want
of food and clothing. In other words, everybody should be able to get sufficient
work to enable him to make the two ends meet. </P>

<P>And this ideal can be universally realised only if the means of production
of the elementary necessaries of life remain in the control of the masses.
These should be freely available to all as God's air and water are or ought
to be; they should not be made a vehicle of traffic for the exploitation
of others. This monopolisation by any country, nation or group of persons
would be unjust. The neglect of this simple principle is the cause of destitution
that we witness today not only in this unhappy land but other parts of
the world too. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 15.11.1928</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Economic equality of my conception does not mean that everyone will
literally have the same amount. It simply means that everybody should have
enough for his or her needs. </P>

<P>The real meaning of economic equality is &quot;To each according to
his need.&quot; That is the definition of Marx. If a single man demands
as much as a man with wife and four children, that will be violation of
economic equality. </P>

<P>Let no one try to justify the glaring difference between the classes
and the masses, the prince and the pauper, by saying that the former need
more. That will be idle sophistry and a travesty of my argument. </P>

<P>The contrast between the rich and the poor today is a painful sight.
The poor villagers are exploited by their own countrymen - the city-dwellers.
They produce the food and go hungry. They produce milk and their children
have to go without it. It is disgraceful. </P>

<P>Everyone must have a balanced diet, a decent house to live in, facilities
for the education of one's children and adequate medical relief. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 31.3.1946</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><I><A HREF="swadeshi.htm"><B>Swadeshi</B> </A></I></P></CENTER>

<P><I>Swadeshi </I>is that spirit in us which restricts us to the use and
service of our immediate surroundings to the exclusion of the more remote.
Thus, as for religion, in order to satisfy the requirements of the definition,
I must restrict myself to my ancestral religion. That is, the use of my
immediate religious surrounding. If I find it defective, I should serve
it by purging it of its defects. </P>

<P>In the domain of politics, I should make use of the indigenous institutions
and serve them by curing them of their proved defects. In that of economics,
I should use only things that are produced by my immediate neighbours and
serve those industries by making them efficient and complete where they
might be found wanting. It is suggested that such <I>Swadeshi</I>, if reduced
to practice, will lead to the millennium..... </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Speech, 14.2.1916</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Much of the deep poverty of the masses is due to the ruinous departure
from Swadeshi in the economic and industrial life. If not a single article
of commerce had been brought from outside India, she would be today land
flowing with milk and honey. But that was not to be. We were greedy and
so was England. </P>

<P>If we follow the <I>Swadeshi </I>doctrine, it would be your duty and
mine to find our neighbours who can supply our wants and to teach them
to supply them where they do not know how to proceed, assuming that there
are neighbours who are in want of healthy occupation. Then every village
of India will almost be a self-supporting and self-contained unit, exchanging
only such necessary commodities with other villages as are not locally
produceable. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Speech, 14.2. 1916</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Even <I>Swadeshi</I>, like any other good thing, can be ridden to death
if it is made a fetish. That is a danger that must be guarded against.
To reject foreign manufactures, merely because they are foreign and to
go on wasting national time and money in the promotion in one's country
of manufactures for which it is not suited would be criminal folly and
a negation of the <I>Swadeshi </I>spirit. </P>

<P>A true votary of <I>Swadeshi </I>will never harbour ill-will towards
the foreigner; he will not be actuated by antagonism towards anybody on
earth. <I>Swadeshism </I>is not a cult of hatred. It is a doctrine of selfless
service that has its roots in the purest <I>ahimsa</I>, i.e., love. </P>

<CENTER><P><B>Message of the <I>Charkha</I></B><I> </I></P></CENTER>

<P>I claim for the Charkha the honour of being able to solve the problem
of economic distress in a most natural, simple, inexpensive and businesslike
manner. It is the symbol of the nation's prosperity and, therefore, freedom.
It is a symbol not of commercial war but of commercial peace. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 8.12.1921</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>The message of the spinning-wheel is much wider than its circumference.
Its message is one of simplicity, service of mankind, living so as not
to hurt others, creating an indissoluble bond between the rich and the
poor, capital and labour, the prince and the peasant. That larger message
is naturally for all. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 17.9.1925</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>The message of the spinning-wheel is, really to replace the spirit of
exploitation by the spirit of service. The dominant note in the West is
the note of exploitation. I have no desire that our country should copy
that spirit or that note. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 2.2.1928</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Do I seek to destroy the mill-industry, I have often been asked. If
I did, I should not have pressed for the abolition of the excise duty.
I want the mill-industry to prosper - only I do not want it to prosper
at the expense of the country. On the contrary, if the interests of the
country demand that the industry should go, I should let it go without
the slightest compunction. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 24.2.1927</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>The law, that to live man must work, first came home to me upon reading
Tolstoy's writing on bread labour. In my view, the same principle has been
set forth in the third chapter of the <I>Gita </I>where we are told that
he who eats without offering sacrifice eats stolen food. Sacrifice here
can only mean bread labour. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(From Yervada Mandir</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Every man has an equal right to the necessaries of life even as birds
and beasts have. And since every right carries with it a corresponding
duty and the corresponding remedy for resisting any attack upon it, it
is merely a matter of finding out the corresponding duties and remedies
to vindicate the elementary fundamental equality. The corresponding duty
is to labour with my limbs and the corresponding remedy is to non-co-operate
with him who deprives me of the fruit of my labour. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 26.3.1932</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><B>Division of Labour</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I believe in the division of labour or work. But I do insist on equality
of wages. The lawyer, the doctor or the teacher is entitled to no more
than the <I>bhangi</I>. Then only will division of work uplift the nation
or the earth. There is no other royal road to true civilisation or happiness.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 23.3.1947</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>If everybody lives by the sweat of his brow, the earth will become a
paradise. The question of the use of special talents hardly needs separate
consideration, If everyone labours physically for his bread, it follows
that poets, doctors, lawyers, etc., will regard it their duty to use those
talents gratis for the service of humanity. Their output will be all the
better and richer for their selfless devotion to duty. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 2.3.1947</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>We should be ashamed of resting, or having a square meal, so long as
there is one able-bodied man or woman without work or food. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 6.10.1921)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>It is surely the duty of a Government to ensure bread labour for all
unemployed men and women, no matter how many there are. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 11.1.1948</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<CENTER><P><B>Intellectual Labour</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I do not discount the value of intellectual labour, but no amount of
it is any compensation for bodily labour which everyone of us is born to
give for the common good of all. It may be, often is, infinitely superior
to bodily labour, but it never is or can be a substitute for it, even as
intellectual food, though far superior to the grains we eat, never can
be a substitute for them. Indeed, without the products of the earth, those
of the intellect would be an impossibility. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 15.10.1925</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Exploitation of the poor can be extinguished not by effecting the destruction
of a few millionaires, but by removing the ignorance of the poor and teaching
them to non-co-operate with their exploiters. That will convert the exploiters
also. I have even suggested that ultimately it will lead to both being
equal partners. Capital as such is not evil; it is the wrong use that is
evil. Capital in some form or the other will always be needed. </P>
