<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>I
have been asked by Sir S. Radhakrishnan to answer the following three questions:
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9B0000"><B><FONT SIZE=-1>What is your religion?</FONT></B>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9B0000"><B><FONT SIZE=-1>How are you led to it?</FONT></B>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9B0000"><B><FONT SIZE=-1>What is its bearing on social
life?</FONT></B> </FONT></P>

<P>My religion is Hinduism which, for me, is the religion of humanity and
includes the best of all the religions known to me. </P>

<P>I take it that the present tense in the second question has been purposely
used instead of the past. I am being led to my religion through Truth and
Non-Violence, i.e., love in the broadest sense. I often describe my religion
as religion of Truth. Of late, instead of saying God is Truth I have been
saying <A HREF="../Gandhi1/truth&god.htm">Truth is God</A>, in order more
fully to define my religion. I used at one time to know by heart the thousand
names of God which a booklet in Hinduism gives in verse form and which
perhaps tens of thousands recite every morning. But now-a-days nothing
so completely describes my God as Truth. Denial of God we have known. Denial
of Truth we have not known. The most ignorant among mankind have some truth
in them. We are all sparks of Truth. The sum total of these sparks is indescribable,
as-yet-Unknown Truth, which is God. I am being daily led nearer to it by
constant prayer. </P>

<P>The bearing of this religion on social life is, or has to be, seen in
one's daily social contact. To be true to such religion one has to lose
oneself in continuous and continuing service of all life. Realisation of
Truth is impossible without a complete merging of oneself in and identification
with this limitless ocean of life. Hence, for me, there is no escape from
social service; there is no happiness on earth beyond or apart from it.
Social service here must be taken to include every department of life.
In this scheme there is nothing low, nothing high. For all is one, though
we <I>seem</I> to be many. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>(S. Radhakrishnan, <I>Contemporary Indian Philosophy</I>
p 21, 23.1.1935</FONT>)</B></P>

<P>I have realised that every religion contains both truth and untruth.
The root of all religions is one and it is pure and all of them have sprung
from the same source, hence all are equal. This equality of all religions
has been included by Vinoba among the eleven vows in a Marathi <I>sloka</I>,
which is daily recited in the prayers. </P>

<P>Non-violence, truth, non-stealing, <I>brahmacharya</I>, non-possession,
<A HREF="economics.htm">body-labour</A>, control of the palate, fearlessness
on all occasions, equal respect for all religions, <A HREF="swadeshi.htm"><I>swadeshi</I>
</A>and <I>sparshabhavana</I> - these <A HREF="innervoice.htm">eleven vows</A>
should be observed in a spirit of humility. </P>

<P>I am trying to live in accordance with this and so are my associates.
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>(From a letter to Mahadev Shastri Divekar, Pyarelal
papers, 1.11.1945</FONT>)</B></P>

<P>Indeed, religion should pervade every one of our actions. Here religion
does not mean sectarianism. It means a belief in ordered moral government
of the universe. It is not less real because it is unseen. This religion
transcends Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, etc. It does not supersede them.
It harmonises them and gives them reality. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 10.2.1940</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>For me, politics bereft of religion are absolute dirt, ever to be shunned.
Politics concern nations and that which concerns the welfare of nations
must be one of the concerns of a man who is religiously inclined, in other
words, a seeker after God and Truth. For me, God and Truth are convertible
terms, and if anyone told me that God was a god of untruth or a god of
torture, I would decline to worship Him. Therefore, in politics also we
have to establish the Kingdom of Heaven. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 18.6.1925</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I cannot isolate politics from the deepest things of my life, for the
simple reason that my politics are not corrupt, they are inextricably bound
up with non-violence and truth. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 1.10.1931</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>I could not be leading a religious life unless I identified myself with
the whole of mankind, and that I could not do unless I took part in politics.
The whole gamut of man's activities today constitutes an indivisible whole.
You cannot divide social, economic, political and purely religious work
into watertight compartments. I do not know any religion apart from human
activity. It provides a moral basis to all other activities which they
would otherwise lack, reducing life to a maze of 'sound and fury signifying
nothing'. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 24.12.1938</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>Let no one even for a moment entertain the fear that a reverent study
of other religions is likely to weaken or shake one's faith in one's own.
The Hindu system of philosophy regards all religions as containing the
elements of truth in them and enjoins an attitude of respect and reverence
towards them all. This of course presupposes regard for one's own religion.
Study and appreciation of other religions need not cause a weakening of
that regard; it should mean extension of that regard to other religions.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 6.12.1928</FONT></I>)</B></P>

<P>We must believe in God if we believe in ourselves. If living beings
have existence God is the sum total of all life and this in my view is
the strongest proof. </P>

<P>The denial of God is injurious in the same way as denial of ourselves.
That is to say, to deny God is like committing suicide. The fact remains
that it is one thing to believe in God and quite another to realise God
emotionally and act accordingly. Truly, no one in the world is an atheist;
atheism is merely a pose. </P>

<P>One can realise God only by ridding oneself totally of attachment, aversion,
etc., and in no other way. I hold that one who claims to have realised
God has not truly done so. Realisation can be experienced, but is beyond
description. Of this I have do doubt. </P>

<P>I can live only by having faith in God. My definition of God must always
be kept in mind. For me there is no other God than Truth; Truth is God.

<P>What a joy it would be when people realise that religion consists not
in outward ceremonial but an ever-growing inward response to the highest
impulses that man is capable of. </P>
