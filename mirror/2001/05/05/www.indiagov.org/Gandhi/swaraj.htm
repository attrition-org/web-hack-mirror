<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>My
conception of freedom is no narrow conception. It is co-extensive with
the freedom of man in all his majesty.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 7.6.1942)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The word <I>Swaraj </I>is a sacred word, a Vedic word, meaning self-rule
and self-restraint, and not freedom from all restraint which 'independence'
often means.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 19.3.1931)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>By <I>Swaraj </I>I mean the government of India by the consent of the
people as ascertained by the largest number of the adult population, male
or female, native-born or domiciled, who have contributed by manual labour
to the service of the State and who have taken the trouble of having their
names registered as voters.</P>

<P>Real <I>Swaraj </I>will come, not by the acquisition of authority by
a few, but by the acquisition of the capacity by all to resist authority
when it is abused. In other words, <I>Swaraj </I>is to be attained by educating
the masses to a sense of their capacity to regulate and control authority.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 29.1.1925)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><I>Swaraj </I>for me means freedom for the meanest of our countrymen.
I am not interested in freeing India merely from the English yoke. I am
bent upon freeing India from any yoke whatsoever..</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 12.6.1924)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><I>Swaraj </I>of a people means the sum total of the <I>Swaraj </I>(self-rule)
of individuals. And such <I>Swaraj </I>comes only from performance by individuals
of their duty as citizens. In it no one thinks of his rights. They come,
when they are needed, for better performance of duty.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 25.3.1939)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>I am afraid I must repeat the gospel to you and remind you that, when
you demand <I>Swaraj</I>, you do not want <I>Swaraj </I>for yourself alone,
but for your neighbour, too.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 1.3.1935)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>If <I>Swaraj </I>was not meant to civilise us, and to purify and stabilise
our civilisation, it would be nothing worth. The very essence of our civilisation
is that we give a paramount place to morality in all our affairs, public
or private.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 23.1.1930)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>If we wish to achieve <I>Swaraj </I>through truth and non-violence,
gradual but steady building-up from the bottom upwards by constructive
effort is the only way. This rules out the deliberate creation of an anarchical
state for the ovethrow of the established order in the hope of throwing
up from within a dictator who would rule with a rod of iron and produce
order our of disorder.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 7.4.1946)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Democracy disciplined and enlightened is the finest thing in the world.
A democracy prejudiced, ignorant, superstitious, will land itself in chaos
and may be self-destroyed.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Young India, 30.7.1931)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>I beleive that true democracy can only be an outcome of non-violence.</P>

<P>No perfect democracy is possible without perfect non-violence at the
back of it.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 2.3.1947)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Evolution of democracy is not possible if we are not prepared to hear
the other side. We shut the doors of reason when we refuse to listen to
our opponents or, having listened, make fun of them. If intolerance becomes
a habit, we run the risk of missing the truth. Whilst with the limits that
nature has put upon our understanding, we must act fearlessly according
to the light vouchsafed to us, we must always keep an open mind and be
ever ready to find that what we believed to be truth was, after all, untruth.
This openness of mind strengthens the truth in us and removes the cross
from it if there is any.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 31.5.1942)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>In democracy, the individual will is governed and limited by the social
will which is the State, which is governed by and for democracy. If every
individual takes the law into his own hands, there is no State, it becomes
anarchy, i.e., absence of social law or State. That way lies destruction
of liberty. Therefore, you should subdue your anger and let the State secure
justice.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 28.4.1.947)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>People in a democracy should be satisfied with drawing the Government's
attention to mistakes, if any. They could remove the Government if they
wished to. But they should not obstruct them by agitating against them.
Ours is not a foreign Government having a mighty Army and Navy to support
them. They have to derive their strength from the people.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>(Harijan, 26.10.1947)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>I shall work for an India in which the poorest shall feel that it is
their country, in whose making they have an effective voice; an India in
which there shall be no high class and low class of people; an India in
which all communities shall live in perfect harmony. There can be no room
in such an India for the curse of untouchability, or the curse of the intoxicating
drinks and drugs. Women will enjoy the same rights as men.</P>

<P>Since we shall be at peace with all the rest of the world, neither exploiting,
nor being exploited, we should have the smallest army imaginable. All interests
not in conflict with the interests of the dumb millions will be scrupulously
respected, whether foreign or indigenous. Personally, I hate distinction
between foreign and indigenous. This is the India of my dreams. I shall
be satisfied with nothing else.</P>
