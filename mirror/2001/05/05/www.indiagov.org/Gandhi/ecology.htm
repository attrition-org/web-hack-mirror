<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>The
one thing, which we can and must learn from the West, is the science of
municipal sanitation. The peoples of the West have evolved a science of
corporate sanitation and hygiene from which we have much to learn. We must
modify western methods of sanitation to suit our requirements.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Young India, 26-12-'24</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>If night-soil was properly utilized, we would get manure worth lakhs
of rupees and also secure immunity from a number of diseases. By our bad
habits we spoil our sacred river banks and furnish excellent breeding grounds
for flies, with the result that the very flies which through our criminal
negligence settle upon uncovered night-soil defile our bodies after we
have bathed. A small spade is the means of salvation from a great nuisance.
Leaving night-soil, cleaning the nose, or spitting on the road is a sin
against God as well as humanity, and betrays a sad want of consideration
for others. The man who does not cover his waste deserves a heavy penalty
even if he lives in a forest. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Satyagraha in South Africa</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Giving the willing cooperation of the masses of India, this country
cannot only drive out shortage of food, but can provide India with more
than enough. This organic manure ever enriches, never impoverishes, the
soil. The daily waste judiciously composed, returns to the soil in the
form of golden manure causing a saving of millions of rupees and increasing
manifold, the total yield of grains and pulses. In addition, the judicious
use of waste keeps the surroundings clean. And cleanliness is not only
next to Godliness, it promotes health.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Harijan, 28-12-1947</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The essence of nature cure is that we learn the principles of hygiene
and sanitation and abide by those laws as well as the laws relating to
proper nutrition.</P>

<P>Doctors say that 99% of disease springs from insanitation, from eating
the wrong food and from under-nourishment.</P>

<P>Today pure water, good earth, fresh air, are unknown to us. We do not
know the inestimable value of ether and the sun. If we make use of these
five powers and if we eat the proper and balanced diet, we shall have done
the work of ages. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Harijan, 1-9-1946</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>If rural reconstruction will not include rural sanitation, our villages
would remain the dung-heaps that they are today.</P>

<P>The whole of this programme will, however, be a structure on sand, if
it is not built on solid foundations of economic equality. Economic equality
must never be supposed to mean possession of an equal amount of worldly
goods by everyone. It does mean, however, that everyone will have a proper
house to live, sufficient and balanced food to eat, and sufficient <I>Khadi
</I>with which to cover himself. It also means that the cruel inequality
that obtains today will be removed by purely non-violent means. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Harijan, 18-8-1940</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>We have to tackle the triple malady which holds our villages fast in
its grips: (i) want of corporate sanitation: (ii) deficient diet; (iii)inertia.
They are not interested in their own welfare. They do not appreciate modern
sanitary methods. They do not want to exert themselves beyond scratching
their farms or doing such labour as they are used to. These difficulties
are real and serious. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Young India, 26-11-1919</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>God forbid that India should ever take to industrialism after the manner
of the West. The economic imperialism of a single tiny island kingdom (England)
is today keeping the world in chains. If an entire nation of 300 million
took to similar economic exploitation, it would strip the world bare like
locusts. Unless the capitalists of India help to avert that tragedy by
becoming trustees of the welfare of the masses and by devoting their talents
not to amassing wealth for themselves but to the service of the masses
in an altruistic spirit, they will end either by destroying the masses
or being destroyed by them. </P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Young India, 20-12-1928</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>It is an arrogant assumption to say that human beings are lords and
masters of the lower creatures. On the contrary, being endowed with greater
things in life, they are the trustees of the lower animal kingdom.</P>

<P>Civilization, in the real sense of the term; consists not in the multiplication,but
in the deliberate and voluntary reduction of wants. This alone promotes
real happiness and contentment, and increases the capacity for service.
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Yervada Mandir, Chap. VI</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The incessant search for material comforts and their multiplication
is an evil. I make bold to say that the Europeans will have to remodel
their outlook. If they are not to perish under the weight of the comforts
to which they are becoming slaves a time is coming when those who are in
the mad rush today to multiplying their wants will retrace their steps
and say: what have we done?</P>

<P>But whether good or bad, why must India become industrialised in theWestern
sense? The Western civilisation is urban. Small countries like England
or Italy may afford to urbanise their systems. A big country like America
with a very sparse population perhaps, cannot do otherwise. But one would
think that a big country, with a teeming population with an ancient rural
tradition which has hitherto answered its purpose, need not, must not copy
the Western model. What is good for one nation situated in one condition
is not necessarily good enough for another differently situated. </P>
