<br><font color="#000000">The Islamic Republic of Iran and The&nbsp; Republic
of India hereinafter referred to as the Sides:</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Conscious of the civilisational affinities and
historical links between the two countries,</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Noting their shared interests, common challenges
and aspirations as two ancient civilizations and as two developing countries.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Desirous of realising the vast potential of bilateral
co-operation in political, strategic, economic, technological and cultural
fields, including trade, industry, technology, energy, transportation and
agriculture,</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Convinced that strengthened bilateral relations
will be mutually beneficial and enhance regional peace and stability,</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Seeking to build upon the desire of the peoples
of both countries to develop closer ties,</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Declare and adopt the following:</font>
<p><font color="#000000">1. The sides affirm that respect for sovereignty
and territorial integrity, equality and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs are fundamental principles of friendly relations amongst
States. The Sides affirm that only an equitable, pluralistic and co-operative
international order can address effectively the challenges of our era.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">2. Affirming that Dialogue among Civilisations,
as a new paradigm in international relations, provides a conductive ground
for constructive interaction and effective cooperation, the sides call
upon the international community, in this UN year of Dialogue among Civilisations,
to rededicate itself to the principles of tolerance, pluralism and respect
for diversity and to share its commitment to promote the concept of Dialogue
among Civilisations.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">3. The sides reaffirm their commitment to the
goal of achieving general and complete disarmament under the effective
international control and in this regard, emphasise the need for conclusion
of a multilaterally negotiated agreement on the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons within a specific time frame. Both sides express concern
over restrictions on exports to developing countries of material, equipment
and technology for peaceful purposes and reaffirm, in this context, the
right of States to development, research, production and use of technology,
material and equipment for such purposes.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">4. The sides affirm the importance of preservation
of peace, security and stability in the region. Mutually beneficial trade
and transportation links as well as regional economic co-operation among
the countries of the region are essential factors for progress and development
of the entire region. The Sides note in particular the importance of secure
and peaceful environment to the development of commerce and the promotion
of economic growth in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean regions. The
Sides also consider security and stability in Central Asia of vital importance
to them.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">5. Both sides condemn terrorism in all its forms.&nbsp;

peace and security by the growing threat of international terrorism and
extremism.&nbsp; They also condemn states that aid, abet and directly support

against terrorism, including early finalisation of a Comprehensive Convention
on International Terrorism.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">6. The sides agree that the unity, territorial
integrity, independence and sovereignty of Afghanistan is crucial for the
maintenance of peace and stability of the region.&nbsp; They agree that
a military resolution to the civil conflict in Afghanistan is not possible
and the establishment of a genuinely broad based government representing
the aspirations of Afghan people is essential for the peace and stability
in Afghanistan.&nbsp; They also express their deep concern over the growth
of extremism and the threat of terrorism and illegal trade in narcotics
emanating from the area of the extremists.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">7. The sides consider globalisation as a challenge
of our time.&nbsp; While it should offer certain opportunities for growth
and development at present the benefits of globalisation are unevenly shared
among the nations and much remains to be done to ensure that its benefits
be comprehensively and equitably distributed at the global level.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">8. Flowing from their commitment to promote the
socio-economic development and prosperity of their peoples, the sides agree
to launch a new phase of constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation
covering, in particular, the areas of energy, transit and transport, industry,
agriculture and service sectors.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">9. The geographical situation of Iran and its
abundant energy resources along with the rapidly expanding Indian economy
and energy market on the other, create a unique complementarity which the
sides agree to harness for mutual benefit.&nbsp; In this context they agreed
to accelerate the process of working out an appropriate scheme for the
pipeline options and finalising the agreement reached on LNG.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">10. The sides reaffirm their commitment to strengthen
transport and transit cooperation.&nbsp; In this context and in line with
the proper implementation of Inter-governmental Agreement of International
North-South Corridor between Iran, India and Russia and Agreement on International
Transit of goods between Iran, India and Turkmenistan,&nbsp; they agree
to encourage the businessmen and traders of the two countries to better
utilise the said corridors.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">11. The sides agree to actively promote scientific
and technological cooperation, including among others, joint research projects,

on a regular basis.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">12. The sides emphasised the important role played

peace and stability among nations, agree to take necessary steps by the
concerned bodies of the two countries in expanding cultural and artistic
cooperation in all fields.&nbsp; The sides agreed to facilitate tourism

<p><font color="#000000">13. The sides reaffirm their commitment to the
strengthening and deepening of consultations and to enhancing their coordination
on bilateral regional and multilateral issues of common concern. In this
regard they will pursue and continue regular structured and comprehensive
mutual consultations.&nbsp; They note the useful contribution of the Joint
Commission as well as the Joint Business Council and resolve to further
enhance trade and economic links, including through facilitation of visits
and exchanges.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">14. The sides welcome the role played by interaction
between the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the Indian Parliament as

and resolve to enhance it further.&nbsp;</font>
