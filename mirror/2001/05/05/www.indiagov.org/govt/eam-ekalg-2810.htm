<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Jaswant Singh, Chief of Indian Diplomacy praised
the relations between Algiers and New Delhi and underlined the promising
co-operation horizons between them on bilateral and international levels.
In his interview with El-Khabar, he emphasised that the Indian Government
does not consider the parties that encourage terrorism and refuse to discuss
with them. He addressed a message to Pakistan saying that encouraging violence
and terrorist actions does not serve any side.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q: </b><i>What are your impressions after the
first visit of its kind you paid to Algeria and what is the reason for
the absence of visits between the two countries during the last decade?&nbsp;</i></font>
<p><font color="#3366FF"><b>A: </b>Its true that this is my first visit
to Algeria but I want you to know that it wont be, God Willing, the last.
The exchanges between Algeria and India have not yet reached the expected
level and we have an important work to achieve on questions and issues
of common mutual interests. The present circumstances present us a chance
to consolidate co-operation and intensify relations between the two governments
and people of Algeria and India. Indian and Algerian people have longstanding
friendly relations and their present wish to promote the bilateral co-operation
relations, represents a new chapter in the long course of our friendly
relations characterised by exchange of high officials visits between both
countries and the latest visit by Indian Minister of Commerce to Algeria
last June.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q: </b><i>Were any investment agreements concluded
during your visit to Algeria or did you find out any investments opportunities
that the Algerian Economy provides and are their any projects in this field?&nbsp;</i></font>
<p><font color="#3366FF"><b>A: </b>Yes, we have discussed the question
of investments and there are real possibilities to consolidate the co-operation
in this field, Algeria is now in the phase of getting out from a centralised
and planned economy and changing to a State based on market economy and
private companies. We decided to co-operate in many sectors and enhance
private businessmen to work together in the small and medium enterprises,
pharmaceuticals industries, infrastructures like energy, hydrocarbons industries
in addition to transport and telecommunication sectors as well as other
fields. As for investments contracts, no contract have been signed so far
because there are details that needed to be known. The work will start
later.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q: </b><i>Indian Government always refused
to grant Kashmiri people the right of self-determination, what are the
reasons?</i>&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF"><b>A: </b>Let me first of all explain you an important
thing that the question is not of self-determination. The state is an integral
part of the country, and its complete name is not Kashmir but Jammu &amp;
Kashmir. It is not question of self determination or so. From 1948 till
now seven elections were organised in the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir
to elect members of State legislature and members of central Parliament.
For instance, Indian Minister of Commerce Mr. Omar Abdullah who visited
Algeria in June 2000, was a member of the government and representative
of Jammu Kashmir State in the Parliament. On the other hand, people of
this State participated in at least 11general elections during the last
fifty years. The utmost importance nowadays is to stop encouragement of
the violation of Indian territorial integrity. And we must also stop killing
innocents, women and children in Kashmir. One factor to be pointed out
is that the Indian central government should grant more liberty to the
States and local Administrations.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q:</b><i>You have organised recently negotiations
with Hizbul Mudjahedin, one of the active armed parties and groups in Jamu
Kashmir. But these later were frozen, why? And what is the role of Pakistan
in the conflict of Kashmir?&nbsp;</i></font><i><font color="#FF0000"></font></i>
<p><b><font color="#3366FF">A: </font></b><font color="#3366FF">You must
be aware that the parties that encourage terrorism are not taken in consideration.
It should also be clear that we have always refused to talk to them. Consolidation
of peace has actually started. It is developing and there is important
work to achieve. Children are called to go to school and it is necessary
to provide people with employment. People desire normal life far from killings
and violence, and Indian government always strives to encourage the consolidation
of peace and securitv and activate the role of civil society. On the other
hand, Pakistan should reconcile with its history and geography and realise
that encouraging violence and perpetrating terrorist actions will not serve
any of the two sides.</font>&nbsp;<b><font color="#FF0000"></font></b>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q: </b><i>India is one of the countries, which
refused to sign the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, could you remind
its about your country's stand in this regard? And what are the conditions
for your signing this convention?&nbsp;</i></font><i><font color="#FF0000"></font></i>
<p><b><font color="#3366FF">A: </font></b><font color="#3366FF">There is
a difference between Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non
Proliferation Treaty. As far as the first is concerned, it was enforced
in 1970 and India has a crystal clear stand on this matter for the last
30 years. In spite of our readiness to sign it, we refuse this since we
think its creates a discriminatory and artificial system in the world because
of the double and unbalanced view in dealing with the question of nuclear
explosions and the nuclear armament proliferation ban.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">As for CTBT it comprises nuclear test explosions
only and aims to define and develop nuclear tests and explosions. But since
1995 and in spite of the broadening of the zone of the convention, the
situation remains standstill and nuclear tests and explosions continued
regardless of the Article 6 of nuclear armaments proliferation ban convention
that called nuclear countries to reduce their arsenal in this field. On
this basis, we consider that the convention holds a discriminatory feature
principally because of its non respect by nuclear power countries.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q: </b><i>Pakistan on its part refuses to ratify
the nuclear armaments proliferation ban convention and lays down the condition
that India undertake to ratify it, for it to join this convention. Don't
you think that this will affect the nuclear peace not only in the region
but also in the world?&nbsp;</i></font><i><font color="#FF0000"></font></i>
<p><b><font color="#3366FF">A: </font></b><font color="#3366FF">I will
answer your question in two parts: first of all, the use of nuclear energy
is for peaceful purposes through an agreement between India and Russia.
Secondly, concerning the Indian nuclear program, which was not, is not
and will not be focused against Pakistan.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q: </b><i>The situation in the Middle East
reaches a dead lock, how do you react to the Israeli attacks against Palestinians
and Muslims holy sites? And what is the stand of India about the situation
in the region and peace and war horizons?</i></font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#3366FF"><b>A: </b>I visited Gaza recently ... India was
one of the first countries that recognised the Palestinian State and expressed
its support to Palestinian people, and so far we have the same position
and we express our support to the rights of Palestinian people for a State
with internationally recognised borders. And we expressed our concerns
on the prevailing situation in the Middle East and the exacerbation of
violence and that civilians especially children are targeted. In this regard
we support all international resolutions particularly the Geneva convention
on the protection of civilians.&nbsp;</font>
