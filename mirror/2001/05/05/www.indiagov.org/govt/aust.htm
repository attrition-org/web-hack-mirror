<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The world has not dealt very well with India,
nor has India dealt very well with the world. But as Paul Keating observed
in a speech late last year an adequate architecture for the world cannot
be created without finding a place for the democratic government that speaks
for the one billion people of India. By testing nuclear weapons last March,
India has transformed the world we live in and posed a particular dilemma.
It has demonstrated the continuing acute relevance and utility of nuclear
weapons at a time when the end of the Cold War had led many people to hope
that the nuclear threat was fading. Even so, the failure of the five declared
nuclear weapons powers to make more meaningful progress towards nuclear
disarmament means they must bear a portion of the responsibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">More generally it is the failure to integrate
India a into the global institutional framework that contributed to India's
frustration and sense of insecurity. The particular dilemma of today lies
in the desire of the international system to make sure that India does
not derive any benefit from its nuclear tests while at the same time realising
that it is imperative to enrol India fully into the international system.
With a country of India's size and importance, this cannot be achieved
by coercion. Underlying this particular dilemma is a broader problem of
perception and political recognition. As Greg Sheridan argued in <I>The
Weekend Australian</I>, India presents many similar problems to Western
policy makers as did China 20 years ago. The West should have the same
debate about India as it has had about China. Is it better to engage India
or to contain India? Even to frame the debate in that fashion provides
its own answer. It must be better to engage India.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To do so effectively it is also necessary to treat
India as an emerging great power. India represents one-sixth of the human
race. It is the possessor of one of the great strands of human culture.
It has also, whatever its policy failings in different areas; been for
more than 50 years an exemplary democracy - an astonishing achievement
given India's level of poverty. India's shift to a market-based economy;
albeit at a slower than optimal pace, involves a paradigm shift every bit
as great as the similar move by China over the past 20 years. It holds
out opportunities, for India and for the outside world, equally as great.
Canberra has recently had a poor relationship with New Delhi, which needlessly
limits our ability to participate in the great, historical venture of Indian
modernisation. We should repair that relationship and offer intellectual
leadership, not least to Washington, on the fundamental and inescapable
importance of finding a new paradigm for India's place in the world.</FONT></P>
