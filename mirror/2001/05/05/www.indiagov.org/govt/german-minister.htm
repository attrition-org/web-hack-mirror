Berlin. <i>The Foreign Minister of Germany, Mr. Joschka Fischer, is an
engaging politician. A member of the Greens, the junior partner of the
present government, he has followed a pragmatist line in the conduct of
foreign affairs. In the process, he succeeded in reconciling the positions
of his party with the compulsions of governmental policies. It was a relaxed
Mr. Fischer who responded to my questions mostly on bilateral matters in
his office which was once the citadel of the GDR. Here are his abridged
answers to some of the questions:</i>
<p><b>Germany seems to have embarked on a serious lead to engage India
- of this, your visit is the most important element. What specifically
is intended to be achieved in immediate and medium terms?</b>
<p>Mr. Fischer: First of all, India is now one of the most important players
in the world and we can say will play a major role. India is politically
and also economically a very important partner for the EU and it is difficult
to have a national view and an European view. We are very much interested
to hear the views of the Indian Government about the regional situation.
We are concerned and we had a discussion about the situation in the sub-
continent and we hope that there will be a positive process between the
neighbours, between India and Pakistan. We expressed our concern on the
nuclear issue in the sub-continent and I think it is very
<br>important to maintain a substantial, deep and trustful relationship
between our two governments. We are hoping for a very important cultural
event (reference to the German Festival of India to begin later this year).
We regret (the controversy) in Germany over the green cards but this was
domestic politics by the Opposition.
<p><b>Has it paid those who raised the issue in the election (the important
poll in the biggest State, North Rhine Westphalia on Sunday)?</b>
<p>This issue was rejected by the majority of voters - they rejected the
position of the Christian Democratic Party. It is very unfriendly. It is
foolish, when we are looking to our own interests, to take such a position
(reference to the opposition criticism of the green cards for Indians).
<p><b>Two years ago, the bilateral relations took a difficult turn - in
the wake of India's nuclear tests. That phase looks to be a thing of the
past. This much is evident from the intensity and frequency of contacts.
What, precisely, was the turning point?</b>
<p>We are a non-nuclear nation. We are concerned about the regional or
global arms race especially nuclear weapons race not only in the sub-continent
but also in the surroundings - in West Asia there are strong efforts to
speed up long range missile technology. We fear it could lead to regional
de- stabilisation. Therefore, it is very important to have these discussions.
We are very much interested in discussions with our Indian counterparts
and of course, there are differences...
<p><b>But what was the turning point?</b>
<p>I do not see a turning point. May be the turning point was the change
of the Government (in Germany). India is playing more and more an important
role and particularly important were the visits of the Security Adviser
(Mr. Brajesh Mishra) and of the Foreign Minister (Mr. Jaswant Singh). We
had also the visit of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to India which
has shown that the United States is interested in improvement of the relations.
There is no typical turning point but it was a steady change.
<p><b>How far has the strategic dialogue between the two countries progressed.
Its highlights?</b>
<p>The security dialogue is in Pakistan's strategic interest in the region.
It is also in the interest of the role India plays as a nuclear power.
It is based on the (factors) of regional stabilisation as well as India's
interest in the European Union and of course, in Germany. Asia today is
one of the most important continents but, at the same time, it seems from
the European viewpoint very fragile and complicated specially on security
issues. The dialogue is in our interest and, of course, in the interest
of the relations between the strategic (positions) and economies. Economic
reforms and opening of the Indian economy are the major elements for a
stronger interest in India, together with the important role that India
has to play in strategic matters.
<p><b>On nuclear issues, the two sides have divergent views. What are the
chances of initiatives for exploring areas in which their positions could
be reconciled? Something like the dialogue between India and the U.S. Any
specific ideas on the subject?</b>
<p>It would not be nice to tell or to have a discussion now or to open
the dialogue through the newspapers (before meeting with my counterpart
in New Delhi). This is a question I can answer at the end of the visit;
after the talks. It will be impolite to explain our ideas before a very
open discussion with my colleague.
<p><b>Some of the G-8 nations adopted the approach of sanctions. Others
are not for it. What is going to be the stand of Germany? The fact that
development cooperation assistance was discontinued has not gone unnoticed
in India.</b>
<p>Our position is quite clear: we see a close relation between all issues.
We as a non-nuclear power are interested in security and stability - especially
we do not want a nuclear arms race - and we are in close discussion with
our Indian friends about our concerns. We had discussions at different
levels. On the other side, we (got) a very good explanation of the position
of the Indian side. We are now at a point where sanctions are not in the
centre of our discussions, not only with us but also with Mr. Clinton.
Sanctions reflected concerns about new arms race. We are not only looking
at India, but also there is Pakistan. There is China around. We as a non-
nuclear nation are concerned about developments in the world of today and
we want to talk to our friends about that.
<p><b>You mean with the passage of time the focus has shifted. It is not
the same thing as it was.</b>
<p>From my point of view, we will focus on improvement of relations. We
had the G-8 decision which still exists. But I hope step by step with improved
discussions, we can have a productive development in the future. This would
be very helpful. India is one of the leading powers of the world and as
a nuclear power, has, from our point of view, strong responsibilities for
international order.
<p><b>How would you describe the prospects of economic cooperation in trade
and investment?</b>
<p>I will be accompanied by a strong delegation of the German business
community. Many business companies are engaged in India but we are looking
forward to India improving its relations with the European Union. We are
ready for an open dialogue. When talking about economy, we must think of
the E.U. because Europe is the key factor for our economy. We cannot separate
that, we can have bilateral agreements but for economic and trade relations
we have to think along double lines - Berlin on one hand and Brussels on
the other. I think the Indian Government knows that very well.
<p><b>Is there going to be a joint declaration at the end of the discussion
and what is it going to be like?</b>
<p>There is a document in preparation for the common efforts.
<p><b>Germany is going to be the Head of the South Asia Task Force (on
nuclear issues) under a G-8 arrangement. This does not create a very happy
reaction in India. Your views?</b>
<p>Within the G-8, (the chairmanship of the Group) is always transferred
every half year - from a non-nuclear to a nuclear state. In the second
half of the year, we will have its chairmanship. We hope that we can have
productive results. This Force was created by the G-8 and there is a specific
mechanism for transferring chairmanship.
<p><b>How does Germany look at the situation in South Asia - on India-
Pakistan issues in particular? Germany, on its own and as part of the E.U.
has called for the resumption of dialogue. That was also the stand of the
U.S. but it was modified somewhat after Mr. Clinton's visit - the U.S.
now would like Pakistan to take the first credible step to create proper
environment for talks. Obviously, the U.S. saw the strength of the Indian
sentiment against trans-border terrorism.</b>
<p>We condemn strongly terrorist attacks of all kinds in India - and everywhere
in the world. When you had to suffer the hijacking of the plane, immediately
we were in contact with the Indian authorities and asked whether they needed
any help. We were shocked and deeply concerned; condemnation of terrorist
acts is part of our policy. Secondly, we were in full support of the Lahore
process because we think this was a very good track for dialogue and there
could be a possibility of clarifying the positions and then to find solutions.
We still fully support this idea. I think it is very important. On the
other side, we understand not only the concerns of our Indian partners
but also their commitment to the dialogue and the problems which were created
in this process which India was telling us were not created by it. What
we can do is to restore a climate where problems can be solved by dialogue
and not by the use of force or by confrontation.
<p><b>Of late, there is a new awareness of the importance of the sanctity
of the Line of Control in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Your comments?</b>
<p>It was never questioned by Germany or the European Union and, therefore,
we hope that this problem will be solved peacefully and by dialogue. It
is not a question theoretically of the Line of Control because there will
be no peace if there is armed infiltration or terrorism, cross-border terrorism.
What we can do or will do is to support the forces of peace and this means
acceptance of the existing borders. In Europe we know for centuries there
are two possibilities - not to accept borders which means war, or to accept
borders, sit down on the table, try to find a solution peacefully. I think
we are for the second possibility.
<p><b>To vary the subject, what is Germany's stand on reforming the U.N.,
so as to bring it in tune with the current realities? And your views on
India's claim for a permanent seat in an expanded Security Council?</b>
<p>Our position is quite clear - we think the U.N. structure, specially
the Security Council, reflects the structure of the world of the Cold War,
not of the 21st century. Things are changing. We are in full support of
the reform of the structure of the U.N. and the Security Council. We are
in favour of the opening of the Security Council for new members. We are
working for our membership together with Japan. There are regional groups
and in one of these regional groups India is at the top. But you also know
that in regional groups, not only in yours but in ours, there is some sort
of competition and I think it will not be too easy to overcome this obstacle.
With the announcement of the US Secretary of State that they will be ready
to open the Security Council (strength) to 21, there can be a positive
signal.
<p><b>The regional grouping test is a complicated matter. The better course
is to decide the matter on merit.</b>
<p>We are in strong support for India. You are one of the biggest and most
important powers in the world and we rely on your support.
