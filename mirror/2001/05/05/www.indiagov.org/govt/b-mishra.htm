<p><i>Sanctions may not be lifted, a breakthrough in Indo-Pak ties is not
likely. But the Prime Minister's US-visit beginning Thursday is part of
the "consolidation process" that began with President Clinton's visit,
said the PM's Principal Secretary <b>Brajesh Mishra</b>, speaking to <b>Harish
Gupta</b> on a range of issues. Excerpts:&nbsp;</i>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">What is the single most important
achievement you expect from the Prime Minister's visit to the USA?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>WE </b>are not going there for a
single achievement. We are going. there for a consolidation process that
began in March. This consolidation has to be in several fields - India's
place in the international arena, Asia, economic co-operation, science
and technology between the two countries. And, of course, the question
of cross-border terrorism will be raised by us.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">This visit is being seen as a gesture
reciprocating Clinton's visit. Do you expect anything in concrete terms?</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>I</b> don't think we should look
at Clinton's visit to India merely as part of creating an atmosphere. There
were some policy considerations behind his visit and those considerations
are still valid. So there maybe... after this (Clinton) administration...
a Democrat or a Republican as the next President but the India policy would
continue.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">So US. policy will be unchanged
whatever the poll outcome?</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Yes</b>, the US policy has bi-partisan
support. The PM will be meeting the India Caucus in Washington which is
a joint forum of both Republicans and Democrats.</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">What about the US statement that
the will of the Kashmiri people must be taken into account for resolving
the dispute?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>It</b> is not a new formulation
that has been used by the United States. This formulation is seen for the
last 5-6 years. They say there must be an agreement between India and Pakistan
and they must take into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people.</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">What is your response?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>We </b>say that the wishes of the
Kashmiri people have already been taken into account. The trouble today
is that of cross-border terrorism. The infiltration either from Pakistan
or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into India has been the bone of contention.
This is the core issue. What the USA, European Union and the rest of the
world is saying is that there must be a dialogue between India and Pakistan.
But Pakistan must create an atmosphere for that dialogue.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Do you see the emergence of such
an atmosphere during the next few weeks?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Honestly</b>, I cannot answer it
in either yes or no. All I can say is that so far there is no evidence
that General Musharraf is either able or willing to put an end to this
cross-border terrorism. It is not as if we are not prepared to talk to
Pakistan. But the real cause of problem is cross-border terrorism... The
focus of the visit will be on Indo-US relations.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">But there is no lifting of sanctions,
no concessions.</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>We</b> have not heard anything about
it. We are not going to ask or plead for lifting of the sanctions. But
we are certainly going to say that the full potential of Indo-US relations
cannot be realised if the sanctions are in place. And it is not in the
interest of the either country that sanctions continue.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">So in concrete terms what has Clinton
done for us?</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>One </b>can say that through his
visit India is more visible on the radar of the USA.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">What are the prospects of the PM
meeting George Bush Jr?</font></b>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>I </b>doubt whether there will be
a meeting between the PM and Bush. We were for it. But since the visit
to US has been cut short and San Francisco leg is off, it has become difficult
to work this out. But let me make it clear that the Republicans' India
policy is also going to be the same. You can see their policy statement.</font>
