<td><i><font color="#333333"><font size=-1>PUTRAJAYA (Malaysia), FEB. 5.
The Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, was in a relaxed mood
when he spoke to The Hindu at his office for nearly 45 minutes in Putrajaya,
the new federal government administrative centre.&nbsp;</font></font></i><font size=-1></font>
<p><i><font color="#333333"><font size=-1>Dr. Mahathir, known to speak
his mind, spoke on a wide range of issues - bilateral relations with India,
developments in South- East Asia, his views about globalisation and the
West as well as the need for religious tolerance.&nbsp;</font></font></i>
<p>The following are excerpts from the interview:&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">The Hindu: Your Excellency, how would you describe
the current status of bilateral relations between India and Malaysia?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Dr. Mahathir Mohamad: I think the relationship
is good. But, there is room for improvement - for closer relations and
more economic interaction.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In the context of economic cooperation, Malaysia
is India's largest trading partner in the ASEAN. And, Malaysia and India
are both investors in each other's country. How do you see this relationship
fructifying into anything solid? Your efforts for the IT super-corridor
here - any prospects for greater cooperation?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">India is now opening up; there are opportunities
not only for us to export to India but also to invest in India. And Malaysia
is not new in this game. Indian investment in Malaysia has a longer history,
but it has not grown as it should.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">There are certain areas in which you have definite
expertise... your relative costs (of production) are lower than the costs
of other developed countries. So, there is a lot of scope for Indian investment
in Malaysia.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">As far as Malaysia is concerned, our investment
in India is really in the field of infrastructure. We are not manufacturing
anything there because we think you have as much knowledge and capacity
to manufacture what we can manufacture... in that area there will not be
much investment... probably in the ports area... I think we can go into
Indian ports and complement what we are doing here...&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">So, there is a complementarity here because while
we can invest in your infrastructure, you can invest in manufacturing for
these new components, etc. The other area, of course, is the IT area where
India is making tremendous progress. We will need to work together with
you, we will need some of their expertise, we will need, probably, your
people also to work here. That means that there is a great deal of complementation
between India and Malaysia in terms of investment. I would expect that
this will be stepped up after the (now rescheduled) visit of the Prime
Minister.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">On South-East Asia. Our Prime Minister has concluded
a visit to Vietnam and Indonesia. How do you see this relationship between
India and South-East Asia?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">I think it can only benefit both sides. South-
East Asia is not booming at the moment as it used to because of the crisis
we are facing. We are largely trading nations. So, we need trading partners
and India should provide a good partner both in terms of sourcing various
requirements and essentials as well as export...&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Sir, you are the author of the East Asian Caucus
idea. Now, we see this idea has been realised in the ``ASEAN+3'' grouping.
Do you see, parallel to this, an ASEAN- India engagement at a high level?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">I think it will eventually have to come. But we
would think in terms of beginning with East Asia because there are certain
similarities with us and we are very familiar with the systems in East
Asia. Once that is set up, there will be first the need to interact with
India and subsequently, of course, there should be some kind of consensus
on an Asian grouping - not an ASEAN or East Asian grouping - but an Asian
grouping.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">India, as you know, has a summit-level meeting
with the European Union and is keen on a summit-level meeting with the
ASEAN as distinct from ASEAN+3. In a recent interview to The Hindu, Mr.
Abdurrahman Wahid (President of Indonesia) made the point that Malaysia
looks at the situation in SAARC. He said it is Malaysia's view that matters
must improve in SAARC...&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We have these dialogue partners and India is already
a dialogue partner. We can extract more from that kind of cooperation...
but, at the moment, the ASEAN is also (dealing) with its own problems.
We have to resolve some of those problems part of which were due to this
currency crisis which has destabilised a lot of ASEAN countries.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Here, I would like to ask you about the ideas
of globalisation. You are an articulate spokesman of the developing world.
How has Malaysia coped with this crisis, especially the new system of currency
controls that you have adopted?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We think we have done better than those countries
which have to resort to loans from the IMF. We are completely independent
financially. We don't borrow from the IMF or the World Bank. We do borrow
from Japan, but that's about all - but the terms are good enough for us.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Because of that we feel that our own approach
to the management of our own finances has worked. We feel confident that
there is no need to accept the common wisdom about how finances should
be managed. After all, the West has also formulated various formulas before
and they found that these formulas don't work. And then they changed. So,
you cannot claim that any formula designed in the West is going to serve
the world forever. They are going to, maybe, discard it and formulate a
new regime for finances... if they, themselves, are not always right, we
don't see why we should be following them simply because these are the
big nations. We have our own formula, we have our own way of dealing with
globalisation.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Well, when we first criticised globalisation there
were very few people saying anything against globalisation. But now...
a lot of people see in globalisation a lot of defects and disadvantages,
especially for the developing countries. We think there are many defects
because globalisation was formulated by the rich countries and, obviously,
they are going to formulate in a way that will benefit them. We see at
the moment that it is really benefiting them and not us. We have a lot
of ideas about what shape globalisation should take. At the moment, of
course, not very many people are listening to us. That doesn't matter.
If they don't listen to us, we'll manage by ourselves. But we think that,
eventually, they will see that it is a mistake to accept globalisation
as presently interpreted.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">India, too, has spoken for the developing world.
Do you think that in multilateral fora, especially the WTO, there can be
greater coordination between Malaysia and India?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">I think there should be. It would be very good
if we could work together because the problem with the countries of the
South is that they are fragmented mainly because they are placed under
obligation to the people who have lent them money, given them aid or to
whom they are obliged. They agree with us but they are not in a position
to say anything. We hope India and Malaysia can work together.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Malaysia has an independent defence policy. It
has looked towards self-reliance like India in the area of defence. India
has just tested its Light Combat Aircraft and there are suggestions in
the Indian press that New Delhi is interested in a regional consortium
to build this LCA. Do you think there is possibility of such cooperation
in the future?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We cooperate with many countries, we cooperate
even with the Russians, we cooperate with the British, we get their technology.
Our main concern is to be independent, not to be dependent on any one source.
So, if it pays for us to cooperate with India, certainly we will.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">It is no secret that India is interested in a
place in the United Nations Security Council as a permanent member. Just
want to know what Malaysia's position is on reform and India specifically?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">To us, Asian countries should be represented,
should be permanent members of the Security Council. Who that permanent
member is something that we Asians must agree upon. But what is important
to us is this veto power. We don't believe that any country should wield
that kind of veto where one country can negate the rights of 180 other
countries.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Perhaps a modified veto power which will, for
example, mean that at least two permanent members plus one other non- permanent
member exercise the veto. It's a kind of modified veto with the intention,
eventually, to do away with the veto.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">And on India, specifically, does Malaysia have
a position?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We have no position except that we would go along
with the general consensus of Asian countries - we would look at India
as an Asian country. It must be Asians who must decide.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The rest of Asia must decide rather than individual
countries taking a view. Would that be a correct expression of your view?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Yeah, everybody wants to be (a permanent member).
Indonesia wants to be, there are other countries...&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">India is a country with the second largest population
of Muslims in the world. Some people have a perception that relations between
India and Malaysia have been balanced by Pakistan on occasion. It's not
a stand-alone relationship. Do you feel it would be possible to move ahead
on that?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We have a relationship with all Islamic countries.
We are also regarded as an Islamic country. And because of that there is
a lot of Islamic influence in our stand, but at the same time you look
at Malaysia and you will see we have huge numbers of Hindu temples.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">In one square mile, sometimes you can have as
many as four-five Hindu temples because we are tolerant of other religions
and, although Islam is fairly rigid in its stance, here in Malaysia we
tolerate other religions and we expect that India, (with) its majority
made of Hindus, would have the same kind of tolerance for not just Islam,
but for other religions. That is our view... we regret, of course, if you
destroy a mosque. It is something that hurts the feelings, we cannot bring
ourselves to say, well, let the mosque be destroyed; that will not be acceptable
to our people.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">There are a lot of historical links between India
and Malaysia. We have lot of people here of Indian origin, they are Malaysians,
of course, but 10 per cent of them are of Indian origin. That does not
mean that they look at India as their homeland, Malaysia is their homeland
but culturally they are linked... there is that kind of historical, cultural
and lingual linkages. So, it would be easy for us to work closely together
with India. It all depends on the political will of each country. As far
as Malaysia is concerned, we have no problem... (in cooperating with India).&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Of course, in certain issues we might take our
own stand, different from India but I think you would recognise that every
country would have certain things that would be different from others.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You will be completing 20 years as Prime Minister
in July this year and have seen the region very closely. How do you see
developments in Indonesia and Philippines?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Well, it is unfortunate because what we saw was
a very stable South-East Asia for a long time. All of them (countries)
growing economically, all of them doing rather well. But when you have
a catastrophe deliberately caused by a currency devaluation that, of course,
has other effects... on the politics, on the economics of a country.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">What we are seeing is the aftermath of an assault
on the economy of countries. It happened to us, it could happen to anybody...
what we are seeing in South-East Asia is the effect of a rather deliberate
destabilisation of countries through economic means...&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Many people express concerns about Indonesia.
How do you look at this?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We don't normally comment on our neighbours, but
I would like to say we welcome Indonesia's swing towards democracy. We
also know that democracy is not the easiest system to work and what we
are seeing in Indonesia is the destabilisation caused by a rather sudden
change. That is something bad. While we should have democracy, the process
should be in phases so that people will be able to adjust to a system that
differs so much from the previous system.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Sir, it's well known that five-six years down
the line you may leave the office of Prime Minister. How do you see Malaysia
then?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">There will be changes, of course. No two persons
can lead in the same way. But the foundations have been laid. In Malaysia,
since the first Prime Minister, we have not really changed our policies.
It has been consistent and each leader will try to improve but along the
same line. We are not suddenly going to change 180 degrees as happens when
Governments change.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Parties winning and losing support is the game
of democracy. A lot is being made out of the loss of support for your party.
Are you concerned about this at all?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We will overcome it. We have lost support before,
we have lost the Governments of several States before. But we have come
around... of course, there are ups and downs. That's the essence of democracy...&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Do you see yourself leading the ruling alliance
into the next elections (due in 2003)?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">I don't know about that (chuckles). But, I will
be around for a little more time.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You are a moderate. There are some concerns about
parties like the PAS (Parti IslamSe Malaysia). Can a party like this change
your country?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">There is some danger that they might change (Malaysia).
I think, by and large, Malaysians are moderate people and they are not
ready to support any extreme parties.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Do you think that these tendencies can be accommodated
in your umbrella coalition?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3366FF">We are already doing that (talking to PAS). Except
that our ability to sell our product is very poor. People don't understand
us. They claim that we are not doing the right thing. It is for us to explain.</font>
