<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT COLOR="#A6773E"><FONT SIZE=+1>A weapons proliferation nightmare
is occurring in a nondescript factory complex in Fatehjung, a northern
Pakistani town in the hilly plain of Punjab.</FONT></FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Using Chinese supplied blueprints and technology,
Pakistan is nearing completion of a centre to produce a home-grown version
of Beijing's M-11 ballistic missile, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead
to a target some 300 Kilometres away.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">China's help on the factory is part of a secret
contract the two nations signed in early 1998. Under the pact, China also
sold about 30 M-11s to Pakistan during the early 1990s, top U.S. officials
believe. But teaching Pakistan to make its own missiles raises the proliferation
problem to graver level, especially in volatile South Asia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The history of the M-11 tells much about China's
role in the global problem of weapons proliferation today. Once, China
sold weapons mostly for money, or, in its Marxist heyday, for ideological
reasons. That reputation for recklessness lingers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But a close examination of the 10-year record
of M-11 transfers to Pakistan shows that China now is a calculating, strategic
proliferator. Russia often sells weapons technology because its economic
crisis leaves officials and ministers grasping for chances to earn hard
currency, and the U.S. leaks weapons know-how because it simply can't contain
its explosion of technology. China, by contrast, more often exports high
powered weapons and technology in a cool pursuit of specific policy goals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Pakistan proves the point. China long ago concluded
that Pakistan has a special role in the pursuit of Beijing's abiding foreign-policy
goals. These include bolstering Pakistan's defences against India, China's
neighbour and the South Asian regional power, and ensuring that Islamic
Pakistan doesn't stir up already restive Muslims in China's nearby Xinjiang
province.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;China sees a weak Pakistan as destabilising
for the region,&quot; says Han Hua, a proliferation specialist at Beijing
University.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Above all, China wants to use Pakistan as a buffer
to thwart feared encroachment first from the old Soviet Union and, perhaps
someday, from a resurgent Russia. U.S. analysts believe the 1998 contract
to sell M-11s was drawn up in this context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Over the years, China has shown remarkable persistence
in its use of weapons sales to Pakistan to achieve its goals, regardless
of world opinion or even the threat of sanctions. Occasionally, knowing
it already has buttressed Pakistan with a considerable amount of arms and
technology, China slows the pace or shifts tactics under international
pressure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If China is a strategic proliferator, both the
Bush and Clinton administrations have been Beijing's enabler. Despite intense
congressional opposition, both administrations have sought engagement with
China and tried to avoid provocations that would endanger access by U.S.
companies to China's vast markets. On two occasions, the U.S. has interpreted
anti proliferation laws in a way that avoided imposing the most draconian
sanctions on China.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">China gives the U.S. the wiggle room to do this
by walking up to the line of serious anti proliferation violations, but
then either not crossing it or shrouding its actions in ambiguity. Several
U.S. officials acknowledge privately that there is a fairly convincing
evidence that Beijing probably has shipped some 30 M-11s missiles to Pakistan's
Sagodha Air Base, west of Lahore - an action that would call for severest
penalties under U.S. antiproliferation law. But the weapons remain in their
crates more than five years after their arrival. This permits the administration
to claim it doesn't have conclusive proof that they are there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;There's been a tacit understanding that
the M-11s wouldn't be taken out and tested,&quot; says Robert Oakley, a
former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Chinese officials won't comment on the M-11 transfers.
But U.S. analysts say the M-11 is capable of carrying an 495 kilogram payload
about 300 kilometres. Pakistan has the technology and the nuclear capability
to arm the missile with a nuclear warhead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The U.S. also used that wiggle room in late 1992,
when a hot-button issue prompted China to ship what intelligence officials
insist were 34 M-11s to Pakistan. President George Bush, in a tight re-election
race and heeding pressure from Congress and the ailing post-Cold War U.S.
defence industry, announced that he would sell F-16 aircraft to Taiwan,
which China considers a runaway province. In response, the unhappy Chinese
appeared to ship missiles to Pakistan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Once more, there were protracted discussions and
Chinese evasion. But now it was the Clinton administration that had to
grapple with the problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It also had to deal with Republican Senate. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, who toughened the penalties for Chinese proliferation
so that entire sectors of China's economy, not merely individual companies,
would have to penalised for violations. Now, the most severe penalty would
disrupt billions of dollars in trade.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One senior U.S. official concedes that this raised
the stakes. It also increased the need for a high level of confidence in
the information that officials used to make a determination. After a rancorous
internal debate, the administration once more concluded that it was not
absolutely certain that complete missiles had been shipped to Pakistan.
And so, on August 24, 1993, the Clinton administration again imposed the
milder level of sanctions on China.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">China refused to discuss the issue until U.S.
sanctions were lifted. Again, the U.S. gave ground. In late 1994, Secretary
of State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen signed
an agreement stating that the U.S. would waive the sanctions, and &quot;once
the United States lifts the sanctions, China will not export ground-to-ground
missiles,&quot; such as the M-11.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since then, the administration hasn't detected
any more missile transfers to Pakistan, even though the 1988 contract with
Pakistan called for the delivery of about 60 M-11 missiles. Perhaps with
the Soviet threat gone, and a thaw with India, China decided to focus on
its new interest in U.S. ties, officials say.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lately, U.S. intelligence monitors have noticed
a curious development at a M-11 factory in the small trading town of Fatehjung,
off the main road from Islamabad to Peshawar. Although the U.S. had expected
the turnkey project to be completed by now, it hasn't yet received certain
important equipment from China needed to achieve that goal, according to
people familiar with the situation. This could be the latest example that
China will at least slow down when the risks of proliferation become too
great. But whether it will stop is a question nobody in Washington can
answer. </FONT></P>
