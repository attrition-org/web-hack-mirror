<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#9D7A5E"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We were
the ones who were over-confident&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/pm.gif" ALT="Prime Minister" HEIGHT=141 WIDTH=159 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Have
you been able to understand why the Opposition toppled you?</B> </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>They thought
they would bring down the government and form their own. But they ignored
the contradictions within their fold—the AIADMK and TMC cannot go together,
neither can Mulayam Singh Yadav and the BSP. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do you think
the Opposition was overconfident about forming an alternative... </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Nahin, sach mein,
overconfident to hum ho gaye. It is not too difficult to manage one vote.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You have run
a coalition for 13 months with Jayalalitha as a key ally. Have you been
able to understand her? As journalists we haven’t. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Neither have
I. She came home and lunched with us and we spoke of all things under the
sun. She sat with us for one-and-a-half hours. She spoke at length of how
she has been implicated in cases and how she’s being harassed. She felt
that the cases should be transferred (out of the DMK-run Tamil Nadu state
government’s purview), that the cases should be withdrawn. She did not
say a word on Admiral Bhagwat, nor about corruption. But as soon as she
left our house—what she said to the press waiting outside was okay—but
as soon as she reached the hotel she spoke of a political earthquake. How
did this ‘political earthquake’ occur in the hotel? I have just not been
able to understand why this happened. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Perhaps she
was angry with you...she has accused you of leaking the note (asking for
the reinstatement/transfer of certain officials). </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I did not leak
it. Her saying that I leaked the note at Karunanidhi’s behest is incorrect.
I don’t know from where it was leaked. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But she did
hand that note to you? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes...she gave
me some information after speaking to me for one-and-a-half hours but everybody
knows...</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>...that all
she spoke about were her corruption cases?</B> </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>(Laughs) Unhe
aur kisi ki chinta nahin thi...yeh jo transformation hua, woh kyon hua
(she didn’t seem worried about anything else...why did this transformation
take place)?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Possibly Subramanian
Swamy instigated her? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I don’t comment
on him. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>When do you
think the mid-term polls should be held—June or September? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>They should be
held as quickly as possible. And the earliest is June. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do you prefer
a June election or will you leave it to the Election Commission? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>We prefer a June
election. And we feel that the Election Commission will/should also reach
the same decision. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But will the
revision of electoral rolls be over by then? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>If it isn’t,
it can be stopped. This has been done in the past. Polling is possible
in June. Otherwise I will be running a lame-duck government for too many
months. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Isn’t it going
to be terribly hot in June? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, it will
be hot, but elections have been held in June earlier. People can come and
vote in the morning and evening (when it is relatively cooler) and the
polling time can also be extended late into the evening. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Congress
is saying that you want an early poll to take advantage of the ‘sympathy
factor’... </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>And those who
are opposing it are doing so to prevent us from getting any advantage of
this sympathy wave! </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What’s your
feeling? Is there a sympathy wave in your favour? What’s your feedback?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Log dukhi hain,
with the manner in which the government was toppled. Our feedback is that
people believe the government was removed through manipulation. By one
chief minister’s vote who shouldn’t have been there, at that. And that
this should not have happened. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But isn’t
it a fact that the Congress will make stability an issue and say that ‘look,
no non-Congress government can last its term’?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>People have seen
what kind of government the Congress has provided. And anyway, the Congress
has toppled the governments which have gone over the last few years—Chandra
Shekhar, Deve Gowda, Gujral. In fact, they have created the instability.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Will this
be a vicious election with charges and counter-charges being traded? There
seems to be a lot of bad blood... </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>How ‘hot’ the
election will be, is too early to say. But certain norms should be maintained,
it should be a clean election. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Opposition
has criticised you for breaking norms by making a ‘party political’ broadcast
(on April 28) despite being a caretaker PM.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I don’t agree
with this. Arre, can’t a prime minister on his way out even address the
people to say goodbye?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What will
be your coalition’s main poll plank? Will ‘stability and good governance’
work for you this time too? Because on both grounds you haven’t come out
very strongly in the past 13 months. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The ruling coalition—apart
from Jayalalitha—has been very stable. And till the end our unity was maintained.
Even the one-member parties from the Northeast have stayed with us. Of
course stability will be an issue for us. Even in terms of governance,
though we had a troublesome first six months, the latter half went very
well. People were seeing the results of our policies, the economy was improving
and on security there can be no complaints.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Did things
start looking up after your Lahore trip? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, you could
say that. Nobody believed we could do something like this. And you can’t
even imagine the positive effect of the Lahore bus ride in the international
community. Now, whenever Pakistani leaders travel abroad and try to raise
the Kashmir issue, the response they get is that you are talking to India
anyway, you discuss it with them bilaterally.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What made
you get on to the bus? Whose idea was it?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The credit goes
to Nawaz Sharif. He said he could even travel to India on the bus...</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But you beat
him to it! </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>(The Prime Minister
guffaws.) </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Seriously
though, was it a well-thought out move or a spontaneous gesture?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was a spontaneous
gesture on my part. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Only a meeting
of Sharif and you, both leaders of ‘hardline’ parties, could have had this
effect. Is there a lesson for the world’s ‘liberals’ in this? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, that’s
how it has been with me from the very beginning. Our relations with Pakistan
took a turn for the better during my tenure as foreign minister in the
Janata government. In fact, even with China the ball was set rolling by
me. I laid the basis for maintaining positions on the border, though of
course later Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Raoji also did quite a bit. If
our government had lasted, the border problem with China would have been
resolved. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You seem to
have a special interest in improving Indo-Pak relations. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, not only
Pakistan. I want good relations with all our neighbours, but the key to
that is that India should not behave like a ‘Big Brother’. Sometimes this
impression is created unintentionally, some of course behave like this
deliberately. But these are the smaller nations and we have to keep them
with us. After all there is so much scope for cooperation.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Did Sharif
too have a genuine desire to improve ties? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, certainly.
He did a lot which went far beyond the bounds of protocol. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What’s been
the single-most important achievement of your government? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>That a non-Congress
government too can function and successfully at that! Till now the Congress
has claimed that nobody can run a government apart from them. We proved
them wrong. And by toppling our government they’ve given us an opportunity
to say that if it wasn’t for their destabilisation, we would’ve lasted
the full term. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You have been
the target of some personal attacks from the Opposition and also from the
RSS and its affiliates. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>People have been
very kind to me. In the debate on the confidence motion in the Lok Sabha,
leaders of the Opposition—including those from the Congress, even while
opposing me—did not say anything against me personally. I am told that
Sonia Gandhi was very angry at them for not attacking me. (Laughs).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You mentioned
earlier that you want a clean poll. How do you reconcile this with the
&quot;videshi mahila&quot; (foreigner) campaign some BJP leaders, allies
and affiliated organisations have launched against the Congress president?
</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I have said earlier
that this will not be an issue. But now it looks as if it is possible.
But even if the issue is raised, it should be within certain limits. Such
as a debate on the constitutional position in other countries like America
where naturalised citizens cannot run for the nation’s highest offices;
a debate should be limited to whether only an Indian-born citizen shall
aspire to become president, vice-president or prime minister. But it should
not be personalised. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So you disapprove
of those within your own party who’re playing this up. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>(Nods in agreement).
Yes, personally I don’t like it. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Are you going
to speak to them about it? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I have spoken
to them, but some don’t seem willing to listen. In fact, there are more
such people amongst our allies. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do you think
if overplayed, this could actually prove counter-productive? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>We have to wait
and see. I don’t know if there is a conscious decision whether to do it
or not. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the light
of your experience over the past 13 months, don’t you think the BJP’s ties
with the Sangh parivar affiliates—while they can’t be severed—need to be
redefined?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>All problems
have been sorted out. After the first six months there has not been this
problem. Those problems will not recur. We will not let that happen. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So the line
of moderation you have taken will prevail?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, yes. It
will be continued. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What’s your
feeling on the Bhagwat issue? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>There’s no need
for a debate on this. As I said in the House, if there are any charges
of corruption—in the purchase of armament or tanks—we are ready for an
inquiry. But there should be no debate on his sacking—whether it was right
or wrong. That’s the government’s prerogative. Civilian authority must
be supreme. How he (Bhagwat) was tolerated for so long is a source of amazement
to me. It’s also not true that the President was kept in the dark. He was
informed by us throughout. And as for the affidavit he (Bhagwat) had filed,
what can one say, he dragged everybody into it, beginning with V.P. Singh.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the past
13 months, despite the achievements, one major problem has been the attacks
on Christians... </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>It has been more
of media hype. I went to Gujarat. There was a local fight sparked off by
Christian youth stoning a Hindu rally on December 25, 1998. Permission
for this rally on Christmas day should not have been given by the administration.
It was a Hindu rally. If the rally had not taken place, nothing would have
happened. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Some believe
there’s an &quot;international conspiracy&quot; to defame your government?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>No, not conspiracy.
What’s meant by ‘conspiracy’? Of course, they want to spread Christianity.
Hum bhi saare sansar ko arya banana chaahte hain. We haven’t succeeded
(laughs), but that’s different. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You’re seen
as a good man, but a soft prime minister? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Even after Pokhran!
It was a testing time. Efforts were made to isolate India, but I withstood
it. One doesn’t have to shout to be effective. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Getting back
to problems in the BJP, is Kalyan Singh likely to be replaced in the next
three-four months? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>We will not disturb
him at this time. Some of those who’re unhappy with him came to meet me,
but they were only complaining about his style of functioning. Policies
and programmes, they have no problem with. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Is there any
truth in the reports about Bofors files being dusted up?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, I too have
seen the newsreports (Laughs, but doesn’t deny it).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Last time,
the BJP slogan was ‘Ab ki bari, Atal Behari’. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Now that you’ve
had a chance, what will it be this time? I don’t know. (Laughs loudly).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Which party
and individual do you consider your main opponent in the forthcoming elections?
</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the forthcoming
elections, our main opponent will obviously be the Congress and whomsoever
that party chooses to be its leader.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Will the campaign
be more ‘presidential’ with you and Sonia Gandhi in the fray? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Arre bhai, there
are other parties also. Different states have different ruling parties.
Anyway, has the Congress finally decided on who their leader will be?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But they’ve
more or less announced Sonia Gandhi’s name. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Only Arjun Singh
has. The CWC hasn’t made public its decision yet. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>A consensus
on signing the CTBT was expected after consulting all political parties.
How has the Lok Sabha dissolution affected this? How important is it for
the election process to be over before the September deadline? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Taking a decision
on signing the ctbt has certainly become difficult now. It will become
even more so if elections are held in September. I had stated in the dissolved
Lok Sabha—and I continue to adhere to this commitment - that any decision
in this regard will be taken only after taking Parliament into confidence.
In the changed circumstances, if the elections are not held by the end
of June, it would become necessary to consult the political parties to
arrive at a consensus on the issue of CTBT.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>How have mid-term
polls affected your government’s attempts to put an effective minimum deterrent
in place? Do you feel that, despite the success of Pokhran-II and Agni-II,
the doctrinal aspects of the nation’s security strategy are still incomplete?
</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>No. The nation’s
security-related programmes have not been derailed by the temporary instability
created by the Opposition. Even in the interregnum, we shall continue to
give the fullest attention to all aspects of national security, including
our ongoing resolve to put in place a minimum, effective and credible nuclear
deterrent. As far as our nuclear security doctrine is concerned, it has
been clearly enunciated in Parliament last year, and subsequently elsewhere
too. The basics of this doctrine are: non first-use of nuclear weapons,
non-use against non-nuclear-weapon countries, no nuclear arms race and
a credible minimum deterrent. In other words, we shall have an assured
response to any use of nuclear weapons against us.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Parties across
the political spectrum have demanded electoral reforms...</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Electoral reforms
brook no delay whatsoever. Both aspects of the electoral reforms—fixed
term for the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabhas and state funding of elections—are
crying out for a common approach by all the political parties. Especially
after the experience of the Congress party toppling three coalition governments
in a row and forcing the country to go for three general elections in as
many years, the need for effective reforms to ensure stability of governance
has become all the more apparent to all. The questions I asked while moving
the motion of confidence in the Lok Sabha on April 15—&quot;What is your
plan for an alternative government? What is its programme? Who will be
its leader?&quot;—will continue to be relevant in the future too, whenever
an incumbent government is sought to be voted out in Parliament.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Are you in
favour of the ruling coalition going to the people with a &quot;common
manifesto&quot; on the lines of the National Agenda for Governance? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The BJP has been
known as an ideology-driven party, but by keeping out contentious issues,
is there an implicit recognition by the BJP—unlike the Congress—that the
era of coalitions is here to stay? Is this the way forward for the BJP?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>All these questions
are under discussion at present, but the nag is a good basis for our common
programme for these elections; we have to tell the people what the government’s
programme will be. We can add to it and improve on it, of course. Parties
have their own ideology. But our experience has been that ideology is not
of much use in running a government. One needs a pragmatic approach, (there
are) practical considerations. The manifesto will be formulated on this
basis. One thing, however, is certain. The era of coalitions at the Centre
is here to stay. Whether the Congress party likes it or not makes no difference
to the ground reality. Indeed, the era of coalitions has begun precisely
because the Congress is rapidly on the downslide, having failed to fulfill
the aspirations and expectations of the various regional and social sections
of our diverse nation. Similarly, the BJP-led alliance is also here to
stay. In fact, it is stronger and more cohesive than in March 1998. Our
unity and our common approach to policies and programmes would be fully
reflected in the document we present to the electorate while seeking a
full and decisive mandate.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So you don’t
have a problem with the BJP not issuing its own manifesto? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes (I have no
problem). </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Is it also
fair to say that you believe the BJP should now concentrate on the politics
of governance rather than that of identity? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>(The politics
of) identity is there, but the pressing need of the hour is to build an

last year in Parliament that 1998 would be your last election. Is it fair

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I did say I would
fight no more elections. But I least expected that the Lok Sabha would
be dissolved before it had run through less than one-fourth of its scheduled
tenure. I have an unfinished agenda. You can say that the manner in which
our government was toppled has also steeled my determination to fight on.

maintain your tranquility despite enormous pressure? Is it because you

was going to be enthroned and when he heard that he was going into exile
for 14 years was the same.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

that a prime minister’s job these days is essentially to hammer out a consensus?

Yahi kam karna padta hai (That’s right. This is the kind of work one has
to do). </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
