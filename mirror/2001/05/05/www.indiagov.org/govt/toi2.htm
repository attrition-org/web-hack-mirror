<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Washington Post</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">WASHINGTON: The Clinton administration has discovered
no carrot, no stick, no argument persuasive enough to pry India and Pakistan
loose from the declared nuclear power status they seized last May. After
nine months of venting outrage and alarm, America and its allies are settling
into a quiet, conditional accommodation of Asia's new nuclear realities.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">They do so reluctantly, and outwardly determined
to punish India for the damage it does to the orthodoxy of global nonproliferation
and for provoking Pakistan into copycat nuclear testing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The US and India are engaged in a bruising test
of wills over the meaning of power in world politics today. India's chauvinistic
Bharatiya Janata Party government is determined to reap political influence
domestically, regionally and at the United Nations from its new status
as a declared nuclear power. The United States is determined to prevent
that from happening.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In its private messages to Washington and other
capitals, India has clearly stated an absolute determination to move from
testing to developing and maintaining &quot;a minimal deterrent'' - that
is, a small number of warheads and nuclear-capable missiles. It maintains
that these weapons would be trained not on Pakistan but on Chinese cities
to deter an attack from America's &quot;strategic partner,'' China.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;We do not seek parity in nuclear weapons
with any country, and we do not seek an arms race in our region,'' Brajesh
Mishra, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's national security adviser,
told European and American defense officials at the Munich Security Conference
this month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">European diplomats report that India has put strong
emphasis in private as well on the limited military nature of its nuclear
strategy. But Mr. Mishra hinted at his country's much broader political
ambition by predicting to the Munich audience that &quot;in the 21st century
a new security order is likely to arise in the Asia-Pacific region,'' in
which India should be granted as much respect and deference by the United
States and others as is China today.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">India's stress on minimal deterrence has made
it easier for Washington to come to terms conceptually with the military
implications of the Indian testing. This new mood of accommodation in Western
capitals on military essentials is signaled, although not acknowledged,
in a forthcoming magazine article by the administration's point man on
this crisis, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. He writes in the
March-April issue of Foreign Affairs: &quot;Having India and Pakistan stabilize
their nuclear competition at the lowest possible level is both the starting
point and the near-term objective of the US diplomatic effort. ... The
Clinton administration does not expect either country to alter or constrain
its defense programs simply because we have asked it to.''</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mr Talbott is concentrating on winning agreement
from New Delhi and Islamabad to halt testing, to stop producing fissionable
material and to refrain from deploying nuclear-capable missiles. &quot;Strategic
restraint'' will be rewarded with a further relaxing of US economic sanctions,
and other concessions including a long-delayed visit from President Bill
Clinton, the article indirectly suggests. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The tone of Mr Talbott's article is much sharper
in rejecting suggestions by &quot;some Indians ... that their country's
new, self-declared status as a nuclear power enhances its claim to permanent
membership on the UN Security Council.'' He adds, &quot;The United States
disagrees.'' He then lays out the argument that India must not be rewarded
politically in any way for its open defiance last May of the NPT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">New Delhi has already indicated privately that
it is willing to formally renounce nuclear testing and to halt the production
of fissionable material. But India wants to be satisfied that the West
will then recognize, at least implicitly, its right to a minimal deterrent.
Mr. Mishra and others say India wants an end to the nonproliferation treaty's
hypocrisy of granting a seal of approval to America, Russia, China, Britain
and France for developing nuclear weapons before 1968, and denying legitimacy
to anyone whose testing came after the treaty was signed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But the Indian testing is not the only development
in this decade that underlines the dysfunctional morality on which the
treaty is based. The treaty's ineffective inspection system and toothless
enforcement were exposed by the discovery of Iraq's advanced nuclear program.
Nor has the treaty deterred Iran, Libya and others from energetically seeking
a bomb, or Israel from building a powerful nuclear arsenal that it has
not acknowledged. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The growing realization among most other nations
that nuclear weapons are too expensive and dangerous for them to maintain
has become the true cutting edge of nonproliferation. South Africa, Brazil,
Argentina, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have dismantled arsenals or
development programs in this decade for reasons of national interest, not
because of treaty provisions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The treaty's own limitations have done as much
damage to its noble aims as have India's tests. A crusade to punish India
politically for being the messenger of a new and uncertain nuclear era
that challenges the established nuclear order may be temporarily satisfying,
but it is likely to be as untenable as were the initial US outrage and
diktats of last May. <I>(WP Svc)</I></FONT></P>
