<P>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,</P>

<P>I am happy to present to you the draft of the Nuclear Doctrine prepared
by the National Security Board. A copy has been placed in each of the seats
in the hall. We have decided to make this document public in keeping with
our position in favour of greater transparency in decision-making. Please
note that this is a draft proposed by the NSAB and has not yet been approved
by the Government. That will have to wait until after the general elections.</P>

<P>As our thinking on the nuclear tests has been fairly well publicised,
I do not intend to go over the ground again. Suffice it to say that this
was a step necessitated by the security environment and our need to ensure
for ourselves the element of strategic autonomy in decision making which
we will need in the coming years. Our position has all along been that
global security would be enhanced by the universal elimination of all nuclear
weapons, and this remains our conviction today. Unfortunately, the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 was in the reverse direction.</P>

<P>Our nuclear weapons are not country-specific but, as I mentioned earlier,
are aimed at providing us the autonomy of exercising strategic choices
in the best interest of our country, without fear or coercion in a nuclearised
environment. That being so, we have adopted a policy of minimum deterrence
as the basic building block of our nuclear thinking. Minimum but credible
deterrence is the watchword of our nuclear doctrine. From this, flows the
decision to adopt a no-first-use posture. We have therefore given unconditional
guarantees to States that do not have nuclear weapons, or are not aligned
with nuclear weapon powers.</P>

<P>A cardinal principle regarding the use of nuclear weapons is that of
civilian control. Only the elected civilian leader of the country is empowered
to authorise the use of nuclear weapons. As the recent operations in Kargil
have demonstrated, our system and the political leadership, believe with
great responsibility and restraint, as you would expect from the largest
democracy in the world. This sense of responsibility will also guide our
actions with regard to nuclear weapons.</P>

<P>With these words, I have great pleasure in releasing the document for
public discussion and debate.<BR>
