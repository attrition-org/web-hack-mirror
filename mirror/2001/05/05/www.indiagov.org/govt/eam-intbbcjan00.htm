<b>Philip Hayton, Presenter:</b> Welcome to Asia Today Programme. I am
Philip Hayton. In this programme, an exclusive interview with the Indian
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh. India and the United States have agreed
to form a Joint Working Group to counter terrorism. The decision was taken
during the talks in London between India's Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh
and the US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. The talks concentrated
on security and nuclear non-proliferation issues. The focus on terrorism
was pushed to the forefront after the December hijacking of an Indian Airlines
plane by Islamic militants. One of the aims of the Counter-Terrorism Working
Group will be to ensure that the perpetrators of the hijacking are brought
to justice. The talks produced no movement on the nuclear issues. Since
India conducted nuclear test in May 1998, Washington has been urging Delhi
to curtail its nuclear weapon programme. The United States is also keen
to reduce tension between India and Pakisatn, relations are at a low, with
Delhi accusing Islamabad of involvement in the December hijacking. Pakistan
strongly denies that. In a wide-ranging interview, my colleague Stephen
Cole asked Mr Singh about his talks with Mr Talbott and the growing international
concern about the high level of tension between India and Pakistan. He
began by asking whether the India-United States Counter-Terrorism Group
was linked to the hijacking of the Indian plane.
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> It is not a consequence of the hijacking alone
if that is what you mean by linking but it is a Joint Working Group that
India and United States have set up to combat the international menace
of terrorism because, assumption being, there is indeed such a menace and
it needs to be addressed jointly.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> Did the US, Did Mr. Talbott agree with India's
position that Pakistan was directly involved in hijacking?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> Well, we discussed it but it was not my expectation
that I will want from Strobe Talbott a judgement, one way or another. These
are necessarily issues that are considered at some length by various countries
from different angles.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> Now you also said that you talked
about nuclear issues.
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> Yes indeed. The non-proliferation and disarmament
issues.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> Did you tell Mr. Talbott when you would sign the
CTBT?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> No It is not question of so much of when
we will sign. Our position is very clear in this regard. We, in any case
continue to observe the voluntary moratorium on any further testing and
we have quite explicity stated that the commitment that India has made
of converting this voluntary moratorium into a de jure obligation requires
that we build within India as wide consensus as we can.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> With this continuing high level of tension worrying
the region so much, have you got any plans to try and reduce that high
level tension?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> Of course. Because we have demonstrated the steps
that we can take. India after all is the initiator of the dialogue and
the process of reconciliation, that is what the dramatic and historic bus
journey to Lahore was all about. It remains a matter of great regret and
disappointment, both to my Prime Minister as also to I personally, that
the bus was turned away from Lahore and sent to Kargil.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> As a result, can India take steps now to try and
reduce the level of tension?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> We will remain committed to dialogue and
reconciliation but it is obvious that for this, not as a pre-condition
but as an integral of the dialogue process itself, a proper environment
is created.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> What would that proper environment be?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> I think (a) the abjuring of violence (b)
I think there would have to be a demonstration of giving up encouragement
to cross-border terrorism which needs encouragement by agencies of State
and the State itself. And there will also have to be a secession to this
daily cry of Jehad against India. Also, the kind of very aggressive propaganda
that is carried out on a daily basis. These are not pre-conditions. These
are essential integrals for the creation of a proper environment.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> Pakistan is accusing India of being behind Monday's
bomb blast in Karachi. Was India involved at all?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> No. I heard of the bomb attack only here through
media and I find it completely unexpectable that India in any sense can
be involved. It was not an attack, it was a blast or something, yes.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>Pakistan accuses India of being responsible for
whole series of bomb attacks in Pakistan. Is it possible that two countries
are conducting a proxy war?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> No. I think that Pakistan is certainly conducting
a clandestine war, not a proxy war. But so far as India is concerned
and certainly since this Government came into office, not last year but
in 1998, there is no question of any such kind
of activity in Pakistan ever having been encouraged by India.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>Now you talked earlier about the bus to Lahore
being sent back to Kargil. Is India's hostility to Pakistan based on the
belief that General Musharraf was in charge of military during last year's
fighting?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>I think...firstly India has no hostility, as you
suggest. In fact for the people of Pakistan, the Government and the people
of India have nothing else but the greatest fellow feeling, which is what
the bus is all about. It is not hostility. Kargil
demonstrated not just a physical aggression by the armed forces of
Pakistan, following as it is did upon Lahore. Above all, it demonstrated
a transgression upon the territory of trust. The physical aggression was
vacated as it invariably would be by
any self-respecting nation. How do you regain the territory of trust?
It is not hostility, it is an attempt to slowly regain trust between the
two countries.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: W</b>ho is going to take the first step towards re-building
that trust to put the bus back from Kargil to Lahore?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>The bus incidentally continues to ply. It continues
to move between Lahore and Delhi on a daily basis. Who is going to take
the first step? I do not think it is 'wait for your first step' kind of
game.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>That is the problem, is it not?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>No, it is not. Not really. It is quite clear from
the evolution of events themselves that certain things have to be done
and Pakistan has to recognise that this compulsive hostility that it demonstrates
towards India must cease. I do not
wish to particularise it and concentrate only on the hijack to Kandhar
which is a trial for large numbers of Indians but there is need for Pakistan
to come to terms with reality.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>And the reality being...
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> The reality being that India really has no hostility
towards Pakistan, that Pakistan cannot, can simply not have a position
of perpetual confrontation against India. It will cause irreparable damage.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> Do you have hostility towards General Musharraf
?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh:</b> Of course not, not in slightest. I scarcely know
the gentleman.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> But would you be prepared to talk to the military
regime?
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>Yes. I would be prepared to talk with a duly elected
government of any country.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>So you would not be prepared to talk to General
Musharraf.
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>I did not say that. There has to be certain degree
of democratic legitimacy. This I put above all in this age and day.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>There is concern because the two countries are
declared nuclear powers. Mr. Talbott must have mentioned that to you.
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>Yes, there is a concern about that, but some of
these concerns after all, if it was simply the question of the possession
of nuclear weapons, then the manner and the restraint with which India
in the face of aggression conducted itself in
the challenge of Kargil, ought to set at least some of those doubts
at rest. India will carry on, we will continue with what we have to do
because it is not just relations with Pakistan that are our concern. To
Pakistan, that seems to be the central focus
of their entire existence.
<p><b>Stephen Cole: </b>Let us move to March and the proposed visit by
the American President. Did Mr. Talbott confirm that President Clinton
would be coming to Delhi.
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>Well, some more discussions about the visit took
place but the dates and details of the visit are yet to be finally announced
and we have to work on these details yet.
<p><b>Stephen Cole:</b> But you are hopeful that President Clinton will
come to Delhi in March.
<p><b>Jaswant Singh: </b>There is a declared intention and an invitation
from India, also from Prime Minister that President Clinton is most
welcome. The President has expressed great interest in visiting India and
we look forward to it.
<p><b>Philip Hayton, Presenter:</b> That was the Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh talking to Stephen Cole.
