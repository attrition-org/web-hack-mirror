<P><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Mr. Jaswant Singh is the man for all seasons in
the Indian Government. After the Hindu nationalist BJP assumed power one
and a half year ago, he first became the Finance Minister. But then it
was thought that he would be more effective in the post of Foreign Minister.
The 61 year old Minister who gives the impression of being moderate and
liberal, is trying to dispel the apprehensions surrounding what foreign
countries may think are the chauvinistic policies of the BJP. A defence
expert, the former Army officer, is considered to be the architect of India's
nuclear strategy. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Peter Munch</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
spoke with Mr. Jaswant Singh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: Your party is considered to be a sure winner in the
general elections. After your last election victory in 1998, you gave the
world shock therapy and projected India as a nuclear power. For what should
we be prepared this time?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: You can continue to rely on India to be a factor for stability
in Asia and in the world.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: The reality is that India is creating fear in the
world - a nuclear weapon state which is entangled in an endless conflict
over Kashmir with the nuclear power Pakistan.</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: There is no basis for such fears. We have made it clear that
our nuclear weapons are not there to be used in such conflicts. We are
suffering due to Pakistan's hostile attitude. But every time we are confronted
by aggression, we have reacted with utmost restraint. Rather than being
worried because of India, the world should display more understanding for
the challenges we face.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: What will India do with its nuclear weapons?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: they are purely defensive. No first use, no use against non-nuclear
weapon states. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: When and under what conditions will India sign the
CTBT?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: There are no conditions. After the elections, a broad political
consensus on this issue needs to be created. We have already announced
an unilateral moratorium.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: Will you sign even before Pakistan?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: We are not influenced by Pakistan or any other country in our
planning.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: Have the nuclear tests last year changed India's position
in international politics?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: It has certainly got us more strategic freedom and more autonomy.
That was also our objective.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: And what are your intentions now? A leading role in
the region, a permanent seat at the table of the nuclear powers in the
table of the nuclear powers in the UN Security Council?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: I do not think that we should link that with this. We do not
play any power games. But a country of our size, population and economic
potential would definitely have to be considered for a seat in the Security
Council.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: Isn't UN or other international mediation helpful
in the Kashmir conflict?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: No. Indians and Pakistanis speak the same language. We do not
require any interpreter. We ourselves understand - much better than any
third party - where the difficulties are.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: But the dialogue with Pakistan is deadlocked?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: We are ready for renewal. Pakistan is not. At the UN General
Assembly in New York, my colleague from Islamabad refused to hold talks.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: What do you expect from Pakistan. After the last Kashmir
adventure and the shameful retreat, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is under
enormous pressure from the Islamists. Is that a threat for India as well?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: We are naturally concerned about it. But I do not want to speculate
on what could happen there. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SZ: During the recent conflict in Kashmir, a shift in
the axis became apparent. Pakistan was reprimanded by its old ally, America.
India received support. Does this give an idea of the future?</FONT></P>

<P>Singh: I believe that in international politics, yesterday's network
of relations is not valid for the decades to come. There has to be a change
in this regard all over the world. And a very significant aspect here is
better cooperation and better understanding between the USA and India.
Complete harmony, of course, is not possible. Talks with representatives
of the American government in the recent past, have been, however, the
best we have had in the last 15 years.</P>
