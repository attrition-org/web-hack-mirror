<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>o the US, the 'bedrock'
of its policy towards nuclear India is the NPT. This has clearly been articulated
by its spokesmen. According to deputy secretary Strobe Talbott: 'We do
not, and will not, concede, even by implication, that India and Pakistan
have established themselves as nuclear weapon states under the NPT. Unless
and until they disavow nuclear weapons and accept safeguards on all their
nuclear activities, they will continue to forfeit the full recognition
and benefits that accrue to members in good standing of the NPT. This is
a crucial and immutable guideline for our policy.''</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sanctions and Demands</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Despite this articulation, India has held eight
rounds of talks and apparently has promised further discussions. This has
led to sharp divisions within India. Concerns have been heightened by the
US assertion that India has given a commitment to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by summer this year, in exchange, not for US ratification
of that Treaty, but for an end to US blockage of World Bank loans to India,
a punitive measure not even envisaged in US law. This indicates a disturbing
direction to the talks in particular, but also to Indo-US relations in
general. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">India's position has always been that as long
as there are nuclear weapons in the world, India would require these weapons
for her security, having once faced, in 1971, a direct threat from them.
What India has held to be in her long term interests has been a nuclear
weapon free world, and the elimination of all nuclear weapons within a
time-frame. What we now see, is a delinking of the CTBT from this objective,
and a quid pro quo which is not only partial but against India's long-term
interests as well. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">India has been faced with sanctions and demands
that it not only accept the US-led new world order, but embrace all its
control mechanisms -- the NPT and its offspring, the CTBT and the proposed
Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT). In order to safeguard its nuclear
option, India has faced sanctions for over three decades: the important
point is that signature of the CTBT will not remove the most important
sanctions against us. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The CTBT emerged in 1996 as a non-proliferation
tool, devoid of any disarmament element. Faced with a defective CTBT, a
national consensus emerged not to sign the treaty. It is amazing that some
of those who had opposed the CTBT most strongly, who had felt that if sanctions
were imposed, `sehna hai to sehna padega', are now arguing that, following
Pokhran II, India can now sign the treaty. Has the treaty been changed
even by one word? Does it no longer impact on India's interests, both her
own security and her commitment to nuclear disarmament?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">First and foremost, it should be recognised that
the CTBT and the proposed FMCT are not 'stand alone' treaties, but flow
directly from the NPT and are targeted at the `holdouts' to the NPT. All
non-nuclear weapon states signatories of the NPT are in any case forbidden
to test or manufacture nuclear weapons; only the five `declared nuclear
weapon states have, and continue to have that privilege. Second, the CTBT
is a partial and dangerous treaty with loopholes that allow these five
countries to continue to qualitatively improve their arsenals. During the
CTBT negotiations, there were parallel P-5 negotiations, where it was decided
what activities would be permitted to them under a CTBT. Once there was
agreement among them on this issue, the CTBT text emerged. As a non-member
of the P-5, these 'permissible activities' (such as subcritical tests)
are now open to India.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Satellite Spying</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Third, the CTBT verification regime, which was
not examined in any detail by the Indian authorities during the negotiations,
is a highly unequal and discriminatory one. The International Monitoring
System (IMS) can detect only explosive tests above a level of one kiloton,
and that too, in a non-clandestine environment. This leaves room for the
P-5 to conduct not only highly sophisticated `subcritical' tests under
Article 1 of the treaty, but underground tests at very low yields. True,
this is a loophole that can be used by other putative nuclear weapon states
as well. So, who will monitor tests between zero yield and 1,000 tonnes?
This has been catered to, in the CTBT, by NTMs-National Technical Means,
which in reality means espionage, satellite surveillance, humint etc, and
it is only the major powers that have such capabilities, and the clout
to have the products of such NTMs internationally accepted. The fact is,
that the CTBT which we did not accept as `flawed' in 1996 remains as flawed
today. And, it still does not contribute to nuclear disarmament, but undermines
moves in that direction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Becoming a party to the CTBT would be tantamount
to joining the inequitable nuclear regime we have fought so long against.
It would mean our joining the pyramidal international power structure with
the US at its apex. What does India gain by signing the CTBT? Certainly
not the lifting of sanctions on the flow of advanced and dual-use technologies.
That depends on our signing the NPT. Is that where we are headed?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Permanent Dissident</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A US official once called India a 'permanent dissident'.
This term has now been picked up by some Indians, including in the establishment,
to justify why India should join the New World Order. Had India not been
a 'permanent dissident', we would not have preserved our nuclear option,
and more important, may not have gained our independence. Today, the US
and its allies will not change the NPT to accommodate the new realities;
so, will India be signing the CTBT and joining the international 'mainstream'
as a non-nuclear state or as a state which is not recognised as a nuclear
weapon state but has nuclear weapons? We might then be told we are in violation
of the NPT and the international non-proliferation regime. Will we then
accept a &quot;rollback'' of our nuclear programme?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">India cannot and should not accept control regimes
that would be indefinite in time and would jeopardise our decision-making
autonomy. Our security interests cannot be `harmonised' with an inequitable
world order and certainly not by signing dangerous control mechanisms like
the CTBT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Just as the US will not recognise India as a nuclear
weapon state under the NPT, India cannot and should not accept that the
NPT has conferred a special status on the P-5 to retain and modernise their
nuclear arsenals indefinitely.</FONT></P>
