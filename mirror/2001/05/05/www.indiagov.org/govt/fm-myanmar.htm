<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Yangon, Feb.16: The Myanmar
Foreign Minister, U Win Aung, in an exclusive interview yesterday, provided
an insight into Indo- Myanmar relations, Yangon's perception of Sino-Indian
relations and its experience with ASEAN.&nbsp;</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Minister was very
pleased with the visit of his Indian counterpart, Mr. Jaswant Singh, and
spoke of other areas of cooperation between the two countries.&nbsp;</font></font></b><b></b>
<p><i>The following are excerpts from the interview:&nbsp;</i>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The Hindu: How would you assess the visit of the
Indian External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh, to your country?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">U Win Aung: The visit was very fruitful. I asked
the Foreign Minister, Mr. Jaswant</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">Singh, at the airport what he thought of the
visit and he said it had been very fruitful.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">Since 1981, (when) the former Prime Minister,
Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, who was Foreign Minister at the time, visited
our country and 20 years apart, now we have</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">another Foreign Minister visiting our country.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We felt it is the right moment and it is a historical
turn in exchange of visits between our two countries and it materialised
after the visit of our Vice-Chairman (of the ruling State Peace and Development
Council), Gen. Maung Aye, to India. I think that this visit.... after his
meeting with various Ministers and at my dinner and call and talks....
seven or eight Ministers together.... because I arranged that. His (Mr.
Singh's) visit was very, very short. The meetings this (February 15) morning
with our Chairman, Senior General Than Shwe, and also with Secretary- 1,
Gen. Khin Nyunt, were very fruitful and, for us, it is a very encouraging
sign that the relations between India and Myanmar are coming to a historical
turn. It is a turn we have waited for.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">We have the recent example of constructing the
road from Tamu to Kalewa to</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">Kalemyo. What are the other infrastructure projects
that have been discussed during the visit of the External Affairs Minister?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We have agreed to the construction of a bridge
in Rih, between Champai (in Mizoram) and Rih. There is a Rhi lake; it's
a heart- shaped lake. People in the area used to cross the border and from
that point onwards, we will construct some roads. We have also been undertaking
feasibility studies from Mizoram to Sittwe (Akyab port) - what we call
the Kaladan river project and Palewa. It will have the chance of providing
Mizoram with a sea outlet and also another place we are talking is Kyaukpyu
- that's a deep sea port.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">There are also projects in the field of hydroelectricity,
power projects. One in Tamanthi on the Chindwin River and another project
we are discussing is at Yeywa, near Mandalay.... we covered a lot of areas
(relating to) trade and national crime and also security-related matters
as well cooperation in information technology and</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">industrialisation projects of our country.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">On the insurgency issue in the north-east which
is of concern to India, there is</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">cooperation between the security forces of the
two countries. Do you think there can be any formal arrangement in this
area or the current arrangement is sufficient?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The current arrangement is sufficient. There are
mechanisms between the two armed forces and.... they have been cooperating
and also that there are assurances that our border should become (free)
of any insurgency problem. We will cooperate in this</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">matter.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">Your country straddles both South Asia and Southeast
Asia. You are the link between South Asia and Southeast Asia and can enjoy
the advantages of both. How do you look at this aspect?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Let us phrase it in this manner. Look at the map.
Yes, you are correct that we are right in the middle of East and West Asia
and North and South Asia. So, without us you cannot go around and it will
not be possible to go around. We are in the middle and we are a link. So,
BIMSTEC (grouping Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and;
Nepal having observer status) is one area in which we are very interested
so that we can become a link.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">There is a good link or bad link. What I mean
is that our country which is the</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">co-founder of the Non-Aligned Movement and also
co- author of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence with China,
India and Myanmar.... and a country which has consistently adhered to its
principled stand of non-alignment.... without any deviation we have been
strictly adhering to that position. That's why we have been isolated ourselves.
And, we didn't want to play in the Cold War games, we don't want our land
to be used by any powers to make any sort of hegemonic movements. That's
why we have tried to isolate ourselves in the past.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Religiously, we are a Buddhist country. We, Buddhists,
have no enemy. We don't</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">regard anybody as a potential enemy.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We want to be peaceful, we want to solve whatever
problems which might arise in a peaceful manner. That's the way of life
and way of thinking we have. I think that's why we can play a big role
in cementing from the East and West and North and South Asia.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">On the issue of democracy, it is clear that your
Government has its own perceptions. Recently, you have started some talks
with the Opposition, how do you see that process?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We, in our country, have had a lot of problems
since independence. These problems are not locally-made problems. These
problems are created from outside by our old colonial masters... in 1948-49
after independence there was a committee in London... to support the fractious
rebellions in our country. Since that time, we had been figthing among
ourselves for most of the time.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We need to stop the fighting, create peace and
stability, we need to create better</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">understanding among our own people. And love
each other. Not in a sort of</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">you-are-this you-are-that; not accusing each
other. We need to find solutions where our people of 135 national races
could live together for ever. And, we are hoping for national reconciliation.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We had in the past 14 years of Parliamentary democracy
which failed. And then</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">socialist-type of economy... for 26 years. Let
me very frankly say that that policy also failed to move our country forward.
These successive Governments might have been able to solve some problems,
but not the fundamental problems of national unity, economic development
to all corners of the country and even social problems are there - education,
health care....&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">You will be surprised, that in 1975, the road
between Yangon and Mandalay was not safe to travel. At night no traffic
at all, no trains. We have not come out if, we have graduated, we have
matured from that position right now to a more secure and more peaceful
atmosphere....&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">What we need to do is that all the political forces
or political parties or all the people to unite, to have one aim and goal
- that is a democratic nation. In the past, NLD (Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy) has been using a confrontational approach,
denouncing every move of the Government.... this confrontational attitudes
have now stopped and pressure techniques and things like that have been
abandoned.... we hope for ever.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">There is a perception that there is strategic
competition between India and China. Many Western reporters have written
about this. I would just like to get your view of this.&nbsp; The world
today is changing. From the bipolar world.... now the Eastern bloc has
collapsed.... we have to frankly say that. The unipolar world is the main
player. Now, the direction is towards (a) multipolar (world). In this process
(along) with globalisation, every country has the responsibility for mankind
to create better living conditions for its citizens.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">For instance, India with more than one billion
people has the responsibility to feed its people, to better clothe its
people, to have better shelter and better living conditions... And (the)
Chinese Government also, with 1.2 billion people, they have also to create
and work hard for the better living conditions of their own people.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We, in our country, (need to do) the same thing.
In this world, when our population of the world has crossed six billion,
we should not emphasise only on the rivalry between the powers but we should
try to have cooperation.</font></td>
