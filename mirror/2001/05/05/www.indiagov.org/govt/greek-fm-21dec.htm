<p><font color="#000000">ATHENS: Greek foreign minister since 1999 and
before that alternate minister of foreign affairs from 1996, George A Papandreou
has been instrumental in building a higher profile for his country internationally.
The son of Andreas Papandreou,&nbsp; former prime minister of Greece -
who, along with Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, was part of the Initiative of
the Six' for a global reduction of nuclear weapons - he once came to Delhi
with his father. On the eve of his first official visit to India, he spoke
with Siddharth Varadarajan about a number of international issues that
are currently close to both countries:</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is on your agenda during this visit?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Our relations have traditionally been very warm;
we must enhance these at all levels - political, economic and financial,
and also cultural. We have similar thinking in many areas, which makes
it more interesting to work together. As we move into a more globalised
economy, political issues of all regions become interconnected. Therefore,
issues in our region - the Balkans, Mediterranean, Black Sea - are all
of great interest to India. Similarly, India's role in Asia, its relations
with its neighbours, are of great interest to us. One other area which
is newer is the new technology issues, where India has manpower of a high
calibre.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">With Bush as US president, do some of the policies
that he has been espousing - on missile defence - worry you?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The whole concept of missile defence is something
which brings up a number of concerns about the possibility of the creation
of a new sense of insecurity in the world. Technological developments might
have made this ideal more feasible but the political ramifications are
not certain- whether this will create a more secure world or a sense of
fear, and escalation of armed productions on the part of other countries.
So I think there is some scepticism on these ideas in general, not only
in Greece but in Europe as well.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The US claims it must defend itself from the threat
of missile attacks from `rogue states'.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The policies of the EU (on missile defence) are
conservative. The programme could create greater tension with other countries
like Russia. We had similar experiences during the Cold War, where one
move provokes another from the other side. We wouldn't want a similar situation
now.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">New missile technology has created new fears
- they are more accurate, long range. But how you deal with it - whether
you try to create an umbrella which changes the balance of power - is an
equally crucial issue because of the possible reaction and escalation from
others. In Europe we are developing a regional security situation, of common
security rather than a `one against another' kind of concept, and this
could break this down as a result.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The US has cautioned the EU on its separate defence
initiative. Do you see EU defence plans leading to the down playing of
NATO's centrality and the reduction of US influence in Europe?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I think there will be a new complementarity. We
have stressed that this plan is not against anyone. It is to provide greater
support for initiatives that Europe can take on its own. But certainly
we are seeking the cooperation of the US and other NATO countries who may
not be in the EU. In certain areas where we have had problems in our region
- Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia, for example - one thing that has provoked
this new EU initiative is that the Europeans have been seen as inefficient
and unable to deal with crises on their own continent. Secondly, although
Greece would not have a problem with a much more rigorous form of EU defence,
today we are talking about specific tasks - peacekeeping, crisis management,
humanitarian operations. So this EU army of approximately 60,000 soldiers
would be for these types of tasks. It would be under the auspices of UN
Security Council resolutions and could be deployed in other parts of the
world as well.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In purely military terms, if there had been an
EU army in place during, say, the Kosovo crisis, would things have been
different? Would Yugoslavia still have been bombed? Also, would Greece
- which disagreed with NATO strategy - find its concerns again been put
on the side?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">We would have to go back to how decisions are
taken in NATO, but in the EU, the 15 member states have equal say on similar
operations irrespective of size. Now, you may find yourself in the majority
or minority, or sometimes alone. This happens in the EU with many countries
and then you have to make a political decision as to whether you will maintain
your position or go along with the majority. On the Kosovo war, we said
we had our reservations on the issue of bombing but we did not stop this
decision as we were the only country that had these reservations.</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">If there were a new conflict, Europe would have
the ability to make autonomous political decisions. But it would work very
closely with its allies outside, especially to use NATO assets. In future,
this concept may also&nbsp; grow into a defensive operation for Europe
itself, for defending Europe...</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">From whom? Where is the threat?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Hopefully none, but this may develop.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">There is some concern in India about US reports
of cooperation between Pakistan and Turkey on the nuclear issue. Is this
something which worries Greece?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I have seen reports and articles but have not
seen any specific information on the development of these programmes. But
as a principle, we are against nuclear&nbsp; proliferation. Secondly, we
would not like to see nuclear escalation in this region. Certainly, it
would be alarming if one of our neighbours developed this. Now that we
are in a period of trying to lower tensions with our neighbours, particularly
Turkey, it would have a very negative effect. So we would share India's
concerns on any further nuclear proliferation.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Like India and Pakistan, Greece and Turkey are
considered implacably hostile neighbours. Yet you have worked hard to improve
relations. Are you satisfied with the way Greek-Turkish relations are developing?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">In the last year, a new path has been opened.
This is a product of the desire of the peoples of both countries. This
came out very dramatically during the earthquakes which took place in Turkey
last year and then Greece. The response of people was quite moving. A political
message came out of the humanitarian response, that people want peace and
that the two governments should begin to work together more seriously.
There are still quite big problems which remain - Cyprus, for example -
but what we have decided to do is build a basis of trust slowly but surely
on issues of common interest. We signed 10 accords last year on tourism,
environment, culture, etc. That was quite a breakthrough considering it
was 14 years after accords were last signed by us. Trade has doubled in
one year, so there is a strong economic basis for good relations.&nbsp;</font>
