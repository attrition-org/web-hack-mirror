<P><B>You have been engaged in extended talks with the US since the nuclear
tests last year. How would you assess the results so far?</B></P>

<P>By first, restating the objectives from our side. They are two fold:
in the first place, to reconcile the stated US non-proliferation concerns
with India's national security objectives; secondly, and, in a broader
context, to develop greater mutual understanding so that both countries
are enabled to work together in tapping the real potential of a qualitatively
new relationship, essential in this post-Cold War environment. </P>

<P>The results of my discussions with Strobe Talbott are encouraging. There
is recognition that India shall maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent as
determined by us. There is now no longer any talk of `roll-back'. The US
also accepts that India's security concerns are not geographically limited.
Foreign policy tasks and challenges are a continuing process, therefore,
we need to consolidate these understandings across all sections that make
up the US foreign policy establishment. </P>

<P><B>Do you have a time frame for concluding this dialogue?</B></P>

<P>In the management of foreign policy, deadlines are both impractical
and unrealistic. But if we manage through objectives then the first part
is the restoration of our relationship to the pre-May, 1998 position. As
for the next, I would consider it attained when both India and the USA
engage in regular dialogue on a range of issues covering bilateral, regional
and global political and economic issues. </P>

<P><B>Can you define these issues? </B></P>

<P>Of course, I cannot draw up a total list. But, self evidently, these
would range from discussing cooperation in the field of energy, science
&amp; technology, environment, trade, taxation, economic development etc.,
to global concerns like terrorism, narcotics, non-proliferation, disarmament,
reform of multilateral institutions, expansion of UN Security Council,
regional developments in Asia- Pacific etc. Obviously, a multifaceted dialogue
of this nature can simply not imply an agreement on all, it is the density
and depth of engagement that is the criteria. </P>

<P><B>A principal item on the agenda is the CTBT and there seems to be
considerable confusion about India's stand on this issue. Where exactly
are we?</B> </P>

<P>Our stand on the CTBT has been clear. In 1996, we decided that we could
not accept the CTBT because it was not consistent with India's national
security interest. Over decades, successive governments took necessary
steps to safeguard India's nuclear option. In 1996, it was clear to all
that subscription to the CTBT at that time would have limited India's nuclear
potential at an unacceptably low level. After conducting the nuclear tests
of May, 1998, to validate and update our technology, we have ensured the
credibility of our nuclear deterrent into the foreseeable future; our scientists
are now confident of conducting sub-critical tests, also other non-explosive
R&amp;D activity necessary for the purpose. That is why, we declared a
voluntary moratorium. This, in essence, meets the basic obligations of
the CTBT. We also announced a willingness to convert this undertaking into
a de jure obligation. Clearly, this could not be done in a political vacuum.
A positive environment had to be created. In reaction, a number of countries
decided to impose restrictive economic measures on India. We have conveyed
our disappointment at these actions. That, however, does not mean that
we do not value our bilateral relationships with these countries. Our endeavour
has been to generate a better appreciation of India's security concerns.
Obviously, this is possible only through a sustained, bilateral dialogue
process. An understanding in this regard will restore our relationship
to the pre-May 1998 position. I am also optimistic that this process of
restoration will result in an acceptance of a secure, self-confident India,
thus imparting a new momentum to these ties. </P>

<P>At the same time, there is no denying that the manner in which the CTBT
was negotiated, particularly, during the last stages, left a great deal
to be desired. This led to resentment against the proposed treaty. Many
in India see it as part of a discriminatory, nuclear non-proliferation
regime. </P>

<P>The Government's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation remains unchanged.
The priority of our meeting the country's national security concerns having
been addressed, the government believes that we now need to convey reassurance
to the international community and, in this regard, desires to develop
a national consensus. The need for a consensus in any democratic society
is self-evident. I have explained this in the past to the US administration,
and they better understand this approach after their own difficulties on
this issue in their Senate. </P>

<P><B>There appears to be lack of clarity about signing and ratification.
Can you elaborate?</B></P>

<P>Three separate decisions are required of the government as part of adherence
to any international treaty: signature, ratification, and deposition of
the instrument of ratification. These decisions are taken by the Cabinet.
Each of them is a separate decision. To recall a recent example: In January,
1993, the Cabinet decided that India will become a signatory to the Chemical
Weapons Convention; the decision to ratify was taken in October, 1995,
followed by another decision to deposit the instrument of ratification
in September, 1996.</P>

<P><B>In your view, how far should India go in terms of its adherence to
the CTBT at this stage, particularly in light of the uncertainty about
the Treaty's future created by the US Senate vote?</B> </P>

<P>As I have already clarified, the process of adherence to an international
treaty is a step by step process. While India's decisions will be made
by the Indian government, there is no denying that this negative vote by
the US Senate does have a bearing on the future of this treaty. I would,
therefore, consider it natural for India to also dis-aggregate its decision.
</P>

<P><B>Is India ready to join in a moratorium on the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapon purposes?</B></P>

<P>We have, after the tests last year, announced our readiness to engage
in multilateral negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva,
for a non-discriminatory and verifiable treaty to ban future production
of fissile materials for nuclear weapon purposes. This decision was taken
after due consideration, which included an assessment of time frames for
negotiations and entry into force of an FMCT. At this stage, India cannot
accept a voluntary moratorium on production of fissile materials. Let me
add that FMCT negotiations are a complex exercise, it will be important,
therefore, as we go along, to constantly monitor the pace, direction and
content of these negotiations.</P>

<P><B>Export controls is another element of dialogue with the US. What
are the prospects of an understanding in this area?</B></P>

<P>India has remained committed to non-proliferation and maintains a highly
effective system of export controls on sensitive and dual use technologies
and equipment. We have conveyed our willingness to strengthen this further
where necessary. In this regard, an inter-ministerial expert group has
been established. I must add that we do remain greatly concerned about
the fact that certain civilian programmes in high technology areas e.g.
space etc. remain targeted. Our participation in ad hoc export control
regimes such as Nuclear Suppliers Group, MTCR etc will be on the basis
of equality. US does appreciate that India has a system of laws and an
effective institutional mechanism to implement non-proliferation related
export controls but we need to make further progress. </P>

<P><B>There is a perception in the international community that the document
prepared by the National Security Advisory Board for the National Security
Council is India's official nuclear doctrine. What is the status of this
document?</B></P>

<P>Let me correct this misperception. The National Security Advisory Board
is a group of non-official strategic experts and analysts. It was tasked
by the National Security Council to prepare a number of papers including
one on a possible 'Indian Nuclear Doctrine'. This they prepared and submitted
to the National Security Advisor, also releasing it publicly for larger
debate. That debate is now under way. It is thus not a policy document
of the Government of India.</P>

<P><B>Would you like to elaborate on what then is the essence and thinking
on India's doctrine?</B></P>

<P>The key elements of India's nuclear policy were spelt out by Prime Minister
in Parliament last December. To recapitulate briefly: </P>

<P>a) India shall maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent and shall undertake
necessary measures to ensure the credibility of it. </P>

<P>b) India has declared a moratorium on undertaking any further underground
nuclear test explosions but R&amp;D activity including computer simulation
and sub-critical tests will be conducted as necessary. </P>

<P>c) Development work on an extended range Agni missile is underway and
a successful flight test was carried out earlier this year. Additional
flight testing will be undertaken in a manner that is non-provocative,
transparent, and consistent with all established international norms and
practices. </P>

<P>d) India has declared a no-first-use doctrine. This has implicit the
principle that India shall not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon
states.</P>

<P>e) In order that our minimum deterrent be credible, we shall adopt and
maintain a deployment posture that ensures survivability of assets. Such
a posture, obviously, provides for greater safety and security.</P>

<P>f) India will not engage in any arms race. We shall not, therefore,
pursue an open-ended programme. </P>

<P>g) A civilian command and control system, with necessary safeguards,
shall cater for all possible contingencies.</P>

<P>h) India's commitment to global nuclear disarmament remains undiluted.
We will continue to work with other like minded countries and take initiatives
for moving towards a nuclear-weapon-free-world. We will also seek to negotiate
CBMs, both in the conventional and nuclear fields, with the aim of reducing
lack of trust in the region.</P>

<P><B>Many commentators find these elements inconsistent and believe that
India has embarked on a programme that will produce a nuclear arsenal larger
than that of UK or France. Do you have any comments?</B></P>

<P>I am aware of such apprehensions. These are born of the Cold War experiences,
ideology, indeed, even the clich&eacute;d phrases of those sterile years.
USA, Russia, UK, France and China - all developed their nuclear weapons
as weapons for war fighting. Most nuclear weapon powers follow doctrines
of first use, and all of them envisage tactical or sub-strategic roles
for their nuclear weapons. Indian thinking is different, principally, because
we have discarded the Cold War reference frame of nuclear war fighting.
In our view, the principle role of nuclear weapons is to deter their use
by an adversary. For this, India needs only that strategic minimum which
is credible. With the policy of 'retaliation only', survivability becomes
critical to ensure credibility. This 'minimum,' however, cannot be a fixed
physical quantification; it is a dynamic concept but firmly rooted in the
strategic environment, technological imperatives and national security
needs and the actual size, components, deployment and employment of nuclear
forces will be decided taking into account all these factors.</P>

<P>No other nuclear weapon state has conceptualized its capabilities in
such terms. India can and has done so because it does not intend to engage
in an arms race. Therefore, the question of an arsenal larger than that
of country X or Y becomes a non-question. For India the question is only
one of adequacy, that is credible and thus defines our 'minimum'.</P>

<P><B>How would you address concerns about India seeking a &quot;triad&quot;?</B></P>

<P>Let me address the issue of 'triad', not because it is part of the NSAB
paper, but because there may be genuine misperceptions. It is a known fact
that today India has nuclear capable aircraft and mobile land based nuclear
capable missiles. We have an R&amp;D programme for a naval version of Prithvi
that has been a part of the IGMDP launched in 1983. It is also a fact that
many analysts, particularly in Western countries, consider nuclear missiles
on submarines to be the most survivable nuclear asset in the scenarios
that they have thought of - first strike, second strike, war fighting and
so on. Our approach is different. It is, therefore, premature to talk of
an Indian 'triad'. R&amp;D programmes will certainly continue, aimed at
enhancing survivability and thus, credibility, but decisions on production,
deployment and employment etc will be taken on the basis of factors that
I have outlined earlier. In short, just as parity is not essential for
deterrence, neither is a triad, a pre-requisite for credibility.</P>

<P>Let me suggest that you look at the Indian nuclear deterrent as a 'triad'
based on a different set of three dimensions - a deterrent that is minimum
but credible because it is survivable and backed by effective civilian
command and control to ensure retaliation. </P>

<P><B>You appear to be emphasising survivability but will this not affect
retaliation?</B></P>

<P>No. Retaliation does not have to be instantaneous; it has to be effective
and assured. I emphasise this because effective and assured retaliation
enhances the credibility of the deterrence. Mobility and dispersal improves
survivability. Operating procedures will ensure the transition from peace
time deployment modes to a higher state of readiness when required. Our
nuclear assets are limited and consistent with no-first-use, we have ensured
that these procedures do not tempt an adversary to pre-emption but strengthen
deterrence by underlining the political resolve for effective retaliation.
</P>

<P><B>Would it be correct to deduce that India will follow different peace
time and war time deployment/postures?</B> </P>

<P>This would be a correct assessment. You know that we would like to convey
a sense of assurance in our region, also beyond so that our deployment
posture is not perceived as de-stabilising. We have rejected notions of
'launch on warning postures' that lead to maintaining hair trigger alerts,
thus increasing the risks of unauthorized launch. In fact, we have taken
an initiative in the UN General Assembly last year, calling on all nuclear
weapon states to review such postures, and move to de-alert, thus reducing
global nuclear danger. </P>

<P><B>How does this posture relate to tactical nuclear weapons?</B></P>

<P>Regarding tactical nuclear weapons, let me remind you that we do not
see nuclear weapons as weapons of war fighting. In fact, India sees them
only as strategic weapons, whose role is to deter their use by an adversary.
Civilian command and control over decisions relating to deployment and
alert levels is logical. Is there any change in India's position on elimination
of nuclear weapons or let me say, in India's approach towards this objective?</P>

<P>I would like to emphasise that there is a no dilution of India's commitment
to the objective of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free- world. We continue
to call for negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention that would prohibit
the production, development, deployment and use of all nuclear weapons
and also provide for elimination of present stockpile under international
verification. India is the only nuclear weapon state to do so. At the same
time, we also understand that nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved overnight;
it will be a step-by-step process. We approach this process in a practical
sense from two directions. On one side, we need to strengthen the norm
against nuclear weapons by multilaterally negotiated non-use, no-first-use
agreements. From a technical stand point, we need to move away from the
present hair trigger postures to a progressively de-alerted state that
will reduce the risks of accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.
It will also act as a global CBM. In both these areas, India continues
to take initiatives and our resolutions in the UN General Assembly have
been adopted with wide-spread support. </P>
