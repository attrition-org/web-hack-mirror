<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much of the State Department in Washington's
Foggy Bottom area is verboten territory. Following recent episodes involving
stolen computers and missing files, all visitors journalists included now
have to be escorted if they proceed above the second floor, which is where
officials sit. Ensconced in the South Asia bureau on the sixth floor as
its Assistant Secretary and pointman for the region, Karl Frederick Inderfurth
is guarded even without all the trappings of extra security that is sweeping
the State Department. A former journalist with ABC, he is more at ease
on the other side of the microphone. Now considered one of the key principals
of the Clinton administration's South Asia turnabout, Inderfurth spoke
to Washington correspondent <b>Chidanand Rajghatta </b>last week on the
President's trip to the region:</font></i>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is the US assessment of the President's
trip to India?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It exceeded our expectations and indeed
our hopes. We always felt it would be a successful visit, that the times
are right to move into a position of natural stronger closer relationship.
That the personalities, President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee,
are right. But the trip do go even beyond our expectations and reaffirmed
the view of many of us that it wastime to get the relationship back on
the track, time to get our quarterback on the field.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So on a scale of one to ten, how much
of US objectives were achieved and how much of India's aspirations were
met?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In terms of tone and quality, I would say
we had a perfect ten. But just because the tone and quality of exchanges
were right on the mark does not mean that the US and India have reached
an agreement on all outstanding issues. No two nations can do that no matter
how close they are. These things require more time. The President was very
open in his views here but he was open in a respectful sort of way. So
I think we have turned a new page in our relation. I think Dennis Kux will
have to change the title of his book or its sequel from Estranged Democracies
to Engaged Democracies. We cannot forget the years of estrangement so this
has made the engagement all the more well-received. As Secretary Albright
said there is something unnatural about two countries that share so many
values not being closer.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That's all atmospherics. What about
objectives on the scale?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would not want to quantify it but the
objectives were also met on this trip. We would certainly have a very high
score. There is no question thatwe are moving forward in strengthening
the relationship. The vision statement and the institutionalising of dialogue
is already beginning to show the effect even thought it has just been a
few weeks after the President's visit. We are working together on terrorism,
nuclear export regulation, economic issues, Asian security, child labour
and a whole lot of issues. All this points to what was a fundamentally
overriding objective of this trip which was to establish a broadbased multifaceted
relationship with India.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But on issues like the test ban treaty
there does not seem to be any progress. It wasn't even on the table during
the President's visit.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I don't agree that there has been no progress.
The Indian government did announce immediately after the testing a unilateral
moratorium on further testing and that was an important first step.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But all those endless rounds of talks
between Jaswant Singh and Strobe Talbott doesn't seem to be going anywhere.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think the talks have laid a foundation
for better understanding of the problem from both sides and the way we
approach the issue. We clearly desire to see India sign the CTBT. I think
our approach (of talks) shows that we are listening to what India had to
say. It has opened the process to further progress because it is not the
US lecturing to India. We also recognise that there have been interruptions
in the ability of the government to address the issue because of the elections,
the tragedy of the hijacking and so on. We will be watching what further
progress can be made.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So do you recognise the rationale of
India's nuclear deterrence?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have said very clearly that we recognise
the issue of India's defence requirements and the issue of how it will
define these requirements are India's right and sovereign decision and
nothing could be more fundamental than that. The US will not set itself
up as the judge and jury of decisions taken. We will express our views
but the fundamental rights of a sovereign nation to determine its own defence
requirements are there.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So you don't agree with India's view
that it needs a minimum nuclear deterrent but you recognise that it is
India's decision.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That's precisely right.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But you have asked India to define what
its minimum credible nuclear defence needs are.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We think that India and its national security
establishment are still in the process of how best to define its future
defence requirements. Now keep in mind that this is no different from what
every country in the world is doing whether it is with respect to conventional
or other requirements. We ourselves are in the process of defining our
nuclear deterrence because of our Start II negotiations with Russia. It
will always be helpful to have a better sense of future direction. You
often learn this in this country through Congressional hearings, through
reports issued by the Pentagon etc. It is our hope and expectation that
when India does more formally present its requirements to fulfil its minimum
credible deterrence, it will meet those standards (of public disclosure
and debate).</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Besides how can India do this in a changing
security environment.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We agree that is a problem. It is the same
problem we face. But as thePresident and all our senior officials have
said, we are hopeful that in the world that we are in today and the direction
in which we are going, it will be a world defined by fewer rather than
more nuclear weapons.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Undersecretary Tom Pickering said recently
that India should transcend Kargil and talk to Pakistan and Pakistan should
also take steps. So where exactly does the US stand on this? Who makes
the first move?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think our position is very clear on this.
We want to see a dialogue but for that dialogue to take place we believe
it would be important for steps to be taken that will generate a positive
environment. We do believe that India has recently taken some very important
steps with the release of the Kashmiri leaders. So we are watching very
closely to see if the President's message on his visit to Islamabad was
received and if the authorities will be able to take actions with respect
to the President's message on democracy, terrorism, and non-proliferation.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Do you think enough has been done on
the ground in Pakistan for talks to take place?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In terms of whether enough has been done,
that will be a determination that New Delhi will have to make. It's a dialogue
with New Delhi not with Washington.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Does the US see merit in India's case
for a permanent membership of the UN Security Council?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We recognise the case that India is making
for permanent membership based on its size, democracy, contributions to
the UN including peacekeeping. We have said for these reasons we will give
serious consideration. We believe that India can further enhance its case
for membership by moving towards the international community on issues
like non-proliferation.</font>
