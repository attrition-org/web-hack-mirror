<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Australia has attracted serious hostility in India
- from the bureaucracy, but also from the media, politicians and the general
public.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The appalling murder last month of an Australian
missionary and his children has led to a wave of sympathy for Australia.
But underlying that is long-term hostility which will cripple our relations
with India for at least five to 10 years. This is ironic, given that the
Howard Government came to office with a wish to upgrade relations with
India.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">New Delhi believes Australia kept India out of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum and intrigued against it over
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But most of all, New Delhi believes
we grossly overreacted to the nuclear tests last March. The expulsion of
an innocent Indian soldier from the Australian Defence Force Academy has
achieved mythic status within the Indian bureaucracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Says Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee:
&quot;We were rather surprised by the tune, content and vehemence of the
reaction to our nuclear test by the Government of Australia. We have, however,
noted that public opinion in Australia has taken a more balanced view&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Vajpayee is generally so soft-spoken and avuncular
that those words constitute harsh cricisism. Former prime minister Inder
Kumar Gujral is blunter, accusing Canberra of hypocrisy: &quot;I said to
Australia, you get out from under the American nuclear umbrella, then talk
to us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">BJP national president Kushabhau Thakre is even
more blunt: &quot;Australia allowed British nuclear tests in your own country
but later deplored us. Australia's attitude is not acceptable.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Washington will likely ultimately come to some
accommodation with New Delhi but Australia will suffer the adverse consequences
of taking a gratuitously vigorous position for years to come, and for no
advantage.</FONT></P>
