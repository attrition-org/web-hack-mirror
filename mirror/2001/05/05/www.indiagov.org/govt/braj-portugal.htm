<p>&nbsp;The title of my presentation contains the phrase “global security”.&nbsp;
This concept is indicative of the change in our thinking about security.&nbsp;
No longer is it possible for major countries to be able to insulate themselves
from developments taking place around them in an interconnected and interdependent
world.&nbsp; Yet this is a recent realisation.&nbsp; The end of the Cold
War, the changing nature of security, and the technology driven dynamic
of globalisation - are factors that have contributed to this realisation.&nbsp;
While countries will still have a ‘national perspective’ arising out of
their own geography and history, it is increasingly accepted that we are
now dealing with global trends and global challenges.&nbsp; Our task today
is to develop global responses.
<p>2. The Cold War ended a decade ago.&nbsp; For want of a better phrase,
the last decade is often referred to as a “post-Cold War” period, indicating
its transitory character.&nbsp; One thing is clear - the early optimism
of a peace dividend has been belied.&nbsp; Also, the adversarial bipolaity
has yet to yield to a cooperative multi-polarity.&nbsp; In the interim,
what we see is the growing preeminence of the US in political, military
and technological fields.&nbsp; This has given US, enhanced capabilities,
in the post-Cold War period, in developing coalitions where these are consistent
with US national interests.&nbsp; Russia and China have increasingly voiced
concerns at this development.&nbsp; In some European countries too, there
is a growing perception that such a preeminent position for any single
country in an increasingly globalised world does not make for lasting stability
and security.&nbsp; The impact of unsettled relations between US and Russia
and US and China has far reaching consequences.&nbsp; EU, with its own
Common Foreign and Security Policy, may find itself hard pressed to reconcile
competing demands of alliance member partners and Europe’s imperatives
of economics and geography.
<p>3. The Cold War arms control process seems to have run aground.&nbsp;
Clearly, the principles of symmetry between USA and USSR and the two military
alliances they represented, with other countries relegated to a relatively
marginal role, are no longer valid.&nbsp; Equally out of date is the Cold
War arms control objective - to reduce risks of competition and mitigate
the US-Soviet arms race.&nbsp; Today, security perspectives have diverged.&nbsp;
This has been evident from the uncertainty surrounding the future of bilateral
arms control agreements such as the ABM Treaty and the START-II as well
as multilaterally negotiated agreements like the CTBT.&nbsp; The key challenge,
therefore, today is to bring about a return to stability and predictability
in relationships among major powers.
<p>4. The threat of nuclear war between the two super powers may have receded
but conflicts abound and civilian casualties continue to increase.&nbsp;
The nature of conflict has changed.&nbsp; In the early years of the 20th
century, Imperial powers engaged in conflict for territorial expansion.&nbsp;
During the Cold War, conflicts became proxy wars supported by the two super
powers caught up in an ideological divide.&nbsp; Neither remains valid
today.&nbsp; The end of the second World War witnessed the fading away
of colonialism and economic globalisation has largely eliminated the benefits
of territorial acquisition.&nbsp; Yet, we are painfully aware of the fact
that during the last decade of the 20th century, there have been as many
as 60 conflicts, the vast majority of them described as internal conflicts,
generating casualties of nearly 5 million people, four-fifths of whom were
innocent civilians!
<p>5. It is true that the world has moved during the last century towards
democratisation.&nbsp; At the beginning of the 20th century, only six out
of the then 43 countries could have been described as democracies and that
too with limited suffrage.&nbsp; By 1980, 37 out of 121 countries were
democratic societies; today, 118 countries, accounting for 54 percent of
the global population are accepted as democracies.&nbsp; And yet, the impact
of internal conflicts is evident from the fact that the number of international
refugees has grown from less than 4 million in 1975 to more than 15 million
in 1999.
<p>6. A major reason is that the definition of security is changed.&nbsp;
It is no longer limited to military might but extends beyond to a more
comprehensive definition encompassing economic strength, internal cohesion
that enables exercise of national will and technological progress.&nbsp;
Food security, energy security, a clean environment, equality before law
and good governance form part of the notion of comprehensive security.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly, this change in the definition of security ha been driven by
globalisation.&nbsp; During the Cold War, the market place was subjected
to political and strategic imperatives; today, we witness the triumph of
capitalism which has generated a globalised economy.&nbsp; The disjunction
arises because in a globalised economy, economic geography and political
geography no longer coincide.&nbsp; Subjects considered within the domain
of national sovereignty increasingly become vulnerable to the unknowns
of a market place.&nbsp; It is important to recall that during the Cold
War period, Western societies restrained unfettered capitalism with doses
of liberalism in public interest, to prevent abuses and protect against
failures.&nbsp; Similarly, the uncritical triumphalism today also needs
to be tempered.&nbsp; Today’s challenge is greater because developing countries
do not often have the resilient institutional mechanisms that many Western
developed countries have evolved over two centuries.&nbsp; Yet, if these
countries get marginalised, it will only lead to growing tensions and instabilities.&nbsp;
Therefore, a global order has to be consciously constructed and mechanisms
found to tackle the negative consequences of social dislocation.
<p>7. What do these developments mean for a large democratic and secular
developing country like India which is not a member of any military alliance
but seeks to pursue an independent foreign policy even as it enhances its
economic engagement with the rest of the world in order to meet the rising
socio-economic aspiration of its billion strong population?
<p>8. First, these developments make it necessary for India to ensure stability
on our borders and in our extended neighbourhood - the Persian Gulf, Central
Asia, Indian Ocean region and Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Sourcing India’s energy
needs, presence of large number of Indians in Persian Gulf and Southeast
Asia, growing economic and security linkages with ASEAN, the threat of
fundamentalism in Central Asia - are evident factors that necessitate greater
Indian engagement with these regions.&nbsp; As a plural, democratic society,
India’s engagement imparts stability in its neighbourhood.&nbsp; In recent
years, India has offered increased political and economic cooperation to
its neighbours, building and strengthening structures of functional cooperation,
e.g., South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh,
India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and
the Indian Ocean Rim initiative.&nbsp; The nature of our interaction in
such organisations reflects our conviction about a comprehensive view of
regional security that goes beyond the absence of conflict towards a mutually
beneficial cooperative partnership.
<p>9. The traditional security challenges of resolving outstanding issues
with Pakistan and China remain a major preoccupation.&nbsp; India is fully
conscious of the importance of keeping the probability of an armed conflict
low, by maintaining an adequate level of defence preparedness and negotiating
and implementing appropriate confidence and security building measures.
<p>10. Relations with China are back on track, with resumption of normal
exchanges, establishment of a security dialogue and the forthcoming visit
by the President of India to Beijing as part of the commemoration of 50
years of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.&nbsp;
China now acknowledges that as two major countries of Asia, India and China
bear an important responsibility for the maintenance of regional peace
and stability.
<p>11. The Kargil conflict and subsequent developments in Pakistan, including
the military coup have prevented resumption of dialogue with Pakistan that
was envisaged in the Lahore process.&nbsp; Pakistan’s open support and
involvement in cross-border terrorism and belligerent statements reflect
its unwillingness to give up the path of military confrontation.&nbsp;
It is a sad fact that democracy in Pakistan has often been a victim of
its leader’s obsession of seeking parity with India and a military solution
to Jammu &amp; Kashmir.&nbsp; However, developments in Pakistan are not
merely a matter of concern to India because the Pakistan-Afghanistan region
today has become a global source of instability - the second largest producer
of drugs, a major proliferator of small arms and light weapons, and the
single largest gene-pool of global terrorism.
<p>12. Improvement of relations with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar
has the long term positive implication of dealing with the vexing issue
of migration of people and refugees.&nbsp; Yet, these are not only relationships
limited to boundary management but wider in scope.&nbsp; With Myanmar,
transportation in border areas has a positive impact in curbing drug trafficking
and smuggling.&nbsp; The potential for energy cooperation, particularly
with Bangladesh and Nepal, is a priority area, given the rising energy
demand generated by Indian economic growth.
<p>13. While improving relations with countries in its neighbourhood, India
has also sought to increase its level of engagement with other major countries
- USA, Russia, Japan and EU members.&nbsp; President Clinton’s recent visit
to India has laid the foundation for a closer and qualitatively different
bilateral relationship.&nbsp; The two countries have agreed tha they shall
be partners in peace with a common interest and complementary responsibility
for ensuring regional and international security.&nbsp; The relationship
with Russia has been a long-standing strategic relationship that has withstood
the turbulence of the last ten years.&nbsp; Both countries share an identity
of views on a wide range of issues and maintain a tradition of high level
exchanges and dialogues.&nbsp; Concerns generated in Japan after India’s
nuclear tests in May, 1998, have been addressed during a recent visit by
the Indian Foreign Minister.&nbsp; This has been followed by the first
ever visit of an Indian Defence Minister to Japan, reflecting the growing
realisation that both countries need to develop this aspect of their bilateral
relationship.&nbsp; India’s increasing interaction with the EU is reflected
in the decision to schedule the India-EU Summit later this year.
<p>14. Let me dwell briefly on the nuclear issue.&nbsp; The tests undertaken
by India in May, 1998, were in response to the failure of international
non-proliferation regime in addressing India’s security concerns.&nbsp;
Nuclear proliferation in our neighbourhood, including by NPT members, was
well established, with missile proliferation adding a more dangerous dimension.&nbsp;
Yet, it should be clear to any observer that India’s decision was marked
by restraint and a willingness to cooprate with the international non-proliferation
regimes.&nbsp; This approach, I would say, has now been acknowledged and
has enabled us to address satisfactorily many of the misperceptions and
apprehensions that were voiced immediately following the tests.&nbsp; We
have emphasised our requirement of maintaining a minimum credible deterrent
and refraining from being drawn into an arms race or a search for parity.&nbsp;
A policy of no-first-use is entirely consistent with the role of a deterrent
for which Indian nuclear weapons and deployment policy has been designed.&nbsp;
At the same time, India’s commitment to global nuclear disarmament remains
undiluted.&nbsp; The old arms control percepts that I mentioned earlier,
which also underline the NPT, have to give way to new equations if multilaterally
negotiated arms control has to succeed.&nbsp; This is as relevant in dealing
with proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles as at the
other end of the spectrum, in dealing with small arms and light weapons
proliferation.
<p>15. The Indian perspective is, therefore, not dissimilar from the European
perspective because it is rooted in sustaining plurality through engagement.&nbsp;
In India, we are seeking a society built upon allegiance to constitutional
and republican principles for only such a society can celebrate the multi-religious,
multi-ethnic, multi-lingual idea that India respresents.&nbsp; There is
a parallel in this with European efforts to build a new set of European
institutions.&nbsp; In both ventures, we are redefining the system of nation-state
that was consecrated on this continent in 1648 with its notions of absolute
sovereignty but people forget that this concept originated in an era when
democracy did not exist.&nbsp; Democratic pluralism requires the shift
from narrow territorial or ethnic nationalisms to a broader civic nationalism.&nbsp;
The threat to such an exercise, wheether in India or in Europe, comes from
one source - intolerance and extremism; whether fired by racism or religious
fundamentalism.&nbsp; In our neighbourhood, we have seen it take its toll
on democracy and human security in Pakistan; in your backyard, you have
witnessed the tragic disintegration of Yugoslavia.&nbsp; These phenomenon
run counter to the systemic of globalisation; they seek to divide while
globalisation seeks to join.
<p>16. Today’s globalisation is qualitatively different.&nbsp; We know
of the globalisation before 1914, but that era rested on a political structure
of imperialism.&nbsp; In the inter-war period, people realised how destructive
it was for countries to turn their backs on economic interdependence.&nbsp;
In 1945, political leaders once again chose the path of openness and cooperation.&nbsp;
The post-World War II system of multilateralism has made it possible for
economic globalisation to emerge once the Cold War was over; globalisation
has progressively rendered its designs antiquated.&nbsp; The&nbsp; UN Secretary
General notes pithily that “our post-war institutions were built for an
international world, but we now live in a global world”.&nbsp; One response
has been the growth of regional multilateralism; another is the growing
linkages of civil society networks cutting across boundaries.&nbsp; Yet,
in a collective sense, we still need to define an organising principle.
<p>17. It is clear that we need a new kind of cooperation, a cooperation
not based exclusively on alignment of national interests, a cooperation
which while not violating national sovereignty, promotes a shared responsibility
for globally managing the new threats to global security.&nbsp; Such a
cooperative venture requires both greater participation and greater accountability.
It requires greater engagement, not only when it suits national interests,
but in an unceasing manner for that is the dynamic of globalisation.&nbsp;
Plural states and states based on principles of civic nationalism are natural
partners and allies in such a venture for their societies are nurtured
on traditions of openness and transparency.&nbsp; In sum, the organising
principle for a globalised world in dealing with security is evidently
the “Concert of Open Societies”.
