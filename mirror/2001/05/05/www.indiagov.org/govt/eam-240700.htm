<b><tt><font color="#6262FF"><font size=+2>Diplomat Minister&nbsp;</font></font></tt></b>
<p><tt>The Vajpayee government's perception of India as a leading player
on the world stage may well account for some of the recent shifts in foreign
policy. In the aftermath of Pokhran, Kargil, Bill Clinton's visit, the
missions to Israel, the India factor in the Sri Lankan conflict and the
freeing of Indian peace-keeping troops in Sierra Leone, there is a heightened
sense of diplomatic activism in the ministry of external affairs. Foreign
Minister Jaswant Singh is especially conscious of New Delhi's higher international
visibility.&nbsp;</tt>
<p><b><font color="#990000">Is it not true that the recent visits of you
and the home minister to Israel have impacted adversely on traditional
ties with Arab countries?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>India's relations with any one country is not at the cost of another,
the visits of the home minister, foreign minister and a state chief minister
around the same time is purely coincidental. You refer to Israel but not
to my visit to Gaza. I am the first foreign minister to visit Gaza after
Nehru did as prime minister. The first person I met on this trip was Yasser
Arafat, with whom I discussed all aspects of the West Asian peace talks.
Our ties with Israel are not security oriented, but form a full diplomatic
relationship, covering all aspects of bilateral cooperation, including
software.&nbsp;
<p>I do not see any adverse impact in our relations with Arab countries,
as you seem to suggest. We have an excellent rapport with them and the
recent visits of the foreign ministers of Iran, Libya and Oman are there
for all to see.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">How do you view the Sri Lankan government's
devolution proposals that have been rejected by the Tamil parties?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>We are very mindful of the sovereign rights of Sri Lanka. We do not
like to assume that we have a right to transgress their sovereignty. We
continue to have a very real interest in the earliest possible restoration
of lasting peace and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Lasting peace
can return only through political dialogue leading to a solution in which
all the people are able to meet their aspirations.&nbsp;
<p>The India-Sri Lanka accord and the devolution package decided thereafter
is one aspect. The Sri Lankan government came up with another proposal
in 1995. We are awaiting presentation of the final devolution package to
the Sri Lankan parliament. I am informed that the various political parties
are going to be consulted. It is our hope that maximum consensus would
be achieved and that all Tamil parties will be consulted. We laud the initiative
of Chandrika Kumaratunga. It is the first time ever that the Sri Lankan
parliament would be considering such a package. The process must be carried
forward to the satisfaction of all.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">You had said at one stage that the Norwegian
formula will not work. Are you still sceptical about it?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>I was sceptical at one stage when there was a flare-up in hostilities.
Norway is in constant touch with us and consults us regularly. We provide
them with whatever advice we consider necessary. The Norwegian effort needs
India's support and encouragement.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">On Pakistan, there may be sections opposed
to talks at higher political levels. But as nuclear neighbours, should
we not keep communication channels open?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>I don't think we have to communicate only because we possess nuclear
weapons. Your question suggests that no communication channels are open.
Well, let me say this, that the director-generals of military operations
on both sides are in constant touch with each other. A number of confidence
building measures (CBM) related to the nuclear issue are already in position.
When we advocate cessation of cross border-terrorism across the Line of
Control (LoC), it is not merely in the interest of creating an environment
for dialogue; we are also underlining that the LoC, which is born of a
treaty -- the Shimla Agreement of 1972 -- is after all a very major CBM.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">Even after your 12 rounds of talks with Strobe
Talbott, the US sanctions remain. Why?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>The imposition of sanctions by the US, though born of the compulsions
of their domestic legislation, is unacceptable.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">Will the US Nuclear Missile Defence programme
unleash a new arms race and set back moves for disarmament? And given China's
decision to increase its missile stockpile, is there re-thinking in New
Delhi?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>We have consistently held a view that opposes the militarisation of
outer space. The NMD will adversely influence the larger movement towards
disarmament of which India is a staunch advocate. We believe that technological
superiority will result in a reaction in other parts of the world, thus
reviving the possibility of yet another, and newer, arms race. We cannot
support this development.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">Does this mean that the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty is now dead?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>On the CTBT, not withstanding the US senate's veto, India has pursued
a consistent policy and we will continue to do so. This is because our
decisions are made in New Delhi, not elsewhere. On the decision to sign
the CTBT the government is attempting to work towards a political consensus
on the issue.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">How far have you progressed in India's quest
for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>It is not a quest, it is India's rightful due.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">How is India preparing to cope with the emerging
instruments of foreign policy, such as energy? When do you see the gas
pipeline to India from Iran via Pakistan taking shape?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>Let us not see it in the context of Pakistan but in the larger context
of energy security. We are in touch with not only Iran but several other
countries, from Nigeria to Indonesia, Australia, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
Let us not forget Bhutan and Nepal that are vast reservoirs of hydro-electric
energy.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">You have not mentioned the proposed gas pipeline
through Pakistan?&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>It would be a mistake to take a uni-directional view. The pipeline project
is a bilateral matter between India and Iran. A working group is addressing
all aspects of the issue.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#990000">You must be relieved that the trauma of our
troops in Sierra Leone is over. What has this mission accomplished?&nbsp;</font></b><font color="#CC0000"></font>
<p>This is not the first mission in Africa. Our presence has been there
in the past too, in Congo, Namibia, Somalia and now Sierra Leone. We have
no strategic interest in Sierra Leone. But we have a commitment. The Indian
peace-keepers have given an exceptional account of professionalism and
relating to citizens of that country. I consider that the management of
the situation in Sierra Leone was one of the most outstanding examples
of a joint diplomatic-military exercise in which as a team the ministry
of external affairs and the ministry of defence addressed themselves to
one of the most trying and challenging situations that they have ever faced.&nbsp;</td>
