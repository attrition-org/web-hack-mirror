<font color="#000099">Hanoi: <i>The following are the answers by the Vietnamese
Prime Minister, Mr. Phan Van Khai, to questions submitted to him .</i></font><font color="#FF0000"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How would you describe the current status of Vietnam-India
relations?</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Phan Van Khai:</font> <font color="#3333FF">Vietnam
and India have long entertained traditional, close and</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">&nbsp;reliable relations and multi-faceted cooperation.
These relations are now continuing to develop well for the benefit of our
two peoples and in the interest of peace, stability, cooperation and development
in the region. Since our two countries gained independence, the late President,
Ho Chi Minh, and the late Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, contributed
a lot to build and cultivate close ties between the two countries. In recent
years, bilateral relations have increasingly developed at various levels
and in several fields - political, cultural, scientific, technical, security
and defence. High-level visits between the two countries of which the most
recent are those paid by the President, Mr. Tran Duc Luong, to India in
December 1999 and the Prime Minister, Mr. Vajpayee to Vietnam now have
contributed to consolidating and strengthening friendly relationship and
multi-faceted cooperation. The two Governments have set up a mechanism
aimed at coordinating bilateral cooperation like the Inter-governmental
Committee for Economic, Cultural and Scientific-Technical Cooperation and
the Joint Working Group on IT cooperation and others. All this have helped
increase the efficiency of our relations.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What are the areas in which Vietnam and India
can cooperate further?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Currently, the two countries are making efforts
to promote economics, trade, finance, credit, education-training, science-
technology, agriculture, forestry and fishery. These relations have proven
to be highly effective in promoting economic development and developing
human resources for Vietnam. In the current regional and international
situation, we wish to see the further strengthening of cooperation between
the two countries. We believe that it is necessary to find effective measures
to promote the current level and scope of cooperation and while moving
to the areas that Vietnam and India can further cooperate like education
and training, information technology, trade and economics, etc.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In November, Vietnam and India were party to the
launch of the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation initiative. How do you view this?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The Inaugural Ministerial Meeting on Ganga Mekong
Cooperation took place in</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">Vientiane at the initiative of India and Southeast
Asian countries in November last.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">Ministers from six countries agreed on the steps
to be taken to promote and increase the efficiency of multi-faceted cooperation.
This has contributed to enhancing solidarity between the six participating
countries and accelerating the implementation of the hunger elimination
and poverty reduction programme in Vietnam. The Ganga-Mekong Cooperation
will make an active contribution to the implementation of cooperative programmes
and projects in the Mekong basin and thereby to the region's sustainable
development. Among the areas of cooperation agreed upon recently, tourism,
identified as a priority at the meeting, holds much potential for fast
implementation. Vietnam's competent agencies and bodies are now actively
preparing for the exchange of the most feasible cooperative projects and
programmes with other countries concerned. Vietnam will also make efforts
to host the 2001 Ministerial Meeting on Ganga-Mekong Cooperation.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">What role do you foresee for India in the Asia-Pacific
region?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">As a big country in the region, India has an increasingly
important role and position in the region and the world. India has been
consistently following a foreign policy of independence, peace, and non-
alignment both in the past and at present. India has made efforts to strengthen
its relations with neighbouring and regional countries, contributed actively
to the Non-Aligned Movement, promoted the South-South cooperation and safeguarded
the legitimate interests of developing countries at international fora.
India has recorded important achievements in the course of reform and economic
development and thus enhanced people's living standards. This will surely
help enhance India's standing on the international arena, especially in
the Asia-Pacific region.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What are the possibilities of cooperation in the
field of information technology between the two countries?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Though new, information technology is a very important
area of cooperation and a central component of Vietnam-India relations.
At the ninth meeting of the Vietnam-India Inter-governmental Committee
for Economic, Cultural and Scientific-technical Cooperation, held in New
Delhi in 1999, the two Governments agreed to the establishment of the Joint
Working Group on Information Technology in order to materialise potential
in this area. The Vietnamese FPT Company has already set up its branch
in India and entered into joint venture with APTECH to open training centers
for Vietnamese IT experts. These companies have operated effectively. The
Indian Government has agreed to provide soft credits to Vietnam to assist
the latter in establishing training centres and developing computer software.
It is our hope that early implementation of these projects in Vietnam will
help strong IT development in Vietnam and constitute a new bright spot
in our bilateral cooperation picture.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">India is already a dialogue partner of ASEAN.
Do you see any greater formal engagement between ASEAN and India in the
coming months and years?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The foundation of ASEAN-India cooperation dates
back to the 1980s and India became a full dialogue partner of ASEAN in
1995. Ever since, India has made great efforts and active contribution
to many fora such as ARF, PMC, etc. Those activities of India, together
with the endeavours of other dialogue partners, have enhanced peace, stability,
cooperation and development in the region. India's economic and trade relations
with ASEAN are also in the increase; with two-way trade reaching US$7 billion
in 1999. It is, however, still modest, accounting for less than one per
cent of ASEAN's total trade value. In the near future, we need to make
greater efforts in promoting our economic cooperation, and try to seek
ways and means to expand trade and investment, science and technology,
etc. On the basis of the priorities set forth in the Hanoi Plan of Action,
we should build a more dynamic and effective ASEAN-India relationship.
We support improved relations between India and ASEAN in the future.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In bilateral trade, Vietnam faces an adverse trade
balance. What specific measures can be taken by India to improve the balance
of trade<i>?</i></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Recently, two way trade between Vietnam and India
has kept increasing, and currently amounts to around US$ 160 to 170 millions
a year. However, this has not been commensurating with the vast potentials
of each country as well as with our fine political relations. In fact,
Vietnam's trade with India is in deficit. There are a variety of reasons
for this, yet, the most important one is the similarity in their exports,
as well as the lack of understanding of each other's market and business
environment. In an effort to improve the balance of trade, at the tenth
meeting of the Joint Commission on Economic, Cultural, Scientific and Technological
Cooperation in Hanoi last November, the two Governments agreed to consider
the diversification of Vietnam's exports to India, enable businesses of
each country to study the other's market and business environment, streamline
unnecessary and cumbersome administrative procedures, etc. We hope that
India will come up with a more appropriate tariff regime to encourage Indian
businesses import Vietnamese goods, especially crude oil, coal, ceramics,
handicrafts, construction materials, etc. Besides efforts by our two Governments,
businesses of the two countries should be more active in exploiting on
our vast business potentials.</font>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vietnam and India have been firm friends during
the anti- colonial struggle. What new challenges will define this relationship
in coming years?</font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The world and regional situation have been witnessing
fast and profound development. The globalisation process is an inevitable
trend which brings about both positive and negative impacts to all countries
in the world. In this context, India, Vietnam as well as other developing
countries enjoy various opportunities for development, but, at the same
time, have to face many challenges in the security, political, economic
and cultural areas. In the economic field, the threat of lagging behind
presents the biggest challenge to us. We both want a peaceful and stable
environment in the region as well as the world which serves as a precondition
for us to focus on national development. We, therefore, should work closely
with each other in coping with those challenges, further consolidate and
develop our fine traditional relationship, fully exploit every potential
for cooperation and advance forward. Recently, the two countries have made
active contribution to the South-South cooperation, made the voices of
developing countries heard more loudly and defended their legitimate interests
at international fora. Vietnam and India need to work closer toward building
a peaceful and stable regional and international environment without causing
detriment to any third party.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">On the occasion of the new year, through TheHindu,
allow me to convey my best</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">wishes to the Indian people; May the traditional
relationship of mutual attachment, trust and multi-faceted cooperation
between Vietnam and India be ever developed.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
