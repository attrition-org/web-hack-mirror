<p><i><tt>Close on the heels of British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's
visit, India will play host to Home Secretary Jack Straw. The issues stay
the same -- counter terrorism, drug trafficking, immigration, and the release
of Peter Bleach -- but this time round, India hopes for a response that
will push Indo-British ties into a more meaningful realm...</tt></i>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>India and Britain have come closer
in recent years. What are the areas of co-operation that shape this relationship?</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>INDIA</b> and Britain are natural partners
and there is a mutual desire to see more co-operation. There are many areas
of international convergence such as terrorism, drug trafficking, UN reforms
and the growth of bilateral trade that has been the backbone of our relationship.
In the first five months, British exports to India have increased by 44
per cent. Investment is growing at both ends. We have also embarked on
attracting small and medium British firms to invest in India.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>There have been several high-level
visits to India from Britain. Your Deputy Prime Minister was here besides
some important secretaries, and now Home Secretary Jack Straw is arriving
here on September 4. What is the agenda for Straw's visit?</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>THE </b>visit by British Home Secretary Jack
Straw is the first by a British Home Secretary in many years. It will focus
on areas such as our co-operation in counter-terrorism. We have been listening
to what the Indian government has been saying for years on obstacles in
doing business with UK. He will also try to address the issue of immigration
and other related problems. There are more than one million people of Indian
origin in UK who are contributing immensely. He will go to the heartland
of one of the great Indian communities, in Amritsar.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>Will the British government raise
the issue of the release of Peter Bleach in the Purulia arms drop case?&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>THE</b> subject of British national Peter Bleach
will certainly come up during the visit of Home Secretary Jack Straw. I
cannot prejudge what he will say, but the issue has caused concern in Britain
and has been raised in the Parliament and the British media.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>There have been a spate of incidents
of foreign tourists being killed in Himachal Pradesh, and some British
nationals have gone missing as well. Do these incidents concern you?&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>OBVIOUSLY</b>, we are concerned about the fate
of British tourists or tourists of other countries. We have already issued
a travel advisory to tourists about travelling alone in Himachal Pradesh
and have advised them to travel in groups and take experienced guides along.
I am yet to raise the issue with the Ministry of External Affairs, but
I don't know if this will come up during talks with Straw.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>There is some concern in India
over the resumption of the sale of military hardware to Pakistan. Is it
the beginning of business as usual with Pakistan?&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>THIS</b> is not business as usual with Pakistan.
We continue to calibrate our relationship with Pakistan according to steps
taken by the Commonwealth. We will continue to work for an early restoration
of a civilian democratic government in Pakistan. The military equipment
in question comprised minor spare parts related to radar and naval equipment.
We refused Pakistan licensing of other military hardware that may have
been used for external or internal aggression.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>What is the British government's
stand on Kashmir?&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>THE</b> Kashmir dispute cannot be solved through
violence...We thoroughly welcomed the Indian government's intiative to
have talks with the Hizbul Mujahideen. It was a very important step in
the right direction, but at some stage, India and Pakistan need to talk.
There are two ingredients here: one is talks and other, restraint. And
the killings of innocents must end.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>Are you endorsing the Indian
government's position that cross-border terrorism should end before resumption
of a dialogue wih Pakistan?&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>WE</b> have made it clear both publicly and
privately that Pakistan has to first stop cross-border terrorism.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>India and Britain have been concerned
with developments in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime is promoting
the illegal drug trade to finance its activities.&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>IT</b> is a very big problem for both of us,
and one of the important items on the agenda during Jack Straw's visit
will be to intensify our consultations on the Taliban. More than 90 per
cent of heroin on the streets of UK comes from Afghanistan. We are working
with countries like India so that this nexus can be broken.&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font color="#465760"><font size=-1>Britian seems to be thinking
beyond the CTBT. Are you willing to move ahead independent of India's position
on the issue?&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#465760"><b>CTBT</b> is still on our agenda. We are still
very concerned about the need for real measures towards nuclear disarmament.
Both India and the UK wish to see global nuclear disarmament. But we will
continue to urge the Indian government to build a positive national consensus
on signing the CTBT.</font>
