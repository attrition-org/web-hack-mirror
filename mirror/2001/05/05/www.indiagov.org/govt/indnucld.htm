<P>1.1. The use of nuclear weapons in particular as well as other weapons
of mass destruction constitutes the gravest threat to humanity and to peace
and stability in the international system. Unlike the other two categories
of weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical weapons which have
been outlawed by international treaties, nuclear weapons remain instruments
for national and collective security, the possession of which on a selective
basis has been sought to be legitimised through permanent extension of
the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May 1995. Nuclear weapon
states have asserted that they will continue to rely on nuclear weapons
with some of them adopting policies to use them even in a non-nuclear context.
These developments amount to virtual abandonment of nuclear disarmament.
This is a serious setback to the struggle of the international community
to abolish weapons of mass destruction.</P>

<P>1.2. India's primary objective is to achieve economic, political, social,
scientific and technological development within a peaceful and democratic
framework. This requires an environment of durable peace and insurance
against potential risks to peace and stability. It will be India's endeavour
to proceed towards this overall objective in cooperation with the global
democratic trends and to play a constructive role in advancing the international
system toward a just, peaceful and equitable order.</P>

<P>1.3. Autonomy of decision making in the developmental process and in
strategic matters is an inalienable democratic right of the Indian people.
India will strenuously guard this right in a world where nuclear weapons
for a select few are sought to be legitimised for an indefinite future,
and where there is growing complexity and frequency in the use of force
for political purposes.</P>

<P>1.4. India's security is an integral component of its development process.
India continuously aims at promoting an ever-expanding area of peace and
stability around it so that developmental priorities can be pursued without
disruption.</P>

<P>1.5. However, the very existence of offensive doctrine pertaining to
the first use of nuclear weapons and the insistence of some nuclear weapons
states on the legitimacy of their use even against non-nuclear weapon countries
constitute a threat to peace, stability and sovereignty of states.</P>

<P>1.6. This document outlines the broad principles for the development,
deployment and employment of India's nuclear forces. Details of policy
and strategy concerning force structures, deployment and employment of
nuclear forces will flow from this framework and will be laid down separately
and kept under constant review.</P>

<P><A NAME="obj"></A>2. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Objectives</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>2.1. In the absence of global nuclear disarmament India's strategic
interests require effective, credible nuclear deterrence and adequate retaliatory
capability should deterrence fail. This is consistent with the UN Charter,
which sanctions the right of self-defence.</P>

<P>2.2. The requirements of deterrence should be carefully weighed in the
design of Indian nuclear forces and in the strategy to provide for a level
of capability consistent with maximum credibility, survivability, effectiveness,
safety and security.</P>

<P>2.3. India shall pursue a doctrine of credible minimum nuclear deterrence.
In this policy of &quot;retaliation only&quot;, the survivability of our
arsenal is critical. This is a dynamic concept related to the strategic
environment, technological imperatives and the needs of national security.
The actual size components, deployment and employment of nuclear forces
will be decided in the light of these factors. India's peacetime posture
aims at convincing any potential aggressor that :</P>

<P>(a) any threat of use of nuclear weapons against India shall invoke
measures to counter the threat: and (b) any nuclear attack on India and
its forces shall result in punitive retaliation with nuclear weapons to
inflict damage unacceptable to the aggressor.</P>

<P>2.4. The fundamental purpose of Indian nuclear weapons is to deter the
use and threat of use of nuclear weapons by any State or entity against
India and its forces. India will not be the first to initiate a nuclear
strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail.</P>

<P>2.5. India will not resort to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
against States which do not possess nuclear weapons, or are not aligned
with nuclear weapon powers.</P>

<P>2.6. <B>Deterrence requires that India maintain</B>:</P>

<P>(a) Sufficient, survivable and operationally prepared nuclear forces,</P>

<P>(b) a robust command and control system, </P>

<P>(c) effective intelligence and early warning capabilities, and </P>

<P>(d) comprehensive planning and training for operations in line with
the strategy, and</P>

<P>(e) the will to employ nuclear forces and weapons</P>

<P>2.7. Highly effective conventional military capabilities shall be maintained
to raise the threshold of outbreak both of conventional military conflict
as well as that of threat or use of nuclear weapons.</P>

<P><A NAME="nucl"></A>3. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Nuclear Forces</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>3.1. India's nuclear forces will be effective, enduring, diverse, flexible,
and responsive to the requirements in accordance with the concept of credible
minimum deterrence. These forces will be based on a triad of aircraft,
mobile land-based missiles and sea-based assets in keeping with the objectives
outlined above. Survivability of the forces will be enhanced by a combination
of multiple redundant systems, mobility, dispersion and deception.</P>

<P>3.2. The doctrine envisages assured capability to shift from peacetime
deployment to fully employable forces in the shortest possible time, and
the ability to retaliate effectively even in a case of significant degradation
by hostile strikes.</P>

<P><A NAME="cred"></A>4. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Credibility
and Survivability</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>The following principles are central to India's nuclear deterrent:</P>

<P>4.1. <B>Credibility</B>: Any adversary must know that India can and
will retaliate with sufficient nuclear weapons to inflict destruction and
punishment that the aggressor will find unacceptable if nuclear weapons
are used against India and its forces.</P>

<P>4.2. <B>Effectiveness</B>: The efficacy of India's nuclear deterrent
be maximised through synergy among all elements involving reliability,
timeliness, accuracy and weight of the attack.</P>

<P>4.3 <B>Survivability</B>:</P>

<P>(i) India's nuclear forces and their command and control shall be organised
for very high survivability against surprise attacks and for rapid punitive
response. They shall be designed and deployed to ensure survival against
a first strike and to endure repetitive attrition attempts with adequate
retaliatory capabilities for a punishing strike which would be unacceptable
to the aggressor.</P>

<P>(ii) Procedures for the continuity of nuclear command and control shall
ensure a continuing capability to effectively employ nuclear weapons.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#B6764B">^</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1> <A HREF="#top">top</A></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="comm"></A>5. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Command and
Control</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>5.1. Nuclear weapons shall be tightly controlled and released for use
at the highest political level. The authority to release nuclear weapons
for use resides in the person of the Prime Minister of India, or the designated
successor(s).</P>

<P>5.2. An effective and survivable command and control system with requisite
flexibility and responsiveness shall be in place. An integrated operational
plan, or a series of sequential plans, predicated on strategic objectives
and a targetting policy shall form part of the system.</P>

<P>5.3. For effective employment the unity of command and control of nuclear
forces including dual capable delivery systems shall be ensured.</P>

<P>5.4. The survivability of the nuclear arsenal and effective command,
control, communications, computing, intelligence and information (C412)
systems shall be assured.</P>

<P>5.5. The Indian defence forces shall be in a position to, execute operations
in an NBC environment with minimal degradation.</P>

<P>5.6. Space based and other assets shall be created to provide early
warning, communications, damage/detonation assessment.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#B6764B">^</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1> <A HREF="#top">top</A></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="sec"></A>6. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Security and
Safety</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>6.1. <B>Security</B>: Extraordinary precautions shall be taken to ensure
that nuclear weapons, their manufacture, transportation and storage are
fully guarded against possible theft, loss, sabotage, damage or unauthorised
access or use.</P>

<P>6.2. <B>Safety </B>is an absolute requirement and tamper proof procedures
and systems shall be instituted to ensure that unauthorised or inadvertent
activation/use of nuclear weapons does not take place and risks of accident
are avoided.</P>

<P>6.3. <B>Disaster control</B>: India shall develop an appropriate disaster
control system capable of handling the unique requirements of potential
incidents involving nuclear weapons and materials.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#B6764B">^</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1> <A HREF="#top">top</A></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="rd"></A>7. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Research and
Development</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>7.1. India should step up efforts in research and development to keep
up with technological advances in this field.</P>

<P>7.2. While India is committed to maintain the deployment of a deterrent
which is both minimum and credible, it will not accept any restraints on
building its R&amp;D capability.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#B6764B">^</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1> <A HREF="#top">top</A></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="disarm"></A>8. <FONT COLOR="#C40000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Disarmament
and Arms Control</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>8.1. Global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament is
a national security objective. India shall continue its efforts to achieve
the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world at an early date.</P>

<P>8.2. Since no-first use of nuclear weapons is India's basic commitment,
every effort shall be made to persuade other States possessing nuclear
weapons to join an international treaty banning first use.</P>

<P>8.3. Having provided unqualified negative security assurances, India
shall work for internationally binding unconditional negative security
assurances by nuclear weapon states to non-nuclear weapon states.</P>

<P>8.4. Nuclear arms control measures shall be sought as part of national
security policy to reduce potential threats and to protect our own capability
and its effectiveness.</P>

<P>8.5. In view of the very high destructive potential of nuclear weapons,
appropriate nuclear risk reduction and confidence building measures shall
be sought, negotiated and instituted.</P>
