9 Feb, 1999</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Jaswant Singh, India's foreign minister, almost
shudders with distaste at the thought. He wants nothing so cheap as &quot;a
deal&quot; with the US on the lifting of economic sanctions imposed as
a result of India's nuclear test last May.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Instead, he says he is aiming for acceptance by
Washington of India's claim to be a responsible nuclear power and its earnest
desire not to get in the way of global non-proliferation efforts. Thereafter
it is up to the US to lift the sanctions if it so wishes, but the hope
remains that Washington will then enter a new era of close relations with
the world's largest democracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Slight and soft-spoken, his physical presence
masks a steely determination and the confidence of a well thoughtout position.
It is difficult to imagine him losing his temper as he knots his bushy
eyebrows together in patient search of the right formulation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But his even temper must make some of the more
raucous elements of the US Congress gnash their teeth in frustrated fury.
He is not moved by their desire to punish India for last year's tests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Diplomats say they now expect Mr. Singh's approach
to win the day. Both sides know the risk of striking a definitive deal
which could be torn apart by political critics at home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Instead the effort now look slikely to be incremental
with a gradual elimination of differences leading ultimately to a visit
to the region by President Clinton, the first by a US President since Jimmy
Carter in 1976. A start, some believe, could come quite soon with the lifting
of restrictions on World Bank lending.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This is not to say that India is happy with the
US tendency to set standards for others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Prescriptive statements telling India to
do this, that and the other are counter-productive,&quot; he says. &quot;We
as India arrive at our commitments as national commitments.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What has secured progress in the bilateral talks,
is Washington's understanding of this view, he says, rather than any trade-offs
involving shifts in intrinsic positions. India continues to argue that
its posture on nuclear deployment will be passive - minimum deterrent,
no arms trade, no first use, no use against non-nuclear states - and that
it has an &quot;impeccable&quot; record on export controls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is willing to sign up to an enforceable treaty
on fissile material production, which Mr. Singh argues is more effective
that a non-verifiable unilateral declaration of intent to limit production.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But it is not prepared to abandon its missile
programme, which does not go beyond the development of an advanced Agni
medium-range missile, and it continues to believe that third party involvement
in its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir is counter-productive and destabilising.
&quot;It would be a negative development if Pakistan were permitted to
ride into the valley of Kashmir piggy-back on non-proliferation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When the US chooses to lift sanctions is a matter
for it to decide, he says. But he is encouraged by Washington's evident
desire for a better relationship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">That said, Mr. Singh admits to an acute awareness
of the challenge to India's own diplomacy posed by the tests. As an energy
poor country, it needs to collaborate with others in the civilian nuclear
field. The ability to reassure on the proliferation front is thus vitally
important, especially since India - as a declared but not recognised nuclear
state - cannot be part of the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which governs
exchanges of technology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;An answer has to be found,&quot; Mr. Singh
says. &quot;The NPT is a no-entry area. We have to work our way around
that difficulty.&quot;</FONT></P>
