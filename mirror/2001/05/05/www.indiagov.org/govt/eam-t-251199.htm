<p><b>TIME</b>: How has the coup in Pakistan affected relations with India?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: India's dealings with Pakistan have always been governed
by principles
<br>of good neighborly relations. The coup is of course a disappointing
<br>development. It's matter of concern for us. It is no doubt indicative
of a certain
<br>degree of impatience with the demands of democracy. The new order in
<br>Pakistan is yet to stabilize. We are still watching the situation.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: Do you have anybody in Pakistan that you can pick up the
phone and talk to if there is a problem?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: We are in touch with the government of Pakistan, whatever
the nature of the government.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: The man at the top of that government now, General Pervez
Musharraf, initiated the action in Kargil. Does that indicate anything
about the
<br>direction Pakistan may be moving in?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: I won't comment on the direction on which Pakistan has
already set itself. We'll watch the situation.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: What is your biggest foreign policy concern right now?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: How far are we from the new millennium--six weeks? This
is not simply India's challenge, it is a global challenge--how to distill
the lessons of the 20th century so that we are able move into a better
future as 2000 dawns. If the 20th
<br>century was marked by the ascendancy of the importance of man and was
the century of democracy, let us then convert political democracy
<br>into real economic democracy.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: Has the development of the globalized economy been kind
to India?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: I am not a globalization fundamentalist. I am greatly
attracted by the underlying theme, that globalization will lead to greater
equalization. If
<br>globalization is the economic equivalent of political democracy, it's
welcome. But it would be an error to treat it as a panacea. I am cautious
about cure-all suggestions. I do believe in the creative genius of individuals,
in free enterprise and
<br>economic liberalization. But under the guise of economic liberalization,
we mustn't permit the perpetuation of disparities.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: Speaking of globalization, will China's accession to the
WTO make it a responsible global partner, or will it merely make China
a stronger country able to intimidate its neighbors more effectively?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: India has always stood for China's entry into the WTO.
We believe that this will open the markets in China to the rest of the
global community and that China will then have to compete with other countries
on more equal terms.
<p><b>TIME</b>: When India tested its nuclear weapons last year, Defense
Minister George Fernandes said that one of the main reasons was to protect
India from
<br>a nuclear-armed China. Has that position changed?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: My good friend George's statement has been inaccurately
put across. Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs tend to have different
approaches to international issues, just as the Pentagon and the U.S. State
Department do. But
<br>India's nuclear program is neither country-specific nor threat-specific.
It is an answer to a wholly iniquitous new nuclear&nbsp; security&nbsp;
paradigm that has come into existence since the end of the cold war. Our
program is aimed at acquiring for India strategic space and strategic autonomy.We
remain committed to a wholly defensive posture with minimum credible deterrence.
We are for global disarmament and for global elimination of all weapons
of mass destruction.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: Did the testing accomplish its objectives by making your
job easier?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: Yes, it did. It was a well-thought-out project. It was
a continuity--rather
<br>than an aberration--of policy, and it achieved the objectives of giving
India
<br>additional strategic space and autonomy.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: And this hasn't been diminished by Pakistan's parallel
development of a
<br>nuclear program?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: If you reflect on what I said about India's program being
neither
<br>country-specific nor threat-specific, then the question would not arise.
I am
<br>mindful of the fact that Pakistan has policies and programs that are
centered
<br>around what India does or does not do. But it would be an error to
assume that
<br>Indian policies and the path that it adopts are in any sense a reaction
to what
<br>does or does not happen in Pakistan.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: The militant uprising in Kashmir is now 10 years old. The
army is still in
<br>the cities, but a solution remains elusive. Are any new initiatives
being taken to
<br>break the deadlock?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: What you term militancy is an externally inspired and
aided insurgency.
<br>The armed forces of India have to be present in the state of Jammu
and
<br>Kashmir to perform a duty which any armed forces of any country will
be
<br>required to perform--to safeguard its borders and to take necessary
action
<br>against externally aided terrorism.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: So the soldiers will remain in the cities indefinitely?
Or have there been
<br>other initiatives?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: We have just held a general election there, and the chief
minister of the
<br>state has been talking of local-body elections. But if terrorists continue
to come
<br>from across the border and infiltrate the urban centers, the security
forces will
<br>have to be present to take action.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: So the solution is ... ?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: Stop cross-border terrorism.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: The turnout in the elections was very low, particularly
in Srinagar and the
<br>Kashmir valley. Do you attribute this entirely to intimidation by militant
groups?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: Yes, I do.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: I [Ghosh] visited the state during the elections and the
sense I got was
<br>quite different. The people say they don't trust the election system
and certainly
<br>didn't trust the chief minister. Do you get that sort of feedback at
all?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: I am sure if you went around the streets of Hong Kong
and talked to
<br>people, they might not be entirely supportive [of the government].
I am aware of
<br>the challenges and difficulties that we face, but we will answer those
difficulties
<br>and meet those challenges. If this cross-border terrorism is discontinued,
the
<br>people will be at peace. The state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral
part of
<br>India. The difficulties in Jammu and Kashmir are as important to our
government
<br>as are, for example, the difficulties that we are encountering in the
eastern state
<br>of Orissa, which was recently devastated by a cyclone.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: To what extent has the presence of the Dalai Lama and his
followers in
<br>India hindered your relations with Beijing?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: The Dalai Lama is an honored guest, and he has the freedom
to
<br>practice his religion in India. But he does not practice any politics
there. We
<br>recognize China's position on Tibet and its sovereignty.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: You were host to another global religious figure recently,
the Pope. Do
<br>you think it's unfortunate that he made remarks about the need to convert
the
<br>people of India to Christianity?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: The Pope combines two functions--he is head of state
of the Vatican
<br>and head of the Catholic Church. My obligation to the head of state
was to
<br>accord to him total cooperation to make his visit as successful as
possible. As
<br>head of the church, we made all the arrangements to ensure his security
and to
<br>ensure that no impediments were placed in his path.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: So you don't consider that his presence ...&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: I don't comment on religious matters.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: Actually this is a matter of politics. The issue of conversion
has become
<br>a touchy one in India, especially among Hindus.&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: This needs to be placed in perspective. Conversion is
touchy not simply
<br>among the Hindus. Conversion would be touchy in Islamic countries too.
If there
<br>were conversions to Islam in Christian lands, there would be protest.
The
<br>protests in India were really far apart and very few. They were blown
out of
<br>proportion.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: China seems to have been vastly more successful in attracting
foreign
<br>investors than India. Are there any lessons that India could learn
from the way
<br>China manages its economy?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: India has nothing to be defensive about how we have managed
our
<br>economy. India will manage its economy as India. We are ready to learn
<br>lessons from anyone, but I think it is really the international community
that has
<br>to learn lessons from how China is managing its economy and how India
is
<br>managing its economy. As for foreign investment, I am informed that
nearly
<br>80% of the foreign investment in China has come from overseas Chinese,
and I
<br>do not know what lesson we have to learn from that. The democratic
process
<br>makes its own demands, and that process will inevitably be slower than
the
<br>processes of a totalitarian system. But the democratic process can
run a
<br>marathon, and in that it will be victorious. I accept that we must
reduce the gap
<br>between the promise of democracy and the delivery of democracy. India
also
<br>has to reduce the bureaucratic obstacle course that investors face.&nbsp;
<p><b>TIME</b>: Are you disappointed by the reluctance of the international
community,
<br>and especially the U.S., to be more outspoken about the death of democracy
in
<br>Pakistan?&nbsp;
<br><b>Singh</b>: The approach of the U.S. is course disappointing. It
is disappointing
<br>because the U.S. advocates a commitment to democracy and human rights
<br>globally. If that yardstick be applied to this situation, it is a disappointment.
But
<br>I also occasionally apply the yardstick of realpolitik. The U.S., after
all, is one of
<br>the contributors to the situation in Pakistan today. The U.S. has invested
<br>heavily in Pakistan over decades, in men and materials, armaments and
<br>money. Now the U.S. has run into a blind alley, and therefore there
is no other
<br>option for it to adopt than wait-and-see. It is disappointing, but
I have to live with
<br>it.&nbsp;
