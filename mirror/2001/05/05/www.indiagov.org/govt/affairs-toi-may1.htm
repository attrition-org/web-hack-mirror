<td><i><font color="#CC33CC">Representative Jim McDermott's relationship
with India spans 14 years and a record 15 visits - more than any other
US Congressman. His familiarity with India has even prompted a joke that
after retiring from the US Congress, he will lead holiday tours to India.
In the meanwhile, as co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on India,
McDermott is a key protagonist in efforts to enhance Indo-US relations.
He is also the chairman of the Congressional Task Force on HIV/AIDS. He
spoke to Rahul Sagar about some foreign policy matters, the AIDS issue
and US policy on emissions:</font><font color="#993366">&nbsp;</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">What is your opinion of the recent dramatic
change in Indo-US relations?</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">My view for over 10 years has been that the United
States should have better relations with India because of our need for
an ally in Asia and because of our similarities. I think the most recent
events with China have added a little fuel and heated things up with India
a little bit more quickly than they might have, otherwise.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">As one of the people who voted in favour of
Permanent Normal Trading Relations (PNTR) legislation with China, are you
dismayed by the recent controversy following the spy plane incident - and
the display of anti-American sentiment there?</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">I think you have to put it in perspective. This
airplane incident is a fairly minor incident and both sides know that this
is not something over which there should be any further escalation. I don't
think that it is an indication of any deterioration. I think that the reason
that the issue had to be resolved quickly by both sides was so as to not
inflame either public in any irretrievable way. However, there is clearly
a long way to go and relations don't change immediately. But if you don't
work towards becoming friends and trading partners - if there is isolation
from each other - then you will never iron out the differences.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">How optimistic are you that by adopting precautionary
measures, such as changing behaviour patterns, the AIDS epidemic in Africa
can be quickly and effectively contained?&nbsp;</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">It cannot be done quickly. I'm sadder but wiser
after having been involved with this issue since 1987, when I worked in
Zaire. I think that until we have a vaccine, the only way to control the
problem is through education that seeks to change behaviour. It is not
easy to do this because you are trying to get people to change their most
private behaviour. So it has to be done in ways that the ordinary person
understands and accepts.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">For example, I have been talking to African leaders
and asking them to use their traditional healers, school teachers and clinic
nurses - individuals who are trusted by the ordinary person - to spread
a clear and understandable message. Massive publicity will not have any
significant effect unless it is done in the language that people actually
talk about sex and communicate about this issue. In India, this means using
vernacular languages. Failing this you will not get people to pay attention
and it becomes ``somebody else's'' disease.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">Your first visit to India was on an AIDS study
that took you to Mumbai's red light district where the infection rate is
reportedly 50 per cent. Since then, how satisfied have you been with the
Indian response to the AIDS problem?&nbsp;</font></i><i><font color="#FF0000"></font></i>
<p><font color="#3333FF">During that first trip the Indian government said
that there were only 50 AIDS cases in India. However, after visiting Mumbai
I said that there were probably at least half a million cases because all
one needed to calculate was the infection rate and the level of activity.
But India is not alone. Most countries in the developing world have been
overrun with this problem because of the speed with which it has spread
and the immediacy of other concerns such as droughts. Consequently, it
has been hard for them to do long-term planning with any kind of intensity
or perseverance. They've started out with lots of programmes only to be
overwhelmed by other issues. I wish it were different in India but I think
that India is going to pay a terrible price in the next 10 years.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">What is your reaction to Cipla's plans to offer
the AIDS cocktail medication for under $1 per day in Africa, while western
drug companies can only offer the drug at $40,000 per year?</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Certainly, I'm not going to say, don't do that.
I do have concerns because the cocktail of anti-viral drugs is not an easy
course of treatment - it's not curative, it has side-effects and sometimes
does not work. So it cannot be the panacea for all of Africa's problems.
There is a certain public `grasping' for anything that might improve the
situation and I can't say that it is necessarily bad for people who take
the medication. For them, it is life-prolonging and I would not want to
deny that to anyone. But if we only set our sights on the idea of getting
the cocktail out to everyone we would not solve the problem because people
are continually being infected. Also, being a physician myself I worry
whether the incorrect use of the medication will result in more virulent
strains as with drug-resistant tuberculosis.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">You voted in favour of implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol. How disappointed are you by President Bush's statements
against complying with the Protocol?</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">The Kyoto Protocol might be imperfect but the
US has to be the leader in cleaning up the environment. For us to stand
back and expect the rest of the world to do it and not put some pressure
on ourselves is not worthy of a great nation like ours. Also it won't work
because we put lots of pollutants up in the sky. It reminds me of this
Biblical story about `don't tell me about the speck in my eye when you
have a plank in your own eye'. The US really needs to have a look at itself
and make changes. What's been particularly disturbing is the president
talking about lifting the CO2 standards which would result in power plants
that are not as clean as they should be. So I'm disappointed that the president
has not taken this as something that the US should be doing.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">You have highlighted the need to establish
programmes that raise the profile of the Indian viewpoint in America. Has
this happened adequately?</font></i><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Indians are largely unknown to Americans and the
only way you can get around that problem is to endow chairs so that programmes
start looking at Indian studies. At present there are some very good programmes
but nothing that will move them forward like four or five endowed chairs
would. I have been trying to work with the private sector and with Indian-Americans
on this issue.&nbsp;</font></td>
