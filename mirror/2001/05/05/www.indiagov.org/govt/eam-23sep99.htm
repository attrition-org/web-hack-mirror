<br><b>PRESS CONFERENCE OF MR JASWANT SINGH,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; <u>MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS</u></b><b></b>
<p><b>(September 23, 1999, New York)</b></center>

<p><b><u>Introductory remarks by PR</u></b> : I have the pleasure to introduce
to you the Minister of External Affairs of India, Mr Jaswant Singh. He
is not a stranger to you, at least to some of you. He has been in this
room before and to take advantage of the time available to us I intend
to launch the conference straightaway. The floor is open with the show
of hands. You can indicate if you want to ask a question. Please identify
yourself.
<p><b><u>Mr Ramesh Chandran, Times of India:</u></b> Could you please tell
us a little more about the Convention on terrorism which you referred to
in your statement and what do you think about your conversations with the
Russian Foreign Minister and whether there was any allusion to Afghanistan
nexus as far as terrorism is concerned vis-a-vis what is happening in Kashmir
?
<p><b><u>EAM</u></b> : The Convention on Terrorism is a proposal which
India has mooted and it is under consideration and has been under consideration
for sometime. We are reemphasising its centrality and importance as part
of current effort and understanding -- that internationally has been manifest
-- about the menace of terrorism combined with narcotics and trade in arms.
In my discussions with His Excellency Ivanov - we are meeting just not
in New York but just a week back in Almaty in Kazkhstan and before that
in the ARF meeting in Singapore - the question of international terrorism
figured prominently. He shares our appreciation that from South Caucasus
from Dagestan, the Caspian Region, Central Asia, Afghanistan and into South
Asia there is an unacceptable level of coordinated terrorist activity and
this needs to be addressed to seriously by the international community.
Specifically about the situation in Afghanistan, I have made known India's
viewpoints not simply to H.E. Mr Ivanov but during my recent visits to
the Central Asia n,Republics and I have covered all except Kyrgyzstan which
recently has been subject to terrorist activities and I find a remarkable
coincidence not only of concerns in regard to developments in Afghanistan
but also on how we need to approach collectively, through the UN, to tackle
this menace (terrorism).
<p><b><u>Mr. Al Haq, Egypt Press</u></b> : First of all on behalf of UN
Correspondents Association I want to welcome-you to this briefing. Yesterday
in his speech, the Pakistani Foreign Minister Mr Aziz had made a comparison
between the situation&nbsp;
<br>in East Timor and the one in Kashmir. I was wondering first of all
what your thoughts were on the comparison and its applicability and secondly
what India feels about the intervention in East Timor and the concept of
humanitarian intervention in general ?
<p><b><u>EAM</u></b> : I disagree with my distinguished colleague, the
Foreign Minister of Pakistan's assessment. There is no comparison between
the Indian State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and what is currently taking place
in East Timor. On the question of humanitarian intervention, I have made
known my country's viewpoints through what I said in the General Assembly
. We continue to believe that State has a role and a relevance, that strong
sovereignties result in a strong United Nations, not the reverse;as I said
in my speech that it is strong states that result into strong United Nations,
weak states can only result in a weak United Nations. We also believe that
the new postulates and theories about the intervention need to be debated
much more fully and defined, and cannot be selectively applied. On the
specific question of what has been taking place in East Timor, any violation
of human rights is a development that is both distressing and must be combated
and corrected.
<p><b><u>Mr. Scott Neuman, Washington Post</u></b>: We have heard reports
in the past few days to&nbsp; United states, unnamed indiviuals in the
State Department, suggesting to elements in the military in Pakistan that
they need to respect human rights -basically what appears to be a veiled
warning against any attempts of a coup. Is your government afraid that
the conflict in Kashmir recently has pushed the civilian government in
Pakistan to the brink ?
<p><b><u>EAM </u></b>: No, we are not afraid. As to what developments take
place within Pakistan, again an internal matter of Pakistan itself, and
as you worded rightly "advise" -- that the State Department might be giving
to whoever in Pakistan publicly or privately, India is not privy to it.
<p><b><u>Ms. Ambalika Mishra (?), Voice of America:</u></b> Question and
Answer in Hindi.

<br><b><u>Mr Ian Platt, The Guardian : </u></b>Can I ask in the light of
your speech yesterday and the speech of your Pakistani counterpart whether
countries elsewhere in the world should be concerned about the impression
that a serious arms race is now underway in your region ?
<p><b><u>EAM </u></b>: I do wish to disabuse you of that impression. There
is in fact no arms race now or even earlier. I have read what my distinguished
colleague from Pakistan has said. It is more of a reflection of what I
call the compulsive hostility that we have been experiencing. Any fears
about the arms race are completely unfounded.
<p><b><u>Mr Prakash Swamy, News India Times </u></b>: In the light of the
support India got from the EU and the U.S. on the Kargil issue, did the
Minister take up any issue during the bilateral talks or with the Secretary
General, What happened in Kargil or how India suffered because of the intrusion
?
<p><b><u>EAM :</u></b> Well amongst the issues that have come up - of course
this issue has feature because it has been an incident of the recent past
and it is an issue - but the larger dimension of it is the encouragement
of across the border terrorism and the manifestation of terrorism on a
much larger scale in many other countries now and the need to understand
this phenomena and to address it collectively.
<p><b><u>Mr Chidanand Rajghafta, Indian Express :</u></b> Sir, two specific
questions about CTBT. You have spoken about creating&nbsp; the widest possible
consensus in India towards the CTBT. When do you think you would achieve
that and at what point do you think this would arrive ? And two, are you
happy or satisfied with the steps that the Clinton Administration has taken
to make it more conducive for India to sign the Test Ban Treaty ?
<p><b><u>EAM :</u></b> First when and secondly whether I am happy or unhappy
about the Clinton-Administration. First is not really in my hands because
it is a matter to be determined entirely by the next Government which,
as I said, is now on the cards from around 15th of October. It is my belief
that next Government shall address itself purposefully to building the
widest possible consensus within the political community of India. As to
what the Clinton Administration has done, I can scarcely express happiness
at imposition of sanctions and declaration of entities list. These are,
I believe, steps that are counterproductive and do not contribute to, what
you would like to term as, my state of happiness.
<p><b><u>Mr K.P.Nair, Telegraph :</u></b>You said in your speech yesterday
that the dialogue process with Pakistan is open and that no preconditions
attend to it. Mr Aziz is for resumption of the Lahore process as well.
Yet one doesn't see the talks
<br>taking place in spite of the fact that both the Ministers are here.
Why is that and when do you see the talks resuming between India and Pakistan
?
<p><b><u>EAM : </u></b>I do believe that here again we have somewhat placed&nbsp;
the cart before the horse . I <font color="#000000">said</font> no preconditions
attached to a resumption of the dialogue process. There is already a composite
dialogue which is on the cards, which has got interrupted. There is however
another reality, that is also a part of what I said in the General Assembly
yesterday. Not as preconditions but as the essential ingredients of the
very process of Lahore or Simla Agreement itself and for the sake of making
these talks purposeful, it is necessary that violence be abjured and that
cross border terrorism be completely discouraged. This is not a precondition
but it is an essential ingredient and this is in fact integral element
of what has been stated both in the Simla Agreement as also in the Lahore
Declaration of February earlier this year.
<p><b><u>Mr. Joy Elliot, Reuters America</u></b> : Yesterday the Pakistani
Foreign Minister called for a conference, of nuclear powers to promote
the goal of strategic restraint in South Asia. Do you have any comment
on that ?
<p><b><u>EAM :</u></b> I do not have a comment on the specific proposal
made by the distinguished Foreign Minister of Pakistan. We do believe that
an expression of a larger global conference on the issue of accidental
use of nuclear weapons or prevention of use of nuclear weapons is something
that we have also suggested and that is something that we are recommending
to the UN General Assembly to address itself to.
<p><b><u>Mr Rohit Vyas,</u></b> TV Asia News: Sir, During the Kargil crisis
a number of Indian leaders had issued statements saying that they were
not sure whether the Pakistan Government of Nawaz Sharif was in control
of the situation. In recent speeches of yours right here in New York, you
have been talking about the key to rebuilding everything is to regain trust.
Do you think the Government of India can regain trust with this Government
of Pakistan ?
<p><b><u>EAM : </u></b>Let me share with you that when we talk of regaining
of trust, it is of course trust and discourse between Governments that
is an essential ingredient. But another factor and a very important factor
is the trust between peoples. I was a passenger on that bus that went to
Lahore, the public approval of that bus journey, the great enthusiasm that
it had generated both in India and Pakistan was an indicator of public
support to a movement away from the sterility of the past five decades
and a movement towards better future for the people of both Pakistan and
India. That is a factor of regaining trust between peoples also and these
are the challenges, that are the challenges of the leadership of both India
and Pakistan.
<p><b><u>Mr.Fayaz, Pakistan Press International</u></b> : There are apprehensions
about the
<br>nuclear doctrine. Could you explain why there are these apprehensions
at the Pakistan and at the international level and what was the need for
this doctrine? There is UNMOGIP in India and Pakistan. They are always
based in Pakistan. India never allowed their chief to visit the Jammu &amp;
Kashmir area. Why was this and what is your reaction ?
<p><b><u>EAM :</u></b> Second, I think it is a mistaken impression. After
Simla Agreement, both countries, India and Pakistan, recognised that having
bilaterally arrived at a settlement, the role and relevance of the Military
Observer Group of UN is no longer there and that is where the stationing
of the group in Pakistan came into being. The question is factually incorrect.
India has never said that the head of that group cannot visit the Indian
State of J &amp; K is factually incorrect. He has not ever been prevented
and he has had access to whatever he wanted to do in the Indian State of
J &amp; K. Secondly, what you call doctrine, it is miscalled doctrine,
the apprehensions in that regard are completely misplaced. It is a discussion
paper produced by the Advisory Board of the National Security Council.
Advisory Board is a large body comprised of wide range of public men and
women from academics, journalists, to retired officials and it is really
a discussion paper. It is not a pronounced or adopted doctrine. Therefore
the apprehension in this regard whether in Pakistan or internationally
are completely misplaced.
<br><img SRC="images/eam-c.jpg" hindi height=262 width=473>
<p>I want to say this in English. It is a noteworthy point, A question
that was asked to me in Hindi was on account of this deterioration in relations
during the conflict in Kargil, why were the two Ambassadors remaining in
respective countries. Because it is not, there is no war declared, there
was hostility, there was a war like situation, there was a premeditated
armed aggression but what I pointed out was that even during that period
the initiative about the Delhi-Lahore bus service worked on and the bus
operated on all those days.
<p><b><u>Mr. Khalid Hassan, Associated Press of Pakistan</u></b> : Sir
you speak about that it is necessary that essential ingredients Tor the
resumption of the Lahore dialogue, there should be essential ingredients
which ------- Now who shall determine this has happened, because Pakistan
denies what you said and what you charge it with?
<p><u><b>EAM :</b> </u>There is an objective reality, it is not a question
of denial and affirmation There is an objective reality. And as two mature
nations we have to address ourselves to the objective realities on the
ground.
<p><b><u>PR :</u></b> We are now to last two questions.
<p><b><u>Mr Raja Mohan, The Hindu : </u></b>Coming back to the question
of Pakistani proposal to an international conference on strategic restraint
in South Asia. What is our reaction, are we opposed to it, we are for it
or are we considering it ?
<p><b><u>EAM :</u></b> I do not believe that it should be limited to South
Asia. I don't believe that strategic restraint is required only in South
Asia and it certainly is engaging in a kind of simplicism to suggest that,
whether in nuclear or conventional terms, restraint is something that only
South Asia should demonstrate and nowhere else or no one else in the world
has to do. The reality is altogether different. And, therefore, while India
has always stood for and we will continue to demonstrate restraint, we
believe that such a conference about the restraint is better expressed
in what I have proposed in my intervention in the General Assembly.
<p><b><u>Bhaskar Menon : </u></b>During the cold war, Pakistan was supported
by the US and in the regional co by China. What is your perception now
? From where does Pakistan in its pugnacious attitude against India draw
support internationally ?
<p><b><u>&nbsp;EAM </u></b>: I would much rather not venture an opinion
on who or what supports
<br>Pakistan. That is really a matter of concern for Pakistan and is a
question best
<br>addressed to my counterpart from Pakistan. But so far as support goes,
I believe
<br>that an understanding of the Indian position during this recent conflict
is a
<br>demonstration essentially and this understanding comes from the widest
possible
<br>spectrum of international&nbsp; opinion and that&nbsp; demonstrates
more&nbsp; than&nbsp; anything else, that there&nbsp; was&nbsp; an understanding&nbsp;
about&nbsp; India's&nbsp; correct position. And I would&nbsp; much rather
treat&nbsp; international&nbsp; support&nbsp; to an indiviual&nbsp; or
any&nbsp; individual&nbsp; country as support on issues. That is what we
advocate.
