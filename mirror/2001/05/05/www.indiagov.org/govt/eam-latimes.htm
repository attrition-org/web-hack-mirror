<blockquote><font size=-1><b><font color="#333333">Jaswant Singh</font></b><i><font color="#666666">,
foreign minister of the world's most populous democracy, has helped orchestrate
the dramatic diplomatic transition in relations between India and the United
States. Reciprocal state visits - President Bill Clinton to India in March
and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Washington this month - marked
the new era, according to U.S. officials. The foreign minister was interviewed
by </font></i><b><font color="#333333">Robin Wright</font></b><i><font color="#666666">
during Mr. Vajpayee's state visit to Washington this month.</font></i></font></blockquote>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Q.</b> After decades of cool relations,
India and the United States are considered close allies, and you are considered
the architect of the change. Why the shift?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>A:</b> I'm not the architect. The
architect is the times, the circumstances, the transformed global situation.
In the years after World War II, the United States felt its national interests
were best served by a variety of alliances that didn't include India. In
those early years after its independence, India had to move into a position
of balance between the two competing superpowers, hence, nonalignment.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">What we need in Indo-U.S. relations
is stability and predictability. Also, the ability to engage with each
other with candor, in confidence and with the sense of being able to deal
with differences of approach on issues.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Q.</b> Despite improved relations,
U.S. sanctions imposed on both India and Pakistan after their 1998 nuclear
tests, remain in place. How much impact are they having on India?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>A.</b> We didn't believe sanctions
would have the results you expected. India has a continental-size economy
that sustains 1 billion human beings. So far, sanctions have been counterproductive.
Trade has grown by 27 percent over the last year, and it hasn't reached
its true potential because of sanctions. Exports from India are growing,
and imports from the U.S. are sluggish. So you're only hurting yourself.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Q. </b>Do you foresee any change
in India's position on nuclear tests and signing the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty? Under what circumstances would India use a nuclear weapon?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>A.</b> I don't see any circumstances.
We have announced a no-first-use policy. We've also announced no use against
nonnuclear states. Weapons of mass destruction are meant for the role of
deterrent.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">India has a voluntary moratorium on
any future nuclear explosive testing. We have said we will not stand in
the way of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
that our moratorium will continue until then.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">Since the substance of our obligation
on banning explosive testing is there, we're only looking at the style
- as to how you comply with that substance.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">We've said that until we have a domestic
political consensus on this issue, please have patience. We intend to do
it. Parliament will meet in November. It's my expectation that we'll have
a full-fledged discussion and that the political community will eventually
come around to a consensus.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Q.</b> A recent Central Intelligence
Agency estimate predicts a 40 percent to 60 percent chance of war between
India and Pakistan over Kashmir in the next couple of years. What odds
would you give the danger of conflict?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>A.</b> Far be it from me to comment
on the U.S. intelligence system. But if you were to carry out an analysis
of the historical factor of errors by this great institution, you would
be better able to judge. There are nil chances of conflict. I have something
to do with policy&nbsp; formulation. I know what is happening and what
we will do.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">Surely&nbsp; you should appreciate
that in 1999, we were put to a severe test in Kargil, not because we wished
to score points but because India is a responsible nation that believes
that, as a nation, we have a responsibility to the international community
not simply to our Western neighbours. We suffered casualties. As a soldier,
it saddens me. My son volunteered to be in Kashmir, and we lost over 500
men. But we conducted our policy, under the most testing times, with great
restraint.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Q.</b> Various governments dating
back to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi have pledged to grant Kashmir greater
autonomy. Why won't your government follow through?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>A.</b> As far as management of our
internal affairs and autonomy to states and decentralization, we had a
commission established on it. I just attended an interstate council 10
days ago, and we discussed the report of that commission on granting greater
functional autonomy not simply to Jammu and Kashmir but to other states
of the union and the government is moving toward it.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">But for you to consider Jammu and Kashmir
some kind of territorial dispute would really be an error. I'm astonished
at times that people don't point and out that 38,000 square kilometers
of Jammu &amp; Kashmir is disputed with China and is currently under its
occupation. The entire northern' areas are occupied. This is the real territorial
dispute.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>Q.</b> India has increasingly expressed
its desire for a larger role in the United Nations and other international
institutions commensurate with its numbers and leadership in the developing
world. What role would India play, and how might it change the balance
of power in the world?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><b>A.</b> It's ironic that in the early
years of the Security Council, a seat was offered to India, and in an act
of possibly the most profound historical abnegation, the then prime minister
said "No," it shall not take a seat unless China first gets represented.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">India, more than any other country
- as a civilization and culturally, not just because of its membership
in the non-aligned movement or the Group of 77 [developing nations] - has
to give voice to those who don't have a voice and those who are deprived
and fall into the category of want. This is not just India's duty. This
is the UN's obligation, too.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">In terms of the balance of power, in
India we have always known that the essence of power is to know the limits
of power.</font>
