<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">India and US are moving towards an agreement by
which Delhi would agree to accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
perhaps within a few months, would do so in return for having economic
sanctions, imposed by the US after India's nuclear tests last May, lifted
first.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The outlines of such a deal emerged after three
days of talks between Strobe Talbott, US Deputy Secretary of State, and
Jaswant singh, India's foreign minister. A joint statement ended on Sunday
hailed them as &quot;laying the foundations for a new, broad-based relationship
that has eluded the US and India in the past&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Both sides resisted publicly suggesting any &quot;break-through&quot;
from the weekend talks, the eighth in a series of Indo-US discussions prompted
by India's nuclear weapons tests. But both US and Indian official shave
privately suggested that the talks produced substantial movement towards
an eventual deal to lift sanctions in reutrn for India's signing the CTBT,
whch it has traditionally and staunchly opposed, around the middle of this
year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In an interview, Mr. Singh said: &quot;What we
are witnessing is the synergy of small steps, as against the explosion
of a 'breakthrough' as such - but the small steps are directed towards
a commitment the prime minister has given to the United Nations and India's
parliament.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's Prime Minister,
promised at the UN last year that India would work towards the &quot;successful
conclusion&quot; of negotiations regarding the CTBT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mr. Talbott yesterday met the Delhi ambassadors
of the G8 group of industrialised countries to discuss the progress of
the latest round of US India talks. The eight agreed to freeze non-humanitarian
lending to both India and Pakistan by multilateral agencies, including
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, in response to their respective
nuclear tests. The US has isnce waived the restriction on Pakistan, citing
its acute financial crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The persisting block on lending to Delhi from
international financial institutions has led to the deferral of more than
$2bn worth of loans from the World Bank and the ADB.</FONT></P>
