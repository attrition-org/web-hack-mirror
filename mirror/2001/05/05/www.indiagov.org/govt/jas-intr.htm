<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#9D7A5E"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Let's not
take the worm's eye view&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Apart from his
new portfolio of External Affairs, Jaswant Singh continues as deputy chairman
of the Planning Commission and heads a host of key task forces, including
ones on infrastructure, information technology and telecommunications.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/jaswant.gif" ALT="Jaswant Singh" HEIGHT=248 WIDTH=172 ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
BJP-led Government came to power at the Centre promising to be different.
What has it done in foreign policy to show that? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>It has already
demonstrated this. Take the May nuclear tests. I don't want to over-dramatise
it but without any doubt it is a defining event certainly in the last quarter
of the century. Not simply in terms of the scientific and technical experiment
but also as a switch from what was earlier a covert attitude to an overt
policy frame.<B> </B></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So what did
the Pokhran tests achieve for India?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>It has to be
understood that the May 11-13 tests were a continuity inasmuch as development
of the technology is concerned. It was a validation of the technology we
possessed. But in strategic terms what it did was to acquire for India
the much-needed strategic space. Also, we gained in the process a measure
of strategic autonomy. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>There was
a lack of cohesiveness in the response of the Government post-Pokhran.
We had different voices speaking on foreign policy and the home minister
even made a provocative statement about our policy against infiltrators
in Jammu and Kashmir. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>In a coalition
government it is entirely possible that people will speak in different
nuances. But to constantly pay attention only to the nuances and not to
the centrality would be an error. Union Home Minister L.K. Advani only
asserted the country's right to react to the externally-aided insurgency
continuing over decades. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But at a time
when we were trying to assure the world that we were not an irresponsible
nuclear power? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I am not going
to be defensive about protecting the country. You have had a series of
five tests which spoke louder than any voice can speak. That you do not
pay attention to the message of the tests but only to the detail is unfair.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Your colleague
George Fernandes said that your talks with Strobe Talbott did not yield
much. </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>That is a subjective
viewpoint in a very different context. What has been attempted is the harmonisation.
You reflect for a moment on the original agenda of P-5 and G-8 for India.
The 12-13 points that they insisted upon have now got focused to just four.
Surely it is not an arithmetic exercise alone to point out that there is
movement here. The movement was on the reality of India asserting that
we will not subscribe to the NPT. There is no going back on the country's
weaponisation programmme and the missile development and flight-testing
programmes. These are some of the aspects that were part of the P-5 and
G-8 agenda. I am not imagining them. It is a matter of simply looking up
the agenda and comparing it with what is happening now. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Where do we
see our relations with the US going from here? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What we are endeavouring
is not resolving but harmonising. I must say with total candour and honesty
and tribute to Mr Talbott, my counterpart in the US, that he accepts this
in totality. Resolving presupposes conflict. Harmonising denotes an understanding,
an acceptance of the sovereign right of a nation to decide its national
interests. I told Mr Talbott that we have a saying in Rajasthan -- Jis
gaon nahin jaana, uska raasta mat poocho (Don't ask for directions to a
village if you aren't going there). So we are attempting to harmonise our
relations with the US -- the world's greatest power -- in areas wherever
it is possible to do so. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The fear is
that the US is pressurising India to define a minimum deterrence according
to its terms? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>India is too
great a country to be pressurised like that. Minimum deterrence is not
a physical quantification. It is not a fixity. It is the enunciation of
a fixity. The principle is in contrast to cold-war phraseology. It is to
be determined in accordance with the reality of an assessment of the security
situation. And as the security situation alters with time, the determination
of a minimum deterrence also alters. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Will you be
able to overcome the huge political resistance to signing the CTBT? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is an evolutionary
process attained through consultation and exchange of ideas. I do believe
we are moving towards achieving a national viewpoint. My senior colleague
Mr Gujral likes to say that between India and the CTBT and the NPT there
is a Lakshman Rekha. I would only point out that we are on the right side
of the Lakshman Rekha. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Moving to
China, have we handled our post-Pokhran relations with our neighbour well
or not? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Can you reverse
the question and ask it? </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Why?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>There is a need
to ask. Then it becomes a different analysis because things have to be
seen in its totality. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But defence
minister Fernandes said that China was India's enemy No. 1 even before
the tests? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I would like
to know in what context the defence minister said that. If you address
yourself to the annual reports of a few ministries it is individualised.
Does the Ministry of External Affairs have the same assessment of the country
as the Defence Ministry? It is simplistic in the extreme to compare the
assessment of ministry A with ministry B. And I wouldn't like to do that.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So how would
you describe our relations with China at the moment? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our relations
with China are what they have always been. We have our areas of mutual
concern which we adjust to. And our relations are based on the agreed principles
of <I>Panchsheel</I>. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What is going
to be your approach in terms of India's overall foreign policy?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Simply put, pragmatic
and problem solving. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Does this
mean shedding the ideological baggage of the past?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>We are transiting
into the 21st century and I find that the essential baggage today in international
travel consists of a suit and a laptop. In the face of the greatest adversity,
(Charles) De Gaulle, whom I admire, said that there is a great truth: There
is France. For us also there is a great truth. You simply need to recognise
it: There is India. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What is going
to be your emphasis?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I would only
like to draw for you a contour map showing the prominent landmarks of challenge
and opportunity. Not a detailed one-inch plan. Let us not be drowned by
detail. Let us not always have the worm's eye view. Let us attempt to have
the eagle's version. After all, they both inhabit the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So what is
the eagle's vision that India needs in foreign policy?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I do believe
that the sub-continent where nearly a quarter of the human population resides
deserves better. The challenge is: How can India's foreign policy become
a fit instrument for lifting 40 per cent of this one quarter of humanity
out of this appalling thralldom of deprivation and poverty? There has to
be an economic dynamic to it. I endeavour to articulate hereafter the direction.
Another priority is energy. Energy is security, full stop. If the country
has to move to energy sufficiency our foreign policy must play a major
role. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>And now for
a worm's view: how do you see relations progressing with Pakistan? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>For that you
have to reflect on the absolute centrality of lifting our subcontinent
out of the morass of poverty. Evidently a self-confident, economically
prosperous, socially at ease, politically democratic Pakistan is good.
Not simply for Pakistan but also for India and for the region. Our policy
must be guided by that precept. Everything else is then a detail. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do you see
a shift in Pakistan's stand towards talks from its Kashmir-first-or-nothing
approach? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Change in the
attitude will be judgemental no matter what I say. So I won't answer that.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>But has there
really been a major shift in our approach to Pakistan as compared to former
prime minister I.K. Gujral's doctrine?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The difference
is between pronouncements and implementation. We have implemented. For
the first time in 10 years the prime ministers of the two countries have
signed a joint agreement. It is a very significant step forward. Why wasn't
it signed in these 10 years despite the eponymous doctrines that you speak
of? Why was sugar not imported as we are planning to do? Why didn't technicians
talk about power transfer? Why did a bus service not start? My Government
has done it or is doing it.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>So what is
India now saying? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What we are saying
is move -- move towards the ultimate destiny. Don't be held back. We just
signed a free-trade agreement with Sri Lanka which is a path-breaking step.
It demonstrates the profound perception which is economic progress through
economic integration. We are willing to sign a similar agreement with Pakistan
too.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You were earlier
tipped to be finance minister. Between the two ministries which would you
have preferred?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I might have
shed my uniform but I am still a soldier, soldiering along. A soldier does
what he is asked to do. I will be a soldier diplomat among others diplomats
soldiering India. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Were you disappointed
that the RSS had your name knocked off Atal Bihari Vajpayee's original
cabinet list in March? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I was not. My
name was given to me by my parents. It doesn't get knocked off. Let me
only say that graveyards of the world are full of those who thought they
were indispensable to the nation. I am not indispensable. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Is the RSS
against you because you don't agree with its philosophy? </FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>No, that's not
true. I believe that the fundamental aims of the RSS of nationalism and
character building can't be faulted. I am not going to comment on the details
of its economic or social policy. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What is your
view of the tactics of demolition of mosques or burning churches?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe that
this country cannot be constructed through demolitions. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do you agree
with the RSS emphasis on swadeshi?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I don't. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, then
what do you believe in?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1>If there is a
label I would put myself as a liberal democrat. I am opposed to state control
and continue to be opposed to the regime of quotas, licences and permits
which held India to ransom. It separated the state from the citizens. The
citizens become wary of touching the state because whenever they come in
contact with the state it stings them. Even in a simple thing like posting
a registered letter. Also, I do believe that in India there is no place
for a telescopic, narrow-minded vision.<I> </I></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
