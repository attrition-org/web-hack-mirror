<td><font color="#003300">Jaswant Singh holds the unique distinction of
being the first person, apart from the Prime Ministers, to hold both the
External Affairs and Defence portfolios in the Indian Cabinet. His recent
visit to Washington was watched keenly for the kind of reception he would
get from the Bush dispensation, after the warm relationship India had in
the final year of the Clinton Presidency. Singh spoke to Times of India
Washington Correspondent Chidanand Rajghatta at his Watergate Suite overlooking
the Potomac River.</font><font color="#993366">&nbsp;</font>
<br><i><font color="#993366">Excerpts of the interview:</font></i><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: Tell us first about your meeting with President
Bush.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: I was sitting with National Security Advisor
Condoleeza Rice in the Roosevelt room when he looked in and said hello.
We exchanged greetings and I gave him letter from the Prime Minister. He
said why sit here, lets go into the Oval office.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: That wasnt part of the script, was it? What
exactly did you both talk about?&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: Obviously I cannot reveal privileged conversation.
He walked me out to the verandah. We talked some business there. And then
he said lets go in (to the Oval Office) and sit down.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: What did you think of him?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: He is a marvelous person. I think great many
things that are being said about President Bush are completely untrue.
It was a very rewarding meeting that set the tone for the rest of the events
of the day. There was so many things going in Washington that day - the
vote going on in the Senate on the Tax Cut Bill, the China situation...but
he still found time to talk to us.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: So you see a smooth transition from the Clinton
administration to the Bush regime in terms of Indo-US relations?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: I dont just see a smooth transition... it is
much more. There is clear determination on part of President Bush and his
administration to go faster and very much further forward in terms of Indo-US
relations.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: Now how much is China a factor in Indo-US relations
and did you discuss that. Everyone is talking about the timing of your
visit.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: The timing is purely fortuitous. As for China,
it has been my constant endeavour that we in India must not allow Indo-US
ties to be a hyphenated relationship. It should not be a reflection or
reaction to other relationships. It should stand on its own.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: What exactly is happening with Indo-US ties?
How and why is it changing so rapidly?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: If you reflect on the reality of today, with
the end of Cold War there absolutely has to be a re-evaluation of all the
fixed points of assessment. The challenges to US security in today and
tomorrows world are no longer coming from the Cold War. If it is no longer
the Cold War, then what are we talking about? The U.S has an institutionalised
way of looking into these things and they are coming to the sameconclusion
as we have...</font><font color="#FF0000"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: Which you are saying is fundamentalist extremismand
terrorism...</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: There is now a very interesting coincidence
of Indias national interest and the security of the United States. Therefore,
the essence of statecraft, of management of relationship, is to find that
confluence of national interests. The Prime Minister used the phrase natural
allies. How to convert is this reality of interests into an alliance ofinterests
is the task before us.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: But there are many who feel Indo-U.S ties are
stillbedeviled by differences</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: Of course, there are and there will be differences.
But the challenge is not to let the relations be defined by the differences
that exist.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: So where do you see India's place in the 21stcentury
scheme of things?&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: We are a vast, populous, vibrant, and exuberant
democracy that should play a pre-eminent part in the affairs of the world.
India is India. We should present it without hesitation but without exaggeration.
Not with arrogance but not with timidity either.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: What about sanctions? What did your coming
here as Defence Minister accomplish?&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: (Smiles) We are supposed be under sanctions.
There isnt supposed to be military-to-military contacts. Yet the Defence
Minister of India was received by a guard of honour at the Pentagon and
by the Defense Secretary of the United States.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: But there was a lot of apprehension about your
meeting with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld because of his reputation as cold
warrior.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: Secretary Rumsfeld was not what he was. In
fact the guard of honour was not a conferment of any personal distinction
on me. It was an honour for India.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: SO you are saying there is a much better understanding
and appreciation of India in the U.S now. What has brought this about?&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: We have had a lot of thoughtful discussions.
For a long time, India has not been seen in its true dimensions. How many
people know that Indonesia is only 65 miles from the southernmost Indian
island? Or that but for POK, Tajkistan is just 27 miles from India. That
we had a border with Iran in 1947? Or that the legal tender of Kuwait till
1938 was the rupee? So when we talk about Indonesia or Central Asia or
the Gulf, it is because of our interest and our sphere of influence.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: And you think the Americans are beginning to
accept this?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: These are not lessons in geopolitics. These
arefacts.&nbsp;</font><font color="#FF0000"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: SO is there an understanding of the Kashmir
issue in the same context?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: I believe there is much greater comprehension
of what Kashmir is all about. It is not a territorial dispute. It is a
conflict between denominational nationalism and civic nationalism. Many
American leaders now understand it. Many people ask me what have we achieved
in our 8-10 rounds of talks with the United States. I think we have made
many of the sethings understood.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: To come back to the President, was he clued
in all these issues? What did he talk about?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: It is a completely mistaken notion that he
does not have a handle on things. He went straight into the core of the
issue. He started by saying he has have not been briefed on these issues,
but he had a goodgrasp of the situation.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: Why did he start with?</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: Why India and the U.S must work together. He
also spoke about the immense talent of Indians and the immense wealth he
said we have given them.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: So do you see a qualitative difference between
the Clinton administration and the Bush Presidency?&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: I am astonished that the President of the United
States chose to come in an arm-to-arm fashion to talk to India as if there
wasnt another worry in the world on such a tense day with the China incident
and the Senate vote.&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Q: There has been so much celebration about the
previous presidency that it would seem inconceivable it could be bettered.</font><font color="#3333FF"></font>
<p><font color="#3333FF">A: I have no intention of comparing the two. But
I have no doubt in my mind that what happened yesterday (his meeting with
Bush and three cabinet officials) is the start of a new era.</font>
