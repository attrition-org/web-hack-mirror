<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>As news of his election victory brought jubilant crowds
to his New Delhi home late last Thursday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
took time out from the party for an interview with <FONT COLOR="#000000">NEWSWEEK's</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
Sudip Mazumdar</FONT>. Excerpts: </FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=-1>MAZUMDAR:</FONT> If your last coalition
government could not survive with 18 parties, how can you manage 24 parties
now?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>VAJPAYEE:</FONT> The performance of our government with
18 partners has been creditable on all fronts. We gave the country a decisive
government that took major economic, administrative, strategic and diplomatic
steps. As for survival? Well, our government fell on account of one partner
who was being lured away by the Congress party. He was unhappy for not
being able to force us to accept untenable demands. Between the fall of
the government and the elections, more parties have joined us. This is
primarily because the BJP has emerged as the dominant pole of Indian politics.
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">What are your priorities? </FONT></P>

<P>We fought this election as the National Democratic Alliance [a coalition
of 24 parties].The NDA's agenda is to build a proud and prosperous India.
We want to accelerate the second generation of reforms — insurance has
to be opened up, taxation laws further simplified, infrastructure has to
be matched with the demands of the next century. We also want to cut down
government expenditure. We are determined to invest more on primary education,
especially for girls, on primary health care and supply of drinking water.
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Minorities still view the BJP and some of its
militant allies with suspicion. How do you propose to allay their fears?
</FONT></P>

<P>This &quot;fear&quot; is more a fiction than fact. Minority-community
apprehensions about the BJP are a bogey, a political tool to mobilize opinion
against us. If you compare the records of previous governments and ours,
you will find the past 18 months have been free of communal violence and
tension. Yes, there have been some reprehensible incidents, but they are
an aberration and not the pattern. Following one particular incident, the
killing of an Australian missionary and his sons, we promptly instituted
an inquiry by a Supreme Court judge. The inquiry was completed quickly
and its report made public without any delay. I may add that maintaining
law and order is a task of the state governments and beyond the purview
of the federal government. </P>

<P>In any event, I would like to assert that we believe in the principle
of <I>Sarva Panth Samabhav</I>, equal respect for all faiths. This is the
cornerstone of our view of secularism and the secular state. The state
will protect all its citizens, irrespective of their caste, creed, gender
or religion. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The recent election campaign witnessed the worst
kind of mudslinging by all political parties. What ails Indian politics?
</FONT></P>

<P>Well, elections in a multiparty democracy as large and diverse as India
can be a raucous affair. I personally feel that programs and policies should
form the basis of campaign issues, and not individuals. But the heat and
dust of elections carries away campaigners, and many things are said that
ought not to be said. This would be true for democratic elections anywhere
in the world. Once elections are over, we leave the campaign behind us
and settle down in our respective roles as the party in government or the
party in opposition. I would say our parties are still evolving. Whatever
ailment may afflict Indian politics, we have a cure — our unshakable faith
in democracy. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Do you think the Lahore peace process can be revived
even after the India-Pakistan conflict this summer near the Kashmiri town
of Kargil? </FONT></P>

<P>The conflict in Kargil was the result of Pakistan's misadventure — militarily,
economically and diplomatically. We did not inflict this damage on them;
they invited it upon themselves. My visit to Lahore reflected our commitment
to put 50 years of hostility behind us and build a new relationship based
on mutual respect and friendship. That commitment still remains. It is
now for Pakistan to reciprocate in a manner that will convince us that
they mean business. To begin with, transborder terrorism has to stop. If
Pakistan reciprocates in a genuine and credible manner, yes, the Lahore
peace process can be revived. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Will India now sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty? </FONT></P>

<P>We were in the process of building a national consensus on the issue
of signing the CTBT when domestic political developments forced a midterm
general election.That process of securing a national consensus will now
be resumed once a new government is in place. Some matching action by our
key interlocutors will help build the consensus. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">What do you expect from U.S. President Bill Clinton's
proposed state visit to New Delhi next January? </FONT></P>

<P>India and the United States are the two largest democracies in the world.
We share many common ideals, visions and concerns. President Clinton's
visit should strengthen our mutual friendship and pave the way for greater
cooperation between our governments so that both India and the U.S. are
benefited. I also hope that the visit will result in better American appreciation
of India's security concerns. </P>
