<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Statement by Dr R Chidambaram,
Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission <BR>
and Leader of the Indian delegation</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mr President,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">May I begin by congratulating you on behalf of
my delegation and on my own behalf on your election to the Presidency of
this General Conference. I am confident that under your able guidance this
General Conference will successfully accomplish the tasks assigned to it.
I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the entry of Angola
and Honduras to the membership of the IAEA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. I have great pleasure in reading a message
from the Prime Minister of India, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee: </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;The 43rd General Conference of the Agency
marks the end of an era. But as we know every end is also a beginning.
A new millennium beckons us. And we, as responsible member States, must
rise to the occasion and ensure that we leave behind a legacy, not a liability,
for future generations. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">We can best ensure this by returning to the
fundamentals, shorn of all rhetoric and verbiage and by acknowledging that
the primary function of the Agency is to encourage and assist research,
development and practical applications of atomic energy, with its multifarious
applications in power generations, improving health standards, enhancing
the quality and quantity of agricultural yields, in controlling pests and
in water resources management, is seen as the key to a better tomorrow.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's role in the nuclear power area
is particularly significant as this source with the progressive depletion
of fossil fuels , is an important option for satisfying the future energy
needs of developing countries in the long term. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">I take this opportunity to wish the 43rd General
Conference of the IAEA all success in its deliberations. </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>(Atal Bihari Vajpayee)&quot;</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. Early last year the Director General had appointed
a Senior Experts Group (SEG) to carry out a basic overview of the programmes
of the Agency as well as to provide strategic thinking, practical advice
and reccommendations for the future orientation and activities of the Agency.
The group has submitted its reccomendations, which could serve a basis
for planning the future programme of the Agency . The most important conclusion
of the SEG was that, I quote, &quot;the Statute has rather admirably stood
the test of time and remains a valid and viable foundation for the Agency's
activities into the foreseeable future. Thus, the Agency's 'mission', as
drawn from Article II of its Statute remains: 'The Agency shall accelerate
and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity
throughout the world.&quot; unquote.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Among these peaceful applications of nuclear
energy, and from the standpoint of developing countries and looking at
their possible access today and in the future to fossil fuel resources
of the world, nuclear power generation is the foremost. While the decision
to pursue the nuclear power option is no doubt a national one, the Agency's
mandate to promote in an objective manner the contribution of atomic energy
to peace, health and prosperity should not be eroded while it discharges
its responsibilities of helping to ensure safety and implementing safeguards.
Increasingly, the Secretariat has become diffident on nuclear power related
matters, perhaps influenced by the environment in which it is located,
where power generation, having reached a point of saturation, finds it
difficult to find support for new nuclear plants . However, while nuclear
power may be stagnating in Europe and North America, it is growing fast
in Asia and some other parts of the world where it is being looked upon
as an inevitable option to satisfy future energy needs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Nuclear power becomes even more relevant in
the context of global environment considerations. Presently, it accounts
for the avoidance of 8 % of global carbon dioxide omissions. It is unfortunate
that the Kyoto Conference on the Convention on Climate Change did not explicitly
mention &quot;nuclear&quot; among the cleanest sources of energy despite
the Agency's efforts in recent years in projecting nuclear energy as one
of the means for mitigating carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) evolved under the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Convention on
Climate Change.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6. Recognising the importance of the role of nuclear
energy especially in developing countries, India hosted an international
seminar on &quot;Nuclear Power in Developing Countries: Its potential Role
and the strategies for its Deployment&quot; in Mumbai in October 1998.
We thank the Agency for the assistance extended to us in organising the
seminar. We were also happy to receive the Director General of the IAEA
Dr Mohamed ElBaradei on his official visit to India in February this year.
I must add here that it was gratifing to hear the DG mentioning in his
speech yesterday morning, technology as one of the pillars of the Agency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">7. One quantifiable measure of economic development
of a country is the per capita consumption of electricity. For Indians
to reach a standard of living which will be somewhat comparable to those
living in developed countries it has been estimated that the per capita
consumption of electricity should increase at least by a factor of 8 to
10. Internal reviews have led us to conclude that in the coming century
nuclear energy will account for an increasing share of the electricity
mix in India. It is our endeavour to reach 20,000 MW(e) of nuclear power
by the year 2020 as a first step. In the last one year our efforts to accelerate
our nuclear power programme to reach that target have borne fruit. The
performance of our ten nuclear power plants in the last three years has
been improving consistently. In 1998-99 the overall capacity utilisation
was 75%. For the period from April to August 1999 the capacity utilisation
touched a high of 78%. One of the two Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)
units in Rajasthan, RAPS-2, has been producing power continuously since
6 June 1998 after successful enmasse replacement, with 100% indigenous
technology, of 306 radioactive coolant channels. I am happy to announce
that a state-of-the-art indigenously designed 220 MW(e) PHWR attained criticality
at Kaiga a few says ago on September 24. Another 220 MW(e) PHWR, the third
unit in Rajasthan is expected to reach criticality in a couple of months'
time. Work on the second unit in Kaiga and the fourth unit in Rajasthan
are in an advanced stage of completion. In addition, construction work
commenced on the two 500 MW(e) indigenously designed PHWR reactors at Tarapur
last October. The preparation of the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for
the construction of two 1000 MW(e) WERs at Kudankulam, in technical cooperation
with Russia is underway and is expected to be completed in 2001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">8. To ensure long term energy security India has
chosen to follow a &quot;closed-fuel cycle&quot; policy which calls for
the settting up of reprocessing plants and breeder reactors. Our Fast Breeder
Test Reactor at Kalpakkam, over a decade old, has achieved all technological
objectives. The indigenously developed and hithero untried mixed Uranium-Plutonium
carbide fuel has reached a burn-up level of 49,000 MWd/t (upto July 1999)
and has performed excellently as revealed by post-irradiation examination.
A programme of irradiation of zirconium-niobium capsule for irradiation
creep measurements was carried out. With the rich experience gained from
FBTR operation, the indigenous design and development of the 500 MWe Prototype
Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is progressing well and the construction is
expected to begin in 2001. The preliminary Safety Analysis Report on Reactor
Assembly, Heat Transport System and Component Handling have been completed.
A four legged walking robot for in-service inspection of the PFBR steam
generator has been designed and developed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">9. Mature technologies for reprocessing waste
managment and recycle of plutonium have been demonstrated and are available.
Progress is under way on the Thorium- Uranium 233 cycle also. In this context,
it is worth mentioning that because of our great interest in the closed
nuclear fuel cycle, we have always considered spent fuel as a vital resources
material. This was emphasised by us during the negotiations on the Joint
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of
Radioactive Waste management. The closed fuel cycle, adopting a &quot;reprocess
to recycle Pu&quot; approach after extended period of spent fuel storage,
has several advantages. It renders reprocessing and nuclear waste management
a more viable and safe technology, with reduced Man-Rem expenditures, since
it minimises the complication due to the presence of Americium-241 in the
recycled fuel fabrication process. The planning of reprocessing capacity
should be such that the needs of the fast reactor advanced PHWR, etc. which
facilitate the utilisation of Plutonium and Thorium while reducing the
input of natural Uranium (in the process realising the much higher energy
potential of Uranium) can be met on &quot;Just in Time&quot; basis, which
is a very important concept in materials management. Americium is not of
any proliferation concern and this has also been borne out by the Board's
recent decision in this regard.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">10. An Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR), using
plutonium and Uranium 233 as fuel is being designed at the Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre(BARC). AHWRs constitute a part of the third stage of our
nuclear power programme which will mark a transition to thorium based systems
as it will use as fuel the U233 obtained by the irradiation of thorium
in PHWRs and FBRs. Our 30 KWt experimental reactor, KAMINI at Kalpakkam
using indigenously fabricated U233 attained its full power. The facility
is being used, for neutron radiography and also for various experiments
related to neutron activation analysis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">11. The power programme has a support a support
base ranging from fuel fabrication to electronics and heavy water facilities.
Based on design and development at BARC, the Electronics Cooperation of
India Limited (ECIL) has produced the Supervisory Control &amp; Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system for switchyard and power equipment for the new power stations
in Rajasthan. This is a sophisticated system which provides for the monitoring
from the main control room of the status of various power equipment in
the nuclear power station and permits the operation of circuit breakers
and isolators in the switchyard. The Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) developed
a novel method for production of seamless zircaloy-4 square channels for
the two Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) at Tarapur which were hitherto imported.
The zircaloy-4 square channels are manufactured from seamless tubes employing
a square die and a draw bench.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 The past year has also been an excellent year
for the safety record of our facilities. The Nuclear Power Corporation
of India Ltd. (NPCIL) is a member of the World Association of Nuclear Operators
(WANO) and actively participates in WANO activities. In January 1998, a
WANO peer review was conducted at the Kakrapar nuclear power plant. Another
WANO peer review has been planned at the Narora nuclear power plant in
early 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">13. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)
stringently monitors the safety record of India's nuclear facilities. The
AERB has set up an independent Safety Research Institute whose main objective
will be to carry out and promote safety related research and analysis in
areas relevant to regulatory decision making. In the context of the Y2K
problem, the Government of India has set up a High Level Action Force to
monitor the status of preparedness in various sectors of the economy. Atomic
Energy has been identified as one of the 11 critical sectors in which an
in-depth review has been undertaken. The various stages of the review including
inventory preparation, detailed assessment and remediation have been implemented.
In addition, detailed contigency plans have also been drawn up. Further,
towards fulfilling its mandate as an independent regulatory body, the AERB
has set up its own committee to monitor and ensure that overall safety
is not in any way affected by Y2K related problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">14. We are now actively considering India's accession
to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials. Since,
in practice, we have been for long adhering to the standards of physical
protection prescribed under the Convention, this would only mean a formal
acceptance of the objectives of this Convention. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">15. We appreciate the Agency's efforts in preventing
illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Clandestine acquisition of sensitive
technology has occasionally occurred because preventing this also requires
the commitment of all the Member States of the Agency. In this connection,
let me mention that India's non-proliferation credentials have all along
been impeccable. We have in place export control mechanisms which have
effectively ensured that no material, equipment or technology exported
from India has been misused. It is therefore, no surprise that analysts
have characterised India as a classic non-proliferator. India's commitment
to global nuclear disarmament stands undiluted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">16. Since its inception, our nudear programme
has been characterised by a holistic approach. Thus, while power generation
is indeed a matter of priority, non-power applications of nuclear energy
in areas such as medicine, agriculture and industry are given emphasis
in our R&amp;D programme. The Isomed Plant, the facility in Trombay for
sterilisation of medical products operated by the Board for Radiation &amp;
Isotope Technology (BRIT), has completed 25 years of successful operation
and has been providing sterilisation service to medical industries in and
around Mumbai. There are three other such units functioning in different
parts of the Three units of Gamma Chamber 5000 have been supplied to Indonesia
and Myanmar through the IAEA and to Egypt against open global tender.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">17. With a population of nearly a billion, food
security is a crucial issue for us. Radioisotopes are being used to improve
fertilizer use efficiency, monitoring the fate and persistence of pesticides
in soil, ground water and environment, reduction of post-harvest losses
by extension of shelf life and preventing damage from insect, and microbial
contamination. Research efforts at BARC have resulted in 22 mutant varieties
for commercial cultivation. Radiation processing of a wide variety of food
items have been undertaken since 1994. A commercial facility for radiation
of spices is nearing completion at Navi Mumbai. The Radiation Medicine
Centre which pioneered nuclear medicine in India is involved in R&amp;D
in health science using radionuclides. Recently, we have tied up with a
Veterinary College to extend nuclear medicine facilities to small animals
such as dogs, cats and goats. Subsequently, this facility will be extended
to large animals. During the year, the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) Tissue
Bank contributed to the development of the Multi-media Distant Learning
Package on Tissue Banking produced under the Regional Cooperative Agreement
(RCA) for Asia and the Pacific under the auspices of the IAEA. In fact,
a wide range of R&amp;D activites fall under the RCA induding research
reactor utilisation, radiation protection, tracer technology and electron
beam applications. Recognising the importance of human resources development
we have hosted several regional workshops and training courses under the
RCA programme in the last year. Altogether we have hosted 15 IAEA events
in India during the period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">18. India conuntinous its staunch support to the
Agency's Technical Cooperation Activites. As in the past we are happy to
pledge the amount for the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2000 and payment
will be made on time as in previous years. Last year we had called on the
Agency to identify centres of excellence for human resources development
under the Technical Cooperation for Developing Countries (TCDC) programme
and had offered our training facilities to scientists and engineers from
developing countries. We would like to reiterate our offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">19. While the result of applied research are tangible
immediately, there would be no progress without investing in fundamental
research. We have an extensive network of institutions under the Department
of Atomic Energy engaged in fundamental research. At the Tata Institute
of Fundamental Research (TIFR), a LINAC booster for the existing Pelletron
Accelerator has been developed. The cryogenic aspects of the design and
fabrication has result in a spin-off for the cryogenic industry in the
country with many engineering problems being solved for the first time.
A 450 MeV Synchroion Radiation Source (SRS) Indus- became operational at
the Centre for Advanced Technology (CAT), Indore in April 1999 and the
first results frorn the experiments are expected to be available by the
end of the year. We have an abiding interest in fusion because of its potential
for clean and safe power generation and have set up an experimental programme
at the Institute for Plasma Research, Gandhinagar. The first indigenously
built tokamak ADITYA has been operational since 1989 and has led to significant
discoveries on intermittency and bursty transport due to coherent structures
in tokamak edge turbulence. Our second generation experiment - a steady
state superconducting tokamak, SSTI is currently under fabrication and
is likely to be the first such experiment in the world to generate 1000
second plasma pulses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">20. In our quest for improving the quality of
life the role of technology is pre-eminent. Without constant refinement
technology uses its utility. The IAEA is a unique multi-disciplinary science
and technology agency within the UN system. It should continue to be guided
by the principle that its credibility is based on its scientific and technological
competence. This can be maintained only, if the Agency keeps itself at
the forefront of nuclear science and technology assisting in the coordination
of research and development programmes among interested Member States and
institutions.Towards this end, research in frontier areas such as innovative
reactors and thermonuclear fusion should be actively encouraged. It is
important to realise that fusion plasma research not only prepares one
technologically to reap the benefits of fusion power when available, but
also leads to the development of spin-off technologies in the areas of
the large volume UHV systems, cryotechnologies large copper and superconducting
magnets, AC and DC power systems, sophisticated data acquisition and control
systems, lasers, microwave and spectroscopic diagnostic system, etc. The
IAEA has played a crucial role in the context of the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme. A similar platform could be provided
to non-ITER countries to think of joint long term actvities and to foster
linkages with ITER.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">21. The issue of funding the Agency's Verification
of Nuclear Arms Control and Reduction Measures has been discussed both
at the BoG and outside. In keeping with the &quot;Swords to Ploughshares&quot;
concept propounded in the early days of the Agency. It would be appropriate
to encourage activities to facilitate the peaceful uses of weapons surplus
material as fuel for nuclear power reactors and also for harnessing spin-off
technologies. Economic gains from such activities, which should be open
for participation to all countries without discrimination, could be used
to meet part of the costs. Such an approach would also enable us to make
further progress towards sustainable development in a spirit of balance
between the promotional and verification activities of the Agency thereby
converting the proposed Fund to a 'Development through Disarmament&quot;
Fund.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">22. As we enter the next century and the beginning
of a new millennium it would be worthwhile to hark back upon the words
of the founding father of the IAEA to see whether the Agency has indeed
remained faithful to its original mandate. In 1956, at the Conference on
the Statute of the IAEA at New York, Homi Bhabha, while recognising that
the problem of safeguards is one of the most serious and complicated one
facing the Agency, cautioned against the creation of a safeguards system
which would be unrelated to the realities of the world we live in and which
would reduce the Agency from being a positive creative force to a police
body. However, those warnings have not been heeded and, unfortunately the
changed orientation has overshadowed the original character of the Agency
as a promoter of atomic energy. I am worried that a situation should not
develop where many countries which urgently need to harness all available
options of energy to improve their living conditions are hesitant to venture
into this area as they feel frightened by &quot;safety&quot; and threatened
by &quot;safeguards&quot;. Let it not be forgotten that knowledge when
stifled atrophies and the world's nuclear heritage is too precious a resource
to be allowed to dissipate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">23. And this brings me to what I wish to say in
conclusion. I must reiterate what I recalled at the outset of this presentation,
from the report of the Senior Experts Group, that the Agency's mission
should remain to be to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic
energy to peace, health and prosperity. And I have also discussed how nuclear
power is the centrepiece of human development because of it having become
the inevitable future option for expansion of electricity generation in
the developing countries of Asia and other regions of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Over the last more than half a century, several
nations developed nuclear technology for power generation through multiple
approaches. And some of the countries which took the lead in this endeavour,
especially the USA, the UK and in Europe, have as a result of saturation
of their electricity generation, decelerated or halted technology development
while some other countries, of which India is one, have proceeded at a
steady pace in adding to nuclear power generation and are persisting with
technology development programmes. Clearly, the most desirable directon
for the future is to go forward in operationalising simpler innovative
techchnology for lower cost and, at the same time, ever-safe nuclear power
generating systems. I would like to strongly make a plea that it is in
helping to pool together the expert resources of the different nuclear
capable countries for succeeding with these objectives lies the Agency's
role henceforth in fulfilling its mandate handed down by Article 11.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">24. However, I must note here that cooperative
arrangements aiming at synergistic outputs involving a limited number of
countries, especially those limited to countries saturated with more than
adequate power production, are unlikely to meet the key need of the hour
which is to serve the best interests of countries choosing the nuclear
energy option to satisfy their unfulfilled and growing electricity requirements.
The IAEA must appreciate its unique position as the only international
organisation, not only in the UN family but also in a global sense, to
bring about the widest possible participation in, and thereby access to
benefit from, wholesome intemational cooperation. The IAEA owes this to
its Member States.</FONT></P>
