<td BGCOLOR="#FFF9FF"><font color="#000000">My Fellow Citizens,</font>
<p><font color="#000000">On the eve of the 52nd Republic Day of India,
I have great pleasure to extend to all my brothers and sisters living in
India or abroad my greetings and good wishes.&nbsp; To the millions of
kisans and mazdoors, teachers, doctors, scientists and technologists, who
have laboured hard to build up New India, I offer my gratitude and greetings.&nbsp;
And I salute the valiant personnel of our armed and para-military forces
who have sacrificed so much and who stand ready to safeguard the territorial
integrity and the honour of the motherland.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Friends, we are concluding to-day the Golden Jubilee
celebrations of our Republic and entering the 52nd year of the Republic.&nbsp;
The emergence of India as an independent nation and as a sovereign democratic
Republic was a major event in the history of Asia and the world.&nbsp;
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru articulated a new vision of India when he stated
that the word Republic meant not only political freedom but social and
economic democracy for India.&nbsp; To-day India has been acknowledged
as a great democracy – indeed the largest democracy in the world and the
Indian Constitution as the embodiment of the political, social and economic
rights of the people.&nbsp; At the heart of our democracy is the right
of the universal adult suffrage.&nbsp; It was an audacious and revolutionary
act by the founding fathers, to have introduced in one go, the right of
the vote to every adult citizen, a right for which the countries of the
West had to struggle for almost a hundred years.&nbsp; And that too when
the country was in a state of abject mass poverty and mass illiteracy.&nbsp;
This act of faith by the founding fathers meant that the governance of
this vast country was not to be left in the hands of an elite class but
the people as a whole.&nbsp; It also meant, logically, that the voice of
the people will be heard in the affairs of the State and their representatives
will be elected directly to the legislatures and Parliament.&nbsp; The
system of universal adult franchise also facilitated a dialectical process
on the political scene out of which could emerge a consensus in the midst
of all our differences and diversities.&nbsp; The founding fathers had
the wisdom and foresight not to overemphasize the importance of stability
and uniformity in the political system.&nbsp; As Dr. Ambedkar explained
in the Constituent Assembly, they preferred more responsibility to stability.&nbsp;
That is why they consciously rejected the system of restricted franchise
and indirect elections embodied in the 1935 Government of India Act.&nbsp;
It required a profound faith in the wisdom of the common man and woman
in India.&nbsp; To-day it is necessary to look back to this faith when
we hear voices pleading for a system of indirect elections. We may recall
that in Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan had introduced an indirect system
of elections and experimented with what he called basic democracy or guided
democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be an irony of history if we invoke to-day
in the name of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, the shades of
the political ideas of Field Marshal Ayub Khan, the father of military
rule in Pakistan.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Let us remember, it is under the flexible and
spacious provisions of our Constitution, that democracy has flourished
during the last fifty years and that India has achieved an unprecedented
unity and cohesion as a nation and made remarkable progress in the social
and economic fields.&nbsp; India to-day is adjudged as one of the fastest
growing economies of the world.&nbsp; We have managed to accommodate the
globalisation process without losing our distinctiveness as a culture and
a civilization and without compromising the independence we secured after
a long and heroic struggle.&nbsp; Through our Green Revolution we have
achieved self-sufficiency in food grains for our one billion people.&nbsp;
And our White Revolution has made us the largest milk producing nation
in the world underlining our food sufficiency with an important element
of the nutritional revolution that we are seeking to bring about.&nbsp;
We have emerged as one of the scientifically and technologically important
nations of the world.&nbsp; In the field of information technology and
bio-technology we have made spectacular strides.&nbsp; In human development
we have achieved significant successes.&nbsp; It is a measure of our human
development success that the average expectation of life of an Indian is
to-day 61 years raised from 27 years at the time of independence.&nbsp;
Of course, we have yet to abolish illiteracy and poverty from the land,
but we are confident that with the new tools of science and technology
we have developed and the determined efforts of the Government and the
people of India we would be able to conquer these problems also.&nbsp;
We have to do this by keeping ourselves in step with world developments.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">It seems for every stage of economic and technological
development there are policies and programmes that are appropriate to that
stage.&nbsp; In the 1960’s there was demand in the United States of America
for change in India’s basic economic policies as a pre-condition for aid.&nbsp;
A group of Harvard economists advised President Kennedy on aid to India.&nbsp;
They wrote in their report, “There are situations in which development
must already be established, before it is reasonable to expect private
enterprise to take primary initiative, for pushing it forward.&nbsp; In
such situations insisting that investment must be wholly or largely privately
administered from the start, may prevent preconditions for private investment
being established”.&nbsp; Indeed it is the growth of the public sector
in India that made it possible for private sector to expand and flourish
later.&nbsp; What we have done is to keep pace with world developments.&nbsp;
While making necessary changes in our policies it is important to recognize
the contributions made by India in its earlier stage of development and
that it is standing upon the shoulders of our earlier policies and their
results that we are to-day liberalizing and globalising our economy.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Friends, India in this 21st century will be predominantly
a young country.&nbsp; According to the 1981 Census, people in the age-group
of 15 to 35 years constituted one third of the population and in 1991 nearly
34% of the population.&nbsp; By 2000 almost two-third of the population
belonged to this young age group.&nbsp; Youth power is manifesting itself
in various fields of human activity.&nbsp; The spectacular growth of the
Information Technology is largely the achievement of the youth of India.&nbsp;
To-day it is youth organizations that are launching movements for preservation
of the environment, of literacy, etc. in the country.&nbsp; The National
Cadet Corps, the Bharat Scouts and Guides, the National Service Scheme
represent the active youth of the country engaged in promoting national
development.&nbsp; In the field of sports, Indian youth are making their
mark.&nbsp; The world championship in Chess gained by Viswanathan Anand
is an inspiration to all young people in India.&nbsp; Our young women have
also come to the fore in international sports and beauty contests, projecting
a new image of Indian womanhood of beauty as well as personality and intelligence.&nbsp;
Our children caught in hazardous situations have shown dauntless courage,
winning bravery awards of the nation.&nbsp; The story of Sunil Singh and
Mukesh Kumar of Kashmir who picked up the gun from his murdered father
and kept firing at the militants until they fled, is a heart-warming story.&nbsp;
I had the pleasure of receiving these brave children and other award winning
children at Rashtrapati Bhavan yesterday.&nbsp; Youth power is breaching
the old barriers and expressing itself to the admiration of the whole country.&nbsp;
It was Swami Vivekananda who said that by playing foot-ball you will be
nearer to God and that you will understand the Upanishads better by playing
foot-ball.&nbsp; We should applaud and encourage the new spirit of Indian
youth, for, they are our pride and our future.&nbsp; We, the older generation,
owe it to the youth that we set an example to them.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; My fellow citizens, we have declared the
year 2001 as the year of women’s empowerment.&nbsp; The pages of history
unfold the fact that all social and political movements and even great
revolutions, had bypassed women.&nbsp; Gandhiji was the first leader in
the world who brought women to the centre stage of a national movement.&nbsp;
To-day woman power is a hidden treasure that we are discovering and utilising
for the benefit of the nation.&nbsp; Once when Smt. Sarojini Naidu submitted
to the British rulers a petition for granting political rights to Indian
women, she was asked a poignant question: “Will Indian men support your
demands?”&nbsp; To-day the men of India are supporting, the movement for
women’s empowerment.&nbsp; We have already empowered women at the Panchayat,
block and district levels.&nbsp; Already there are nearly one million women
in local level democratic institutions.&nbsp; They have made an impact
on the working of our democracy at the grass-roots and have made a stir
in the society.&nbsp; It is only logical to carry forward this process
of empowerment of women to the State legislatures and to the Central Parliament.&nbsp;
The responsibility of the men of India in this matter is clear and unavoidable.&nbsp;
The empowerment of women in politics might well be a decisive factor that
will purify and save the democratic politics of India from the deterioration
of standards and values it is experiencing to-day.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; The awakening of the women and the youth
of India is something that gives us hope.&nbsp; But the march of development
is having different kinds of impact on different sections of our people.&nbsp;
It tends to widen the existing inequalities and create new inequalities.&nbsp;
The already marginalised sections, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,
are the greatest sufferers in this process.&nbsp; Referring to the tribals,
Dr. Ambedkar had said: “Civilizing the aborigines means adopting them as
our own, living in their midst and cultivating fellow feeling, in short
loving them”.&nbsp; But the developmental path we have adopted is hurting
them and threatening their very existence.&nbsp; It is well known how the
large river valley projects are uprooting the tribals and causing them
untold
misery.&nbsp; The mining that is taking place in the forest areas are threatening
the livelihood and the survival of many tribes.&nbsp; It is through enlightened
developmental policies that we can resolve such dilemmas of development.&nbsp;
One pre-condition for the success of developmental projects in our extensive
tribal areas is that we should take into confidence the tribals and their
representatives, explain the benefits of the projects to them, and consult
them in regard to the protection of their livelihood and their unique cultures.&nbsp;
When they have to be displaced the resettlement schemes should be discussed
with them and implemented with sincerity.&nbsp; This could avoid many critical
situations, and we will be able to carry the tribals with us.&nbsp; We
have laws that are enlightened and which prohibit the transfer of the tribal
lands to non-tribals, private bodies and corporations.&nbsp; The Supreme
Court has upheld these provisions through its judgments.&nbsp; We cannot
ignore the social commitments enshrined in our Constitution.&nbsp; In eastern
India, the exploitation of minerals like bauxite and iron ore are causing
destruction of forests and sources of water.&nbsp; While the nation must
benefit from the exploitation of these mineral resources, we will have
also to take into consideration questions of environmental protection and
the rights of tribals.&nbsp; Let it not be said by future generations that
the Indian Republic has been built on the destruction of the green earth
and the innocent tribals who have been living there for centuries.&nbsp;
A great Socialist leader has once said that a great man in a hurry to change
the world who knocks down a child commits a crime.&nbsp; Let it not be
said of India that this great Republic in a hurry to develop itself is
devastating the green mother earth and uprooting our tribal populations.&nbsp;
We can show the world that there is room for everybody to live in this
country of tolerance and compassion.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Friends, India has always thought of the world
and the happiness of others, especially our neighbours.&nbsp; It is in
this spirit that sometime ago our Prime Minister declared a unilateral
cease-fire in Kashmir.&nbsp; It was a bold and imaginative measure that
has attracted the attention of the world and gladdened the hearts of the
people of Kashmir suffering from the acts of violence by militants and
terrorists.&nbsp; On this Republic Day, let us think of peace and work
for it sincerely and tenaciously so that we can get rid of the scourge
of terrorism from this land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us persist in the belief that
the people at the other end will realise the futility of their hostility
and respond to our gestures of peace and friendship.&nbsp; I have no doubt
that through the firmness of our determination and through the exercise
of our traditional tolerance, India will triumph in the end.</font>
