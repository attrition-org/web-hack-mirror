<P>Mr President,</P>

<P>The image of India that generally comes to mind is of a large land mass.
But India is much more than that. It has an extremely diverse geo-profile
of a sub-continent, with some the world's highest mountains, hot and cold
deserts, and more than thirteen hundred island territories, among the largest
in the world. As Chairman of the Island Development Authority, I have personally
dealt with the particularities and challenges of developing small islands,
while simultaneously protecting their fragile eco-systems and unique environments.
India's developmental experience, our commitment to growth with equity,
dedication to self-reliance and attachment to the cause of South South
cooperation, provides for a truly unique paradigm, and has given us a wide
experience, developed in the service of our people, which we wish to share.
We. are fully conscious of the special needs and requirements of small
island developing States and empathise with them.</P>

<P>2. This is why India was represented at the First Global Conference
on the Development of Small Island Developing States, in Barbados five
years ago, by the Lt. Governor of Andamans and Nicobar Islands, one of
our largest island territories. Since then, we have attempted, within our
constraints and limitations, to implement the Barbados Programme of Action,
in spirit and deed.</P>

<P>3. In the last five years, we have strengthened existing ties and established
new links with small island developing States. Soon after the Barbados
Conference, we opened a resident mission at Ambassadorial level in Papua
New Guinea and established diplomatic relations with Haiti, the Federated
States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Palau. We invigorated our links
with their regional organizations; we have Observer Status with the Association
of Caribbean States.</P>

<P>4. More than thirty small island countries are now covered under the
lndian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme, or ITEC, for project
assistance, covering deputation of Indian experts, training of nationals
of partner island States in premeir Indian institutions and short term
study visits to India for their senior officers and decision-makers. Last
year alone, over eighty thousand manhours of training were provided to
one hundred and thirty nationals of small island states in India, in fields
ranging from diplomatic service, to management, audit and accounts, and
small scale industries, responding to the needs of capacity building so
well articulated in theBarbados Programme. We are familiar from our own
experience with the aspiration of self-reliance.</P>

<P>5. Nearly sixty percent of Indian experts deputed abroad under our technical
cooperation programme are working in small island nations in the fields
of agriculture, geology, legislative drafting, teaching, marine engineering,
fish toxicity, medicine and nursing and other areas, all of which our partner
countries have identified as areas where they need our cooperation. Several
infrastructural projects, like construction of hospitals, are also being
undertaken in selected small island developing countries, under ITEC.</P>

<P>6. Sigilificant climatic variability over the last few years has produced
disasters of unprecedented magnitude and devastation in some of these countries.
Again, despite constraints we have attempted to tend a helping hand in
such humanitarian emergencies, be it to the victims of Hurricanes Mitch
and Georges or the severe drought in Papua New Guinea in September 1997,
followed by the tidal wave, in June last year.</P>

<P>7. We propose to continue, in the spirit of South South solidarity,
to enhance our cooperation. with our partners in the small islands and
to impart to it a greater regional focus, building on the concept of multiple
beneficiaries, as put forward by the Secretary General of the United Nations.
We also have much to learn from them, not least in the development of the
tourism sector. We have entered into tourism agreements with some of them,
so as to learn from their experiences.</P>

<P>Mr. President,</P>

<P>8. We are convinced that fulfilling basic human needs, improving the
quality of life and increasing choices and welfare are the main objectives
of any developmental process. Energy is an essential component of economic
and social growth. We therefore initiated research and development, with
a view to harnessing new and renewable energy sources, even before the
energy crisis of 1973. As a result of sustained efforts since then, a substantial
manufacturing sector has emerged in India for the design and production
of non-conventional energy supply equipment. We now have one of the world's
largest programs for renewable energy. To give but a few examples, India
now generates more than 900 mega watts from wind energy, nearly 141 mega
watts from small hydro-electric plants, over 83 mega watts from biomass
and more than 28 mega watts per installed square kilometer from solar photovoltaic
systems. In addition, we have also installed over a million solar water
heaters and solar cookers, which decrease pollution and bring nutritional
benefits. Similarly, facing the problem of salination of water in our own
islands and coastal areas, we have developed low-cost, but effective desalination
plants. We would be glad to share this experience and knowledge with other
developing nations, specially the small island developing countries, which
increasingly face similar problems and have already strengthened the process
of broad-based interaction. Small island States can rely on India as a
concerned and committed development partner.</P>

<P>Mr. President,</P>

<P>9. Our contributions to the development of small island developing nations
and to the implementation of the Barbados Program of Action, are of necessity,
a small part of the efforts that are required from the international community.
It is essential that the international community and those more fortunate
than us shoulder their responsibilities for the provision of adequate assistance
to the small island developing nations. Similarly, they should also promote
the transfer of appropriate technologies to them, on preferential and confessional
terms. Other aspects related to the special vulnerabilities of these states
also need to be urgently addressed. We sincerely hope that when we meet
in a Special Session in 2004 to review comprehensively the implementation
of the Barbados Programme of Action, it would be to applaud the success
of such international cooperation, whose lack today we lament.</P>
