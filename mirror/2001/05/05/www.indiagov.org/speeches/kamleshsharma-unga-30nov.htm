<p>Mr President,
<p>The peace process that began in Madrid in 1991 infused new life in the
efforts to end the Arab-Israel conflict, an issue which has been of high
priority to the international community for decades. The Madrid Peace Process
was envisaged as a process of direct negotiations proceeding along two
tracks, one between&nbsp; Israel and the Arab states, the other between
Israel and the Palestinians. Negotiations were to be conducted on the basis
on UN Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the principle of
'Land for Peace'. The decision of the Arab countries, in particular Syria
and Lebanon, to participate in the Middle East Peace Process was a courageous
step which we welcomed and supported.
<p>Mr. President,
<p>The Lebanese track has shown considerable progress this year following
withdrawal of Israel from Lebanese territory and the deployment of UNIFIL
peacekeepers along the border between Lebanon and Israel. We welcome this
development as a step in the direction of realising lasting peace and tranquility
in the region. From the reports of the Secretary General, it appears that
the situation is generally peaceful and calm. In view of our deep, abiding
and historical links with this region, we have contributed a battalion
and supporting staff to UNIFIL.
<p>Mr. President,
<p>Early this year, there were reasons to believe that the stalemate on
the Syrian track would be broken. While this did not happen, there was
hope that progress could be achieved. The recent developments in the Occupied
Territories have vitiated&nbsp; and charged the atmosphere. We&nbsp; hope
that in these trying moments both Syria and Israel would continue to strive
hard to find a solution which would indeed have a positive impact on the
overall situation in the Middle East, particularly in Palestine. We remain
committed to the unconditional and full implementation of Security Council
resolution 242 and 338 at the earliest and extension of the authority of
Syria over its entire territory.
<p>Mr. President,
<p>The Middle East region, a cradle to human civilization, is of importance
and concern to the entire international community. Today, we are discussing
the situation in the region in an atmosphere far from different a few months
ago when the leaders of Palestine and Israel were striving hard to negotiate
a solution. These recent setbacks, a challenge to the sagacity and statesmanship
of the leaders of Palestine and Israel, have to be put aside and Palestine
and Israel have to work together for their common future. This year, the
first of the new millennium, which all of us began with hope and promise
to leave behind the shadows of the past, has to end on a happy note. The
progress achieved on the Lebanese track should&nbsp; serve as an example
of what it is possible to achieve with dialogue, goodwill and determination.
The path to peace is not easy, but it is the only path. There is no other
option, no other choice.
