<p><font color="#000000">"It gives me great pleasure to join you for, the
inauguration of this International Convention of Global Organisation of
People of Indian Origin. Many of you have travelled great distances to
attend this conference. In a sense, this is also a homecoming for you.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Today, there are nearly 20 million people of Indian
origin living in almost every corner of the world. Rare is the country
where you will not come across people of Indian origin. They have adopted
foreign shores as their own. But neither the passage of time nor the distance
between their ancestral land and their new homes has "been able to sever
the umbilical cord between Mother India and her children abroad.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">You are as much the inheritors of India's rich
civilisational heritage as your brothers and sisters back home in India.
And, we are proud that you have kept alive your distinct cultural&nbsp;
identity even while making a place for yourselves in a foreign social and
cultural milieu.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">We are equally proud of the fact that people of
Indian origin, wherever they may be living, have greatly enriched the society,
economy and culture of their adopted countries. The success stories of
Indian entrepreneurs abroad are legendary. From hi-tech chip laboratories
to curry restaurants, from renowned hospitals to famous educational institutions,
from well-known research centres to leading think-tanks -everywhere you
will find an Indian who has overcome all odds to establish himself through
skill, dedication and hard work.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Your adopted countries have benefited from your
unique contributions to their social and economic transformation. You have
also contributed towards enhancing awareness about India's past history,
present reality and future potential.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Indeed, from the sweat and tears of indentured
Indian labour toiling on colonial sugar and tea plantations in the 19th
century to the intellectual achievements of the Indian software community
in the Silicon Valley of the 21st century, the odyssey of the Indian community
at large is a reflection of the potential of our people and the magnitude
of their contribution towards global prosperity.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The Indian diaspora's contributions are not merely
confined to the culture and economy of their adopted countries. Despite
their numerical disadvantage, the Indian communities living abroad have
made deep impressions on the political processes of their adopted countries.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The active participation of people from India
in the nationalist movement in Africa as early as the beginning of the
20th century is well documented. Mahatma Gandhi's baptism in mass politics
was in South Africa. His joining the struggle against racial injustice
and discrimination was an event that proved to be a turning point in history
- not only in South Africa but also in India.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">India's struggle for independence was greatly
strengthened by the substantial support of Indian communities. The India
League in the UK and the Gadar Party in the USA&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">played an important role in mobilising support
for our struggle for independence. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and his
INA received the unstinting support of Indians living in South-East Asian
countries.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Between then and now, the Indian community living
abroad has come to play a determining role in the politics of their adopted
countries, not only as leaders of the Indian diaspora, but also as leaders
in the truest sense of the term. I recall that the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Summit at Durban in 1999 was attended by as many as five heads
of state or heads of Government who are of Indian origin.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">However, in this impressive success story, a blemish
has recently crept in. We have watched with distress the overthrow of a
democratically elected Government in Fiji and a series of subsequent actions
that have hit at the people of Indian origin in that country and more particularly
the poorer among them. The Indian diaspora abroad has an important role
in mobilising public concern the world over at the events in Fiji and in
seekin nothing less than a restoration in that country of due constitutional
processes as enshrined in the 1997 Constitution.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Friends, I have often come across people of Indian
origin who are eager to participate in India's nation-building efforts
- as a tribute to the country of their origin, as a means of strengthening
the bonds of love and affection that exists between them and India. The
cooperation and valuable support extended by people of Indian origin and
non-resident Indians during the last decade of economic liberalisation
and structural reforms have greatly encouraged us and contributed to the
birth of resurgent India.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Today, India stands on the threshold of a technological
revolution in many areas that define the 'New Economy' of the 21st century;
information technology, biotechnology, agriculture, space and energy. The
Indian diaspora, has made seminal contributions to the development of manyof
these sectors in their adopted countries. They can now playa vital role
by making a similar contribution to India in these sectors. Let me give
an example: We aspire to make India a knowledge super power by the year
2010: you can help us fulfil this aspiration.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Many of you owe your current success to the quality
education which you have received in Government run institutions, be they
Indian Institutes of Technology or medical colleges. You now owe it to
your motherland to associate yourself&nbsp; with India's search for rapid
and enduring social change and economic progress.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">I would like to emphasise that we do not merely
seek investment and asset transfer. What we seek is a broader relationship
- in fact, a partnership among all children of Mother India so that our
country can emerge as a major global player. We value the role of people
of Indian ongin as unofficial ambassadors providing a link between India,
and the rest of the world.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">My Government's policy is to assist the- overseas
Indian community in maintaining its cultural identity and strengthening
the emotional, cultural and spiritual bonds that bind them to the country
of their origin. We will provide all help to the overseas Indians in maintaining
their cultural identity even while encouraging their political commitment
to their adopted countries.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">With this objective in mind, we have constituted
a high level committee on the Indian Diaspora, headed by Shri L.M. Singhvi.
This Committee has been tasked to study the expectations of overseas Indians
from India. It will study the role that people of Indian origin and non-resident
Indians can play in the economic, social and technological progress of
India. It will examine the current regime that governs your travel and
stay in India as well as your investment in the Indian economy. It will
recommend measures to resolve the problems faced by you.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">More fundamentally, the Committee has been asked
to review the status of people of Indian origin and non-resident Indians
in the context of the constitutional provisions, laws and rules applicable
to them both in India and the countries of their residence.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">These will go a long way in developing a strong,
and mutually beneficial relationship between India and the Indian diaspora.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Friends, the underpinnings of our civilisational
history and cultural heritage have been the tradition of tolerance, opennes
to new ideas, respect for ancient wisdom, intellectual pursuit and abhorrence
of violence. The people, of Indian origin and non-resident Indians are
a living testimony to the noble tradition of blending the old with the
new.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">With these words, I am pleased to inaugurate this
International Convention of the Global Organisation of People of Indian
Origin."&nbsp;</font>
