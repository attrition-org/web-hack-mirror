<p>Your Excellency Mr. Li Peng,
<br>Madam Zhu Lin
<br>Members of the delegation&nbsp;
<p>I warmly welcome you to India. I am pleased that this is the third opportunity
of our meeting in the past six months. I remember the warmth with which
you received me during my visit to China in July last year. We had very
useful exchange of views. Your visit to India shows the importance you
attach to the relations with my country. I hope that during this visit
we can identify new areas of cooperation between our two countries. On
the important issues before the IPU, we have total agreement.&nbsp;
<p>You have made important contribution to the development of our relations.
Your last visit to India in December 1991 was part of the resumption of
our high level political exchanges initiated by late Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in December 1988. Our Government attaches importance to your visit.
Our President paid a successful visit to China in May last year, and our
Prime Minister will be meeting you. We desire to have friendly and good
neighborly relations based on panchsheel and mutual sensitivity to each
other's concerns. We also believe that all outstanding problems can and
should be resolved through peaceful dialogue.&nbsp;
<p>You are aware that among the problems that we have been discussing at
the IPU are the new challenges that we face as Governments. Many such challenges
come from non-state actors, and we need to develop new means of global
cooperation to handle these new issues. This is particularly important
for countries like India and China with their multi-ethnic and multi-religious
societies. The scourge of religious fundamentalism, terrorism and drug
trafficking is threatening to disrupt the stability of our region. We have
been a long-suffering victim of cross border and state sponsored terrorism.
But this is not a challenge faced by India alone.&nbsp;
<p>I believe that China is also beginning to face this problem. Many of
our Central Asian neighbours are also suffering from externally sponsored
terrorist activity. Excellency, in your address at the Conference of the
presiding Officers of national parliament at New York, you had expressed
your concern on growing menace of terrorism. We must cooperate to tackle
this menace before it overcomes the region. The phenomenon of terrorism,
which has now taken on a religious dimension, transcends national and international
borders. Countries in the region must understand that any form of support
or inaction is neither in their interest nor in the interest of regional
peace and security.&nbsp;
<p>Excellency, Political and economic cooperation go side by side. IPU
is convening a joint Conference with WTO and European Parliament in June
in Geneva to give a parliamentary dimension to trade. I am happy to announce
that China would be a member of the Steering Committee to this Conference.
Later in April, I proposed to take a delegation of parliamentarians with
CII, the apex Industry association of the India to your country to study
the path of development, you have adopted. This would foster a greater
cooperation between the two great countries of the region.&nbsp;
<p>I hope that Your Excellency has a pleasant and successful visit. We
also welcome Madame ZHU LIN. I hope that she is being well looked after.
<p>I am convinced that this visit will deepen our mutual understanding
and trust, in the days to come.&nbsp;<b><font color="#FF0000"></font></b>
