<td>101. Sir, I now present my tax proposals, indirect taxes first.
<p>102. In my earlier budgets, I have endeavoured to ensure a continuity
of approach in framing my revenue proposals. The principles that have guided
me have been the need for growth in revenues, simplification and rationalization
of the tax regime, and effective tax compliance through measures, which
are friendly for the honest taxpayer, and a deterrent to the evader. I
have reduced the number of rates in both customs and excise duties, simplified
procedures and introduced measures to improve tax compliance. I have given
up my discretionary power to grant excise and customs duty exemptions in
individual cases thus saving hundreds of crore of revenue for Government.
The policy of penalties against tax evaders has also been made non-discretionary.
With all these steps I have sought to put an end to a system that pressure
groups or lobbies could influence. My attempt this year is to take this
process to its logical conclusion.
<p>103. In my last budget, I had introduced the rate of 16% as the rate
of Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). I had also rationalized the rates
of special excise duty to three, namely, 8%, 16% and 24%. The single rate
of CENVAT now contributes about 68% of the total excise revenues from ad
valorem duties.&nbsp;
<p>104. I now propose to reduce the three rates of special excise duty
to a single rate of 16%. As a consequence, I propose to abolish the 8%
special excise duty on the following items:
<p>(1) Glazed tiles
<p>(2) Mattresses and articles of bedding
<p>(3) Carpets and floor coverings
<p>(4) Painted canvas, studio back cloth, etc&nbsp;
<p>(5) Linoleum and textile wall coverings etc.
<p>(6) Scooters and motorcycles, and
<p>(7) Taxis
<p>These items will now be charged to CENVAT only at the rate of 16%.
<p>105. White cement and other special cements, yachts and pleasure boats,
arms and ammunition for private use and articles of fur skins, will attract
SED of 16% and a total duty of 32%.
<p>106. The special excise duty on aerated soft drinks, soft drink concentrates
supplied to vending machines, and motorcars will be reduced to 16%, thus
putting an end to the rate of 24% special excise duty. These items also
will now bear a total duty of 32%. There will be no change in respect of
products, which already attract this rate of 32%.
<p>107. There are a few items that currently attract CENVAT at half the
rate, namely, 8%. All these items will henceforth be charged to the normal
rate of 16% except cotton yarn including sewing thread, LPG, kerosene and
diesel engines up to 10 HP, which I am leaving at 8% for the present in
the larger public interest.&nbsp;
<p>108. After these rationalization measures about 80% of the revenue in
respect of ad valorem duties will come from the single rate of 16% and
about 17% from the combined rate of 32%.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;109. India is the world’s second largest producer of fruits and
vegetables. However, most of these are wasted in the absence of proper
storage and processing facilities. Food-processing industry dealing in
perishable fruits and vegetables needs special support. I, therefore, propose
to exempt food preparations based on fruits and vegetables completely from
excise duty. This will include a very wide range of products of common
use like pickles, sauces, ketchup and juices, etc. This, along with the
support I have given to creation of better storage facilities will give
a fillip to the food processing industry and will go a long way in improving
the rural economy of our country.
<p>110. The Eleventh Finance Commission has recommended a special levy
for the replenishment of the National Calamity Contingency Fund. As an
ad hoc measure, this was provided for in the current year through a special
surcharge on corporate taxes. I propose to establish this funding on a
regular basis through a special surcharge of excise on a range of products
the use of which should be discouraged on health grounds. I propose to
levy a surcharge of 15% on cigarettes. The duty on biris would increase
from Rs 6 to Rs 7 per thousand biris. The total duty on pan masala would
be 55%/60%. Miscellaneous tobacco products like chewing tobacco would be
charged to a total duty of 60%.&nbsp;
<p>111. Excise duty on High Speed Diesel was reduced from 16% to 12% in
September last year. I propose to restore it to the normal CENVAT rate
of 16%. I also propose to restore special excise duty on motor spirit to
the previous rate of 16%. The burden of increase in duty is not proposed
to be passed on to the consumers except for any technical corrections.&nbsp;
<p>112. LPG is charged to excise duty at 8%. I propose to apply the same
rate of duty to Compressed Natural Gas, which is exempt at present.&nbsp;
<p>113. A special scheme of charging excise duty from independent textile
processors on compounding basis was introduced in December 1998. The working
of this scheme has resulted in serious distortions. I have therefore decided
to revert to the ad valorem duty structure for independent textile processors
with effect from 1, March 2001. Independent processors would be allowed
to take CENVAT credit of the duty paid on inputs on a deemed basis.&nbsp;
<p>114. There is no economic logic to continue with excise duty exemption
on garments sold under a registered trade name. I propose to impose a duty
of 16% on such garments.&nbsp;
<p>115. Products of SSI units are exempt from excise duty up to Rs one
crore. This exemption is intended to provide fiscal support to the genuinely
small producers. I propose to withdraw this exemption in respect of the
following items, in which misuse of the exemption is more than likely:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<li>
Cotton yarn</li>

<li>
Ball or roller bearings</li>

<li>
Arms and ammunition for private use</li>
</blockquote>
116. The excise duty structure on matches comprises rates of duty ranging
from 25 paise to Rs 2.40 per hundred boxes of 50 sticks each. I propose
to rationalise the existing rates to a more rational structure with a duty
rate of 50 paise for the handmade sector, Re.1 for the middle sector, Rs
2 for the semi-mechanized sector and Rs 3 for the mechanized sector.
<p>117. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the matter of rates of duties of excise I
have almost achieved the ultimate with only one basic rate of CENVAT and
one rate of special excise duty. The procedures in excise have also been
made modern. I can humbly claim that excise duty is now a model of value
added tax up to the manufacturing stage.&nbsp;
<p>118. The only issue, which remains to be tackled now, is the issue of
individual exemptions. The regime of exemptions is incompatible with a
simple, equitable and rational tax structure that has now been put in place.
I am not doing away with the exemptions altogether, realizing that this
may come as a sudden shock to those who are accustomed to exemptions. However,
I will like to give notice to them to be prepared to pay duties like anyone
else. For the present, I am making a modest beginning by imposing a nominal
duty of 4% on some items like goggles, imitation jewellery, rubberized
mattresses etc. which in four equal annual installments will be taken to
16%. More and more items will be put on this escalator every year.&nbsp;
<p>119. Structural changes have taken place in the economy with the service
sector growing faster than other sectors. I am expanding the net of service
tax and I propose to add the following services to the list of taxable
services:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<li>
&nbsp;Specified Banking and Financial Services</li>

<li>
Authorized Service Stations for servicing of vehicles including two wheelers</li>

<li>
Port Services</li>

<li>
Broadcasting Services</li>

<li>
Photographic Services</li>

<li>
Convention Services</li>

<li>
Sound Recording Services</li>

<li>
Scientific and Technical Consulting Services</li>

<li>
Telex Services</li>

<li>
Telegraph Services</li>

<li>
Facsimile Services</li>

<li>
On-line Information &amp; Data Base Retrieval services</li>

<li>
Video Tape Production Services</li>

<li>
Services auxiliary to Insurance</li>
</blockquote>
120. I propose to bring the service provided to lease circuit line holders
also in the tax net.
<p>121. I now turn to my proposals relating to customs duties.&nbsp;
<p>122. In my previous budgets, I have reduced the total number of major
customs duty rates to four, that is, 35%, 25%, 15% and 5%. I do not wish
to propose any further reduction in the number of customs duty rates this
year. However, I propose to discontinue the surcharge of 10%. With this,
peak level of customs duty will decline marginally from 38.5% to 35%.&nbsp;
<p>123. All agricultural produce already attracts the peak rate of duty
of 35% or more. Current tariffs on major cereals are: Wheat (50%), Rice
(70%/80%) and Maize (50%). I now propose to increase the customs duty on
tea, coffee, copra, and coconut and desiccated coconut from the present
35% to 70%.
<p>124. Similarly, I propose to increase the rate of duty on crude edible
oils ranging from 35% to 55% at present to a uniform rate of 75% and on
refined oils from 45%/65% to 85%. A lower rate of 45% would apply to soyabean
oil on account of WTO binding. I also propose to enhance the rate of customs
duty on the import of crude palm oil by vanaspati manufacturers from 25%
to 55% and restrict this concession to sick vanaspati units only. The others
will pay 75%. I wish to assure the House that in order to safeguard the
interest of our farmers we shall move swiftly whenever any perceptible
threat on account of imports is noticed.&nbsp;
<p>125. The House is aware that Government has committed itself to abolish
customs duty on IT and telecom products and their inputs and components
under the ITA 1 Schedule by 2003. The customs duty on these products is
proposed to be reduced to 15% from 1, March 2001 from current levels.&nbsp;
<p>126. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the abolition of the remaining Quantitative
Restrictions in April this year second hand cars will also become freely
importable. To allay the fears of surge in import of second hand cars,
the rate of basic customs duty on their import will be raised to 105%,
which is three times the peak rate. The total duty now applicable to second
hand cars will be more than 180%. I propose a similar structure of duty
for the import of old multi utility vehicles, scooters and motor cycles.
<p>127. In order to provide a level playing field for domestic liquor producers,
I propose to levy CVD at a suitable rate on imported liquor, taking into
account the levies of state excise on domestic production.
<p>128. Our textile industry has to modernize itself and acquire the latest
technology in order to face global competition and attain high quality
of production. I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on specified
textile machines, including shuttle-less looms, from 15% to 5%. As a measure
of further relief to the textile sector, I propose, to reduce the customs
duty on silk waste, cotton waste and flax fibre from 35% /25% to 15%.&nbsp;
<p>129. There are some cases of anomaly in customs duty between raw materials
and intermediate goods on the one hand, and intermediate goods and final
products on the other. DMT, PTA, MEG and Caprolactum are raw materials
for production of man-made fibers and yarns. However, the customs duty
on these materials is higher than the rate applicable to fibers and yarn.
I propose to reduce the customs duty on DMT, PTA, MEG and Caprolactum from
25% to 20%, which is the WTO bound rate for synthetic fibers and yarns.
Similarly, soda ash is an input for the production of glassware, detergents
etc. and currently attracts the peak customs duty of 35% along with the
final products. I propose to reduce it to 20%. I also propose to reduce
the customs duty on polyester chips and nylon chips for the manufacture
of fibers and yarns from 35% to 25%.
<p>130. On the same analogy, the customs duty on high quality DBM, seawater
magnesia and fused magnesia is being reduced from 25% to 15%.
<p>131. Gems and jewellery have considerable potential for export. I propose
to reduce the customs duty on cut and polished coloured gem stones from
35% to 15%. I also propose to reduce the customs duty on specified equipment
when imported by training institutes sponsored by the Gem and Jewellery
Export Promotion Council from 25% to 15%. The rate of customs duty on rough
diamonds would now be 5%.
<p>132. CNG kits and their parts attract low duty at 5%. I propose to extend
the same treatment to LPG conversion kits and their parts.&nbsp;
<p>133. LNG is not produced in India. The burden of CVD on the import of
LNG adds to the cost of LNG projects. I therefore propose to exempt LNG
from CVD.
<p>134. For the same reason, I also propose to exempt wattle extract from
the application of CVD.&nbsp;
<p>135. I propose to reduce the customs duty on cement, and clinkers from
35% to 25%. I am confident that this reduction would help softening of
domestic prices of cement for the benefit of consumers.
<p>136. Mr. Speaker, Sir, accredited pressmen and cameramen are allowed
to import cameras, computers, fax machine etc. up to a value of one lakh
rupees for their professional use without payment of customs duty once
in five years. In view of many good photographs they have taken of use,
I propose to reduce this long waiting period from five years to two years.
<p>137. In order to encourage better quality of cinematography I propose
to reduce the customs duty on cinematographic cameras, projectors and certain
other related equipment used by the film industry from 25% to 15%.&nbsp;
<p>138. In order to discourage smuggling I propose to reduce the duty on
gold from Rs 400 per 10 grams to Rs 250 per 10 grams.&nbsp;
<p>139. Several industry associations have pointed out that the CVD on
the imported consumer products should also be charged on the basis of maximum
retail price; otherwise it does not provide a level playing field. I accept
the logic of their argument. The Finance Bill contains the enabling provision
to implement this decision.&nbsp;
<p>140. I propose to withdraw the exemption from customs duty on a few
items and impose on them a nominal duty of 5%.&nbsp;
<p>141. I have already promised that our customs tariff would be brought
down to East Asian levels. I will like to move progressively within three
years to reduce the number of rates to the minimum with a peak rate of
20%. The modalities for this will be worked out in time for the next budget.&nbsp;
<p>142. Sir, a number of steps are also being taken for greater procedural
and administrative efficiency.&nbsp;
<p>143. A new Manual of Procedures and Instructions on Central Excise and
Customs would be brought out by 1, September 2001. The emphasis would be
on simplicity, brevity and transparency. I also propose to simplify the
central excise rules to make them user friendly.&nbsp;
<p>144. My proposals on the excise side are estimated to result in a revenue
gain of Rs 4677 crore in a year. On the customs side my proposals are estimated
to result in a revenue loss of Rs 2128 crore. I estimate that the indirect
tax revenue next year would be Rs 1,40,992 crore.
<p>145. Copies of the notifications issued to give effect to the changes
in excise and customs duties shall be laid on the Table of the House in
due course.&nbsp;
<p>146. In Direct Taxes, my thrust during the last three years has been
on providing stability of tax rates, widening the tax base, rationalizing
and simplifying the tax laws and giving impetus to economic growth. These
efforts have resulted in increasing the direct tax revenue from Rs 46,428
crore in 1998-99 to an estimated Rs 74,467 crore this year. In addition,
the number of assessees has increased significantly from a little over
one crore in March 1998 to 2.3 crore at the beginning of this year. I,
therefore, propose to continue with the same rates this year also. Co-operative
Societies, however, will henceforth pay 30% tax instead of 35%.&nbsp;
<p>147. While imposing the surcharge of 10 % on corporates and non-corporates
in my budget of 1999-2000, I had promised that this would be a temporary
levy. However, I was constrained to increase the surcharge on non-corporate
tax payers at the higher income levels to 15% due to the unexpected expenditure
burden of Kargil. During the course of this financial year I had further
levied a surchage of 1% on corporates towards the National Calamity Contingency
Fund and an additional 2% on all tax payers for the Gujarat Earthquake
relief. I now propose to remove all surcharges payable by corporates and
non-corporates except the surcharge of 2 % for relief to quake hit areas
of Gujarat. Individuals having an income of up to Rs 60,000/- will not
be subject to this surcharge.&nbsp;
<p>148. As a welfare measure, Sir, I propose to allow 100% deduction for
donations to the National Trust for welfare of persons with autism, cerebral
palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities.
<p>149. Hon’ble Members are aware that the modified one-by-six scheme,
which I introduced in the Finance Act, 1998 to identify potential income-tax
assessees and to bring them into the tax net, has paid rich dividends.
I, therefore, propose to extend the one-by-six scheme to all urban areas
in the country as defined by the 1991 Census. Changes arising out of the
2001 census will be incorporated subsequently.&nbsp;
<p>150. Certain companies are not filing their returns of income, presumably
on the plea that they are not having any taxable income. These companies
go out of fiscal discipline and their financial transactions during the
initial years escape scrutiny. I therefore, propose that all companies
should file their returns even if they incur a loss.
<p>151. Sir, another effective measure of widening the tax base is to further
enlarge the scope of deduction of tax at source. Income tax at source will
henceforth be deductible at the rate of 10 % on income by way of commission
or brokerage exceeding Rs 2,500/-, except on transactions relating to shares
and securities.&nbsp;
<p>152. Winnings from lotteries, crossword puzzles etc. are currently taxed
at 40%. As the marginal personal income tax rates have now stabilized at
30%, this income will also now be taxed at 30%. Television game shows are
very popular these days. I wish the winners well. At the same time, I propose
that income tax at the rate of 30% will be deducted at source from the
winnings of these and all similar game shows.&nbsp;
<p>153. At present, tax is deducted at source on income from interest on
time deposits only if such income exceeds Rs 10,000/- in respect of deposits
with a Bank or Housing Finance Company and Rs 5,000/- in other cases. These
threshold limits have led to the erosion of tax base and under-reporting
of taxable income due to splitting up of deposits. I, therefore, propose
to lower this limit to Rs 2,500/- in all cases.&nbsp;
<p>154. With economic liberalization, the pay package of salaried class
is undergoing many changes. It is being divided into various components
and the forms of perquisites and benefits or amenities provided by the
employers are assuming new dimensions. To align our tax system with the
present structure of pay packages, I propose that the value of perquisites,
benefits or amenities shall be determined on the basis of their cost to
the employer, except in respect of houses and cars where different criteria
will be adopted for simplicity.&nbsp;
<p>155. Sir, I also propose to provide relief to salaried persons in the
lower income range having income up to rupees one lakh. Such persons will
get an enhanced tax rebate at the rate of 30% in respect of their eligible
investments under section 88 of the Income Tax Act, as against 20% at present.&nbsp;
<p>156. In the case of Export Oriented Units, and units located in Export
Processing Zones, Free Trade Zones and Software Technology Parks 25% of
their sales in the domestic market are currently tax exempt. I propose
to provide for the taxation of profits from these domestic sales of such
units.
<p>157. I.T. Sector continues to do well and should be encouraged to do
better. I, therefore, propose that profits derived by the units located
in the software technology parks from the export of "on-site" services
will be eligible for deduction like their other export income. Units located
outside these zones will also get the benefit of tax exemption on such
export earnings. I further propose that the condition relating to transfer
of ownership of companies in sections 10A and 10B of the Income-tax Act
shall not apply in respect of companies in which public are substantially
interested.&nbsp;
<p>158. The income of NABARD, National Housing Bank and Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was exempted from tax in order to provide
fiscal support in the initial years of their functioning. Now these institutions
have come of age and are working on commercial lines. I, therefore, propose
to withdraw the tax exemption available to these institutions.
<p>159. The interest payable on certain External Commercial Borrowings
(ECBs) is currently exempt from tax. Having regard to the fact that interest
received by the lender is taxable in the country of his residence and he
would get a credit for any tax paid by him in India, any exemption from
tax liability in the host country does not benefit the lender but only
results in reducing our tax revenues. I, therefore, propose that the tax
exemption in respect of interest paid on such External Commercial Borrowings
will not be available for such borrowings made on or after the first day
of June 2001.&nbsp;
<p>160. Certain interest income up to a limit of Rs 12,000 is deductible
at present under section 80L. In addition, income from Government securities
is also deductible up to Rs 3,000. I propose to reduce the maximum limit
of this deduction to Rs 9,000.&nbsp;
<p>161. The tax payable on the distribution of dividends of domestic companies
and income in respect of Units of Mutual Funds and UTI was increased from
10% to 20% last year. To provide a stimulus to the growth of capital market,
I propose to reduce this tax to 10%.&nbsp;
<p>162. To help revive investor-interest in primary issues I propose to
exempt long-term capital gains arising from the sale of securities and
Units if such gains are reinvested in primary issues of shares of public
companies.
<p>163. Sir, the tax incentives in the form of tax holidays for infrastructure
facilities are proposed to be further rationalized and enlarged. For the
core sectors of infrastructure namely, roads, highways, rail system, water
treatment and supply, irrigation, sanitation and solid waste management
systems, I now propose a ten-year tax holiday which may be availed of during
the initial twenty years. In the case of airports, ports, inland ports
and waterways, industrial parks and generation and distribution of power,
which also become commercially viable only in the long run, a tax holiday
of ten years is being proposed to be availed of during the initial fifteen
years. The period of commencement of business for power and industrial
parks is also being extended up to 31, March 2006.
<p>164. The five-year tax holiday and 30 % deduction for next five years
was available to the telecommunications sector till 31, March 2000. I propose
to reintroduce this concession retrospectively for the units commencing
their operations on or before 31, March 2003. These concessions will also
be extended to internet service providers and broadband networks.&nbsp;
<p>165. Sir, in addition to the tax holiday proposed for development of
infrastructure, tax incentives have also been provided for the investors
providing long-term finance or investing in the equity capital of the enterprises
engaged in infrastructure facility. Any income by way of interest, dividends
or long-term capital gains from such investments is fully exempt. I propose
to extend this concession to guarantee commissions and credit enhancement
fees earned by financial institutions from infrastructure enterprises.
Co-operative Banks will also be eligible for exemption of their income
from investments in approved infrastructure facilities.&nbsp;
<p>166. To be globally competitive, our companies need to increase their
investment and expenditure for Research and Development. Currently, a weighted
deduction of 150% of the expenditure on in-house research and development
in certain areas is allowed to companies. Sir, I propose to extend this
weighted deduction to biotechnology as well for clinical trials, filing
patents and obtaining regulatory approvals. I also propose that the entire
amount paid to specified projects under the India Millennium Mission, 2020
will be eligible for 125 % weighted deduction.&nbsp;
<p>167. To encourage development of industrial infrastructure, I had provided
100% deduction of export profits for a period of ten years to units operating
in the Special Economic Zones last year. I now propose to give further
tax incentives for the development of these zones. The concessions available
for infrastructure by way of a 10-year tax holiday will be available to
the developers of Special Economic Zones on the same lines as developers
of industrial parks. The income of investors making long term investment
for the development of SEZs will also be exempt.&nbsp;
<p>168. The storage of food grains and their transportation are our major
concern. Sir, I propose to provide a tax holiday for five years and 30%
deduction of profits for the next five years to the enterprises engaged
in the integrated business of handling, transportation and storage of food-grains.
<p>169. Sir, for promoting the industry that provides the cup that cheers,
I propose to increase the development allowance available for tea from
20% to 40%. This additional allowance will be used only for re-plantation,
rejuvenation, and modernization of tea plantations and processing facilities.&nbsp;
<p>170 There has been a long-standing demand from the Shipping Industry
that the rate of depreciation available in respect of ships and inland
water vessels may be increased. I propose to increase this rate of depreciation
to 25%.&nbsp;
<p>171. To encourage investments in weaving, processing and garment sectors
of the textile industry, I propose to allow accelerated depreciation at
the rate of 50% on plants and machinery purchased under the Technology
Up-gradation Fund Scheme.&nbsp;
<p>172. In order to give a boost to the commercial vehicles sector presently
facing recession, I propose to allow accelerated depreciation at the rate
of 50% on new commercial vehicles for one year.
<p>173. Each of my past three budgets has provided for increasing tax incentives
for the housing sector. Sir, continuing with this practice, I propose to
further increase the maximum amount of deduction available for interest
payable on housing loans for self-occupied houses from rupees one lakh
to rupees one and a half lakhs.&nbsp;
<p>174. For persons having income from house property, the present deduction
of 25 % of annual value for repairs etc. is proposed to be enhanced to
30%. However, there will be no further deductions, except for the expenditure
incurred by way of interest payment on housing loans.&nbsp;
<p>175. I propose to extend the tax incentives allowed by way of deduction
or rebate on payments of LIC premium to all insurance companies that have
been approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority
<br>176. The presence of multinational enterprises in India and their ability
to allocate profits in different jurisdictions by controlling prices in
intra-group transactions has made the issue of transfer pricing a matter
of serious concern. I had set up an Expert Group in November 1999 to examine
the issues relating to transfer pricing. Their report has been received,
proposing a detailed structure for transfer pricing legislation. Necessary
legislative changes are being made in the Finance Bill based on these recommendations.&nbsp;
<p>177. The foreign telecasting channels will henceforth be taxed in India,
on their income computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax
Act.
<p>178. Sir, I propose to bring about a number of measures that will be
friendly to the taxpayer. The time limits for issue of refunds, reassessment
and reopening of assessments by the Income-tax Department are proposed
to be reduced. The Department will also no longer have power to withhold
the refund due to an assessee. Similarly, there will be no requirement
to obtain a Tax Clearance Certificate under section 230A from the Assessing
Officer before transfer of immovable property. I also propose to remove
the discretion presently available in deciding the quantum of penalties.
Henceforth, a fixed amount of penalty will be leviable for most of the
defaults.&nbsp;
<p>179. Certain educational and medical institutions are required to be
approved for claiming tax exemption. At present, these institutions have
to file their application for approval to the Central Board of Direct Taxes.
Sir, I propose to delegate this power to Chief Commissioners of Income-tax.
<p>180. To sum up, Sir, my proposals made in this Budget on the Direct
Taxes will result in a revenue loss of Rs 5,500 crore, which I propose
to make up with tax buoyancy and increased voluntary compliance. I estimate
that the direct tax revenue in 2001-2002 would be Rs 84,800 crore.
<p>181. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these proposals I estimate total tax revenue
receipts for the Centre at Rs 163031 crore and the fiscal deficit at Rs
116314 crore or 4.7% of GDP. I could have managed a lesser fiscal deficit
but that would have been possible only at the cost of growth, which was
unacceptable.
<p>182. This is a budget for carrying forward the second generation of
economic reforms. This is a budget for growth. This is a budget for equity
with efficiency. This is a budget for a new deal to the people of India
in the new millennium.
<p>183. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the budget to this
august house.
