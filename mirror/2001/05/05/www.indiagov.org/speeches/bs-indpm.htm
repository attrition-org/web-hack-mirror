<br>Your Excellency Mr., Prime Minister,&nbsp;
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen:&nbsp;
<p>It is a privilege for us to welcome you and the distinguished members
of your delegation to India.
<p>You are here at a time when we are coping with the aftermath of one
of the worst natural disasters that this country has seen. I would like
to express the sincere gratitude of my Government to the voluntary and
generous assistance, which your Government has extended towards our relief
efforts.
<p>Mr. Prime Minister, the civilizational linkages between our two countries
spanned the last millennium and built important bridges between the east
and the west. The intertwining of our ancient cultures is most graphically
reflected in the Gandhara School of Art.&nbsp;
<p>Our relationship today as modem dynamic societies is based on this rich
cultural heritage. We are both committed to the principles of democracy.
To Greece goes the credit of having given the word "democracy" to the English
language.&nbsp;
<p>We are proud of our cordial and problem free bilateral relations with
Greece. We hope these relations will catalyze a growth in our economic
cooperation. The business delegation accompanying you would have seen the
opportunities for trade and investment offered by India's economic liberalization
and industrial expansion. Indian companies also see a role for themselves
in contributing to Greek projects in Information Technology and other areas.
<p>Excellency, as we enter this new millennium, communications technology
and economic intercourse have shrunk the globe. But the blurring of national
frontiers has also been exploited by transnational networks of terrorism,
drug trafficking, gun running and money laundering. These networks have
become the tools of religious extremism, which threatens democratic and
pluralistic societies. As heirs to a tradition of democracy freedom and
tolerance, India and Greece must join hands to cooperate against this menace.
We can cooperate in international fora on a number of other issues on which
we have similar views. We share some ideas on making the United Nations
and its Security Council more representative of current realities.
<br>I&nbsp;
<br>Excellency, these are areas which provide the contemporary dimension
to our ancient relations. I am sure your visit will provide a strong impetus
in this direction.
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, may I now request you to join me in a toast:
<ul>
<li>
to the health of Prime Minister Simitis&nbsp;</li>

<li>
to the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Hellenic Republic&nbsp;</li>

<li>
to the further strengthening of the cordial ties between our two countries&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Thank you.</td>
