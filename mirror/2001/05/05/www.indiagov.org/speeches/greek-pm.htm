<br><font color="#000000">Mr., Prime Minister, distinguished guests,&nbsp;</font>
<p>I would have liked to begin my address to you, by expressing my satisfaction
for being your guest in this fascinating country that India is. But the
so recent event of the devastating earthquake, which has striken North-Western
India and resulted in the tragic loss of thousands of lives, prevents any
kind of rejoicing. I wish to convey to you my sincere condolences and through
you the sympathy and solidarity of the Greek government and people to the
people of India for this unexpected suffering.
<p>Our sadness, though, cannot prevent me from expressing to you our appreciation
for your warm welcome, your kind words and your hospitality. We are grateful
for being here, in India, one of the most ancient cradles of civilization.
Your country, while respecting its old traditions, has wisely combined
them with modem development, scientific progress and technological expertise,
thus attracting the admiration of the whole world. Adding to those achievements
the fact that today's India is a multicultural democracy, where different
religions, ethnic groups and so many different languages have all their
rightful place and respect, one can understand why you enter the 21" century
confident about your important role and influence in world affairs.
<p>With this great country and its people, Greece has the privilege to
enjoy a long-standing friendship and excellent political relations. This
is reflected in both our close cooperation within international organizations
and our mutual understanding in regional problems, that our countries face
and for which they are seeking solutions.
<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Prime Minister,&nbsp;</font>
<p>Excellent as our bilateral relations are in the political field, I feel
that both our countries should intensify their efforts to fully develop
the existing great potential of their cooperation in trade, investment,
information technology, agriculture, merchant marine and the economic sector
in general. For this reason, I am accompanied in this visit by businessmen
in order to enable them to examine possibilities of cooperation. I hope
that my visit will prove fruitful in this respect.&nbsp;
<p>I would like also to express my satisfaction for the level of our cultural
exchanges. A substantial step took place last September, with the establishment
of the "Dimitrios Galanos" Chair for Hellenic Studies at the Nehru University
in New Delhi. It is one more happy occasion, where two great and ancient
civilizations meet.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Prime Minister,&nbsp;</font>
<p>Greece supports a just and peaceful solution in Kashmir. The principles
included in the Lahore Declaration of Feb.1999 can provide, I believe,
the basis for a lasting solution which will bring peace and stability in
the region. In this context I would like to stress that Greece condemns
terrorism whatever its origin and positively considers the Indian initiative
for a U.N. Convention to combat International Terrorism. Furthermore, my
country has welcomed with satisfaction your initiative for a ceasefire
in the State of Jammu and Kashmir as well as its recent extension as announced
by your Excellency.
<p>I will take this opportunity to reiterate here my Government's position
concerning the U.N. reforms. I firmly believe that half a century after
the U.N.'s establishment, the Organization should reflect existing international
realities. As India plays an important regional and international role,
Greece supports your aspiration to become a permanent member of the enlarged
Security Council.
<p>Greece believes that India deserves a strong and privileged relationship
with the European Union. The existing Trade and Cooperation Agreement constitute
a solid basis. As an E.U. member state, Greece will actively contribute
to further enhance these relations, with decisive actions and concrete
programmes in order to increase economic exchanges, in the follow up of
the important E.U. India summit last year in Lisbon.
<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Prime Minister, distinguished guests,</font>
<p>In the Balkans, an important European region which experienced war and
suffering, Greece is striving to promote democracy, economic development,
and stability, both in cooperation with our E.U. partners as well as an
a bilateral basis. We have initiated, in 1997 in Crete, the South-Eastern
Europe Cooperation Process, which brings us at the same table with our
Balkan neighbours.
<p>I would like to mention, at this point the Cyprus issue. We highly appreciate
the position of India and its continuing contribution in this respect.
Cyprus marks considerable progress in its negotiations for accession to
the E.U. At the same time Greece has spared no effort to maintain the momentum
created during the recent rounds of proximity talks under the auspices
of the UN Secretary General. Our goal is a just, viable and comprehensive
solution of the Cyprus problem by establishing a bizonal, bicommunal Federation
as provided for in the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. Greek-Turkish
relations cannot go very far, if the present situation on the island remains
unchanged.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Prime Minister,</font>
<p>I believe it is hard to identify two countries that share more than
India and Greece do. The official visit to Athens of H.E. the President
of India, next April, will mark another, very significant moment in our
excellent relations. The Greek people along with President Stephanopoulos
and my Government are looking forward to giving him a warm reception.
<p>I raise my glass to the good health of President Narayanan and of yours,
Mr. Prime Minister.&nbsp;
<p>I raise my glass to India, a great Democracy and a great civilization.&nbsp;
<p>I raise my glass to the Indian people, wishing them peace, progress
and prosperity.</td>
