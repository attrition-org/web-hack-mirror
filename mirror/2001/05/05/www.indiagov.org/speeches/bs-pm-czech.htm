<td>Excellency,
<p>It is a great pleasure for me to warmly welcome you and the distinguished
members of your delegation.
<p>This first visit to India by a Czech Prime Minister is indeed a milestone
in our bilateral relations. Our discussions earlier today underlined the
shared interests and common values which have sustained our relationship,
unaffected by the political and economic changes in our two countries over
many decades.
<p>Our cultural and commercial relations go back to a period in history
when both our societies were striving to regain control over our destinies.
Intellectual exchanges between our scholars on linguistics, history and
culture were sustained by our Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and your Vincence
Lesny, who founded the Friends of India Association. Not long after that,
Bata Shoes and Jawa motorcycles became household names in India.
<p>The spirit of friendship which characterized that era lives on, and
was graphically demonstrated by the solidarity of the Czech government
and people with us during the recent earthquake in Gujarat. We greatly
appreciated your contribution.
<p>Excellency, our contemporary relationship is multidimensional and broad-based.
We need to constantly adapt it to meet the challenges of the rapidly changing
times. The sweeping changes in Czech society and India's economic liberalization
over the last decade have thrown up new opportunities to expand and diversify
our cooperation. Our discussions, and your delegation's interactions with
representatives of government and business. In India, have identified now
initiatives in our economic and commercial exchanges. We should work to
exploit their potential fully.
<p>Our political relations continue to be based on our commitment to Individual
freedoms, human dignity and respect for diversity and pluralism, These
shared aspirations a low us to work together also in multilateral forums
towards common objectives. We believe in a reform of the UN and its organs
to reflect current global realities. We are concerned about the destructive
impact of international terrorism. We deplore fanatical religious extremism
of the kind that led to the vandalism of the historical Bamiyan Buddhas
in Afghanistan a week ago.
<p>We are confident that, following your visit, our relations will attain
a qualitatively now level of cooperation and understanding.
<p>Ladles and Gentleman,&nbsp;
<p>I would now request you to join me in a toast to&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
the health of His Excellency Mr. Milos Zeman, Prime Minister of the Czech
Republic,&nbsp;</li>

<li>
the ever growing friendship between the peoples of the Czech Republic and
India and&nbsp;</li>

<li>
the further strengthening of the multifaceted cooperation between our two
countries.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Thank you.&nbsp;</td>
