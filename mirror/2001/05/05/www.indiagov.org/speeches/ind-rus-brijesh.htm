<td>India-Russia relations have several remarkable characteristics. They
have demonstrated a robust strength, withstanding major structural changes
in both the countries. Indo-Soviet relations moved almost seamlessly into
Indo-Russian relations, in spite of the post Cold War political and military
realignments and the upheavals caused by the breakdown of our economic
arrangements with the Soviet Union. We retained our mutuality of interests
and shared perceptions even in these totally changed circumstances. There
was, and remains, a national consensus in both countries on the fundamentals
of our bilateral relations. As President Putin said in India in October
last year, the two countries have never clashed even once nor has there
ever been any serious dispute or contradiction between us.
<p>A number of objective factors have shaped the congruence of outlook
and shared concerns which have determined the course of India-Russia relations:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
History evolves -continuously and politics is ever volatile, but geography
remains constant. There is a compelling geostrategic logic for close Indo-Russian
relations, which has been clearly grasped by every leadership of both our
countries, regardless of its political or economic ideology.</li>

<li>
The two countries have a common interest in the development of a multipolar
world based on a cooperative security order. In fact, even in the bipolar
construct of the Cold War, the development of India's relations with the
Soviet Union was perhaps one of the first expressions of multipolarity.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
We do not share a border, but we do share neighbours and a number of security
threats from across our borders. As President Putin pointed out in his
address to the Indian Parliament in October last year, the same individuals,
the same terrorist and extremist organizations are involved in terrorist
acts from the Philippines to Kosovo, including in Jammu &amp; Kashmir,
Afghanistan and Chechnya.. Sensitivity to each other's security concerns
has been an integral part of our relations. We understand Russia's real
security concerns in Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus and about the
destabilizing effects of undermining existing arms control and arms limitation
treaties. We receive the same understanding from Russia on our concerns.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Russia's "National Security Concept" of January 2000 and its "Foreign Policy
Concept" of June 2000 enunciate a worldview similar to that of India. We
share disquiet at insidious attempts to undermine sovereignty and to justify
intervention in the name of human rights, to encourage protectionism in
the guise of labour and environmental standards, and to impose alien sociocultural
conditions in the name of globalization.</li>

<li>
Neither country perceives a threat from the strength of the other. In fact,
each has a stake in the increased political and economic power of the other.
Uniquely, the undercurrent of competition or suspicion, often evident in
relations between two equal partners in such close geographical proximity,
is totally absent in the Indo-Russian equation. Russia's public and unequivocal
support for India's permanent membership of the UN Security Council is
only one illustration of this.</li>

<li>
The increasing political and economic importance of Asia has created a
new security matrix in which both India and Russia have crucial and complementary
interests. Asia does not have an institutional security framework like
that in Europe. Any Asian security framework can be sustained only with
strong inputs from India and Russia. The importance of Indo-Russian relations
for a stable security order in Asia is enhanced by the fact that both countries
have separately been steadily strengthening their bilateral relations with
other major powers - USA, EU, China, Japan, as well as Iran and Central
Asian, ASEAN, and West Asian countries. This web of bilateral relations
helps us to promote a cooperative security order rooted in pluralism.</li>

<li>
Over 500 years ago, a Russian traveller, Afanasy Nikitin, became the first
recorded European to set foot on Indian soil, over 25 years before Vasco
da Gama. He travelled along the land and sea route, which we today call
the North-South transport corridor. In September last year, India and Russia
signed an agreement on developing this corridor to promote bilateral trade
and other exchanges by reducing transport and transit costs. A cursory
glance at a Eurasian map would show that this corridor has more than an
economic significance.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
As two large and modernizing economies, we have similar perspectives on
the pace and direction of the globalization process. We have the complementarities
to exploit the opportunities created by economic liberalization and technology
diffusion to our mutual advantage.</li>
</ul>
Our close bilateral relations are serviced by intensive and sustained dialogue
at all levels. In implementation of the decision on annual summit meetings,
our Prime Minister will be going to Moscow later this year. Regular exchanges
are maintained between Foreign Ministries, Defence Ministries and our National
Security Councils.
<p>It is no secret that the two countries have had substantial military-technical
cooperation over many decades. A significant proportion of the military
equipment of our three armed services is of Russian (or Soviet) manufacture.
In recent years, our defence relations have moved from a mere buyer-seller
nexus towards joint research, development and manufacture.&nbsp;
<p>We place special emphasis on cooperation in the energy sector. This
is a crucial element in our goal of energy security. Indian companies hope
to enter the Russian oil industry through investments in Sakhalin. It is
the same objective that drives our cooperation in nuclear power: Russia
is collaborating in the construction of a 2 x 1000 MW nuclear power plant
in Kudankulam in Southern India.&nbsp;
<p>We acknowledge the underachievement in our bilateral trade, which has
an annual turnover of only about US $1.6 billion. Much of our trade is
through the rupee repayment track by which India repays the rouble debts
of the Soviet Union days. [Incidentally, among the countries with debts
to the former Soviet Union, India is the only one to have reached agreement
with Russia, fully addressing the debts]. The financial and banking crisis
in Russia in 1998, and the slowdown in our economy due to the Asian crisis
had some impact on our trade, but we have put them behind us. We are shifting
gradually from our traditional areas of economic interaction like power,
steel, coal and pharmaceuticals to areas like space, information technology,
robotics and oil exploration.
<p>Of course, I am not saying that we do not have our differences. But
we recognise and manage them with mutual understanding and without rancour.
We have our separate views on nuclear proliferation. During his visit to
India, President Putin expressed the hope that India would continue to
move toward a non-proliferation regime, taking into account its national
interests. Unlike other nuclear powers, Russia did not impose economic
sanctions or participate in indiscriminate technology denial regimes after
India's nuclear tests. This would have simply had the effect of throwing
out the baby of our flourishing civilian economic and technological cooperation
along with the bath water of proliferation concerns, which were, in any
event, unfounded. Russia also refrained from lecturing, hectoring, posturing
or offering gratuitous advice on the validity of our security concerns
and on how we should address them. I think this demonstrated the maturity
and depth in our relationship.&nbsp;
<p>It is this mature understanding of the mutuality of interests that inspired
our Declaration on Strategic Partnership, signed during President Putin's
recent visit to India. Strategic partnership is not a military alliance,
nor is it directed against any third country or group of countries. It
is a long-term perspective on bilateral relations, based both on geostrategic
realities and economic opportunities. It is a declaration of our solidarity
in the emerging political, economic and security scenario of the new millennium.</td>
