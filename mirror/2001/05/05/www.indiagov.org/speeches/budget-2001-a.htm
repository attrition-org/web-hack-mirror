<br>Sir,&nbsp;
<p>Sir, I rise to present the Budget for the year 2001-2002&nbsp;
<p>2. I do so in all humility. The challenges we face this year are awesome,
made more so by the tragedy and devastation caused by the Gujarat earthquake.
I hope I shall get the understanding and support of the whole House in
my endeavour to meet these challenges.&nbsp;
<p>3. The Indian economy has continued to exhibit both growth and resilience
that have characterized its performance in the past few years. Overall
economic growth this year is expected to be about 6 per cent despite a
series of unexpected setbacks. We have had a second successive year of
irregular monsoon resulting in low agricultural growth. World petroleum
prices have continued to stay at high levels placing strains on the economy
as a whole, and have led to a significant increase in inflation over the
past year. Fortunately, despite the increase in energy prices, the prices
of essential commodities, and of manufactured products as a whole, have
remained stable. Inflation, excluding energy, was around 4 per cent during
the year. The economy remained secure with record levels of foreign exchange
reserves and public food stocks. The creditable export performance recorded
last year improved further: exports grew by over 20 per cent in dollar
terms in April-December 2000.&nbsp;
<p>4. It is now 10 years since economic reforms began in 1991. During this
period, the economy has grown at an average rate of 6.4 per cent per year
since 1992-93 compared to the 5.8 per cent recorded in the 1980s. Poverty
has fallen from 36 per cent in 1993-94 to 26 per cent or less now.&nbsp;
<p>5. While economic reforms have placed the country on a much more secure
and sustained growth path, we still have some serious concerns and cannot
afford to be complacent.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Agricultural reforms have been inadequate and our agriculture continues
to be subject to the vagaries of the monsoon.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Despite major industrial sector reforms, industrial growth has not accelerated
to the double-digit level as expected.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Inadequate fiscal adjustment has remained the most intractable problem
over the past decade.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Interest payments now constitute over 69 per cent of the Centre’s tax revenues.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Subsidies continue to increase to unaffordable levels and do not necessarily
reach the deserving beneficiaries.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The pension liability of the Government is becoming onerous.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Public investment in infrastructure and social sectors is inadequate due
to falling total public sector savings.</li>

<li>
Private investment is constrained due to high real interest rates and inadequate
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
6. Thus, despite the many achievements of economic reforms over the past
decade, much remains to be done if we have to achieve our full potential.
There is urgent need to further deepen reforms to set the stage for higher
growth over the next decade. We have to intensify our effort in fiscal
adjustment so that the generations to come are not burdened by our borrowing
excesses. The economy has achieved significant acceleration in growth over
the last 20 years. Our aspiration must be to achieve still higher growth
in the next 20 years&nbsp;
<p>7. The broad strategy of the budget, therefore, with this objective
of growth in mind is to ensure:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Speeding up of agricultural sector reforms and better management of the
food economy.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Intensification of infrastructure investment, continued reform in the financial
sector and capital markets, and deepening of structural reforms through
removal of remaining tiresome controls constraining economic activity.</li>

<li>
Human development through better educational opportunities and programmes
of social security.</li>

<li>
Stringent expenditure control of non-productive expenditure, rationalisation
of subsidies and improvement in the quality of Government expenditure.</li>

<li>
Acceleration of the privatisation process and restructuring of public enterprises.</li>

<li>
Revenue enhancement through widening of the tax base and administration
of a fair and equitable tax regime.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<b><u><font color="#990000">Agriculture and Rural Development</font></u></b>
<p>8. As I have noted, reforms in the agriculture sector have been inadequate
and must be speeded up. The Government has already announced the first
ever National Policy in Agriculture.&nbsp;
<p>9. The provision of adequate credit flow is critical for agricultural
production. Total credit flow to agriculture through institutional channels
of commercial banks, cooperative banks and regional rural banks is estimated
to have reached a level of Rs 51,500 crore this year, an increase of about
15 per cent over last year. It is expected to increase to Rs 64,000 crore
in 2001-2002 representing an increase of 24 per cent. In order to ensure
continued healthy growth of the agricultural sector, I propose the following
steps:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The operation of the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF), set
up in 1995-96 with NABARD, has been very successful in upgrading rural
infrastructure with about 1,84,000 projects sanctioned so far. To help
the States, I have decided to reduce the interest rate charged by NABARD
from 11.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The corpus of RIDF VII will be increased
from Rs 4500 crore to Rs 5000 crore next year.</li>

<li>
The innovation of Kisan Credit Cards has proved to be very successful.
Since the year of its introduction in 1998-99, almost 110 lakh of KCCs
have been issued. I am asking our banks to accelerate this programme and
cover all eligible agricultural farmers within the next 3 years.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
I am also asking the banks to provide a personal insurance package to the
KCC holders, as is often done with other credit cards, to cover them against
accidental death or permanent disability, upto maximum amount of Rs 50,000
and Rs 25,000 respectively. The premium burden will be shared by the card
issuing institutions.</li>

<li>
NABARD and SIDBI were asked to link one lakh Self-Help Groups during the
current year. NABARD by itself is well poised to exceed this target by
the end of next month. I expect NABARD to link 1 lakh additional Self Help
Groups during 2001-02, which would help in providing access to credit to
an additional 20 lakh families. Share-croppers and tenant farmers will
also become eligible for this scheme and special attention will be given
to SC/ST groups. A micro finance development fund has also been set up
in NABARD with contribution of Rs 40 crore each by NABARD and RBI.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
I had permitted NABARD to issue capital gains tax exemption bonds last
year. This has helped NABARD to mobilise more than Rs 1000 crore at lower
than normal interest rates thereby reducing its cost of funds. I propose
to continue with this tax exemption.</li>

<li>
The resources from the Watershed Development Fund set up in NABARD would
be used to promote people’s participation and also enable water users’
associations to implement, operate and maintain irrigation schemes.</li>
</ul>
10. In 1999, I had announced a credit linked subsidy scheme for construction
of cold storages for perishable commodities. So far, NABARD and NCDC have
provided Rs 161 crore of credit for creation of additional capacity of
9.69 lakh tonnes. A subsidy of Rs 78 crore for setting up these cold storages
was provided during 2000-2001. I now propose to extend the coverage of
this scheme to also cover rural godowns. The subsidy to be provided by
the Government would be suitably enhanced to take care of increased coverage.
The loans would carry an adequate long-term repayment period and would
enable individuals, cooperative societies and others to build godowns by
availing of loans from cooperative banks, commercial banks and RRBs&nbsp;
<p>11. This scheme will enable small farmers to enhance their holding capacity
in order to sell their produce at remunerative prices. NABARD proposes
to reduce its rate of interest for funding the storage of crops, from 10
per cent to 8.5 per cent. Small farmers will particularly benefit from
this scheme by avoiding distress sales.&nbsp;
<p>12. With the diversification and modernisation of agricultural practices,
there is a need to augment support and extension services for agriculture.
For this purpose, a scheme for setting up Agriclinics and Agribusiness
Centres by agricultural graduates will be launched with the support of
NABARD. These centres will provide a package of soil and input testing
facilities and other consultancy services, They will strengthen transfer
of technology and extension services and also provide self-employment opportunities
to technically trained persons. Loans on attractive terms for setting up
these centres will be provided by banks with refinance from NABARD.&nbsp;
<p>13. There is a significant potential of improving crop productivity
in the Eastern and North Eastern regions through crop diversification and
adoption of improved technologies. These regions also have large untapped
ground water resources. A sum of Rs 61 crore has been provided for the
Centrally Sponsored Scheme on "On-Farm Water Management for Increasing
Crop Production in Eastern India".&nbsp;
<p>14. I am also happy to inform the House that I have provided Rs 38 crore
for the "Technology Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture
in the North-Eastern States", announced by me last year.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Rural Boards</font></u></b>
<p>15. In my last Budget, I had announced the launching of a new scheme,
the Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana (PMGY) with the objective of undertaking
time bound programmes to fulfill the critical needs of the rural people.
As a follow up, particularly with the objective of achieving rural connectivity,
the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has been launched by the Hon’ble Prime
Minister on December 25, 2000. A Central allocation of Rs 2500 crore was
provided for 2000-01. I am providing another allocation of Rs 2500 crore
for the coming year. 50 per cent of the diesel cess is earmarked for development
of rural roads.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Rural Electrification</font></u></b>
<p>16. It is a matter of concern that even after 50 years of planned development
there are still about 80,000 villages, which do not have access to electricity.
A package of initiatives is therefore being launched to improve the power
distribution system in rural areas. This includes:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Completion of electrification of bulk of the remaining villages in the
next 6 years.</li>

<li>
Extension of assistance to the States for village electrification works
under the PMGY whose funding is being augmented.</li>

<li>
Stepping up credit support from Rural Electrification Corporation to SEBs
for speedy electrification of dalit bastis, households of scheduled tribes
and other weaker sections of society.</li>

<li>
Improving the quality of power supply in villages, augmentation of distribution
networks in rural areas supported by REC under the Accelerated Power Development
Programme.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Earmarking a sum of at least Rs 750 crore out of RIDF for rural electrification
works.</li>

<li>
Augmenting the resources of REC, by allowing it to float capital gains
tax exemption bonds along with NABARD and NHAI under Section 54 EC of the
Income Tax Act.</li>
</ul>
<b><u><font color="#990000">Management of the Food Economy</font></u></b>
<p>17. Increased production and rising productivity makes the proper management
of the food economy more critical then ever before. Our policy has to be
transformed to deal with surpluses rather than only shortages. The present
arrangement of Government of India procuring foodgrains and States managing
the PDS has led to many problems. While the subsidy has increased from
Rs 8210 crore at B.E. to Rs 12,125 crore at R.E. stage this year, the satisfaction
level has gone down. I propose, therefore, to give an enlarged role to
the State Governments in both procurement and distribution of foodgrains
for PDS in their respective states. Instead of providing subsidised foodgrains,
financial assistance will be provided to the State Governments to enable
them to procure and distribute foodgrains to BPL families at subsidised
rates. FCI will continue to procure foodgrains for maintaining food security
reserves and for such State Governments who will assign it this task on
their behalf. Details for operationalising these arrangements will be worked
out in consultation with the State Governments at the earliest.&nbsp;
<p>18. The agricultural sector continues to be constrained by the existence
of a number of inhibiting controls and regulations. The Essential Commodities
Act, 1955 provides for the control of production, supply and distribution
of certain commodities identified as essential commodities under the Act
to protect the interest of consumers. State Governments have issued a large
number of Control Orders under this Act inhibiting free movement of some
food and agriculture products. In the changed present situation undue restrictions
on movement and stocking of foodgrains and agricultural produce is acting
as a disincentive to farmers.&nbsp;
<p>19. Government therefore proposes to review the operation of the Essential
Commodities Act, 1955 and&nbsp; remove many of the restrictions that have
been imposed on the free inter-State movement of foodgrains and agricultural
produce and also on the storage and stocking of such commodities. It will
also review the list of commodities declared as essential under the said
Act and bring their number down to the minimum required. My colleague the
Food Minister will issue necessary direction in this regard after consultations
with the State Governments.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Infrastructure</font></u></b>
<p>20. Rapid development of the economy depends on adequate investment
in infrastructure. A key issue here is imposition of appropriate user charges
necessary to provide adequate returns on investment. Public resources have
been invested in the public sector over the last 50 years for the provision
of infrastructure services in the country. One consequence of this has
been that user charges have inevitably become politically determined. Over
time non-merit subsidies inherent in such low user charges have mounted
to over 10 per cent of GDP, a figure similar to the total fiscal deficit
of the Central and State Governments combined. Hence they are a major cause
of the fiscal distress being experienced at all levels&nbsp;
<p>21. I believe that this issue is now so important that it needs urgent
discussion throughout the country. The challenge is to achieve a consensus
on the imposition of appropriate user charges in such a manner that the
poor are protected while those who can pay are made to do so. Only then
will we be able to accelerate investment in these essential services in
both the public and private sectors. A prime example of this is the power
sector.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Power</font></u></b>
<p>22. The importance of power in fuelling economic growth cannot be over
emphasised. The total cost to the State Electricity Boards of implicit
subsidies amounts to about Rs 36,000 crore this year. After accounting
for cross subsidy and State subventions, actual commercial losses of all
SEBs combined are estimated to be about Rs 24,000 crore. Hidden in these
loss figures are extremely high T&amp;D losses.&nbsp;
<p>23 Although all of these losses are borne by SEBs and State Governments,
I have to express my concern on this issue since this is a massive national
loss and affects Central Government undertakings also. The total dues owed
to Central Government utilities by SEBs and others now amount to over Rs
25,000 crore. If these resources were available, the country would have
no difficulty in investing adequately in power sector expansion to the
benefit of all. Theft of electricity must be stopped and economic tariffs
levied.&nbsp;
<p>24. The most vital element of the reform process is the restoration
of financial viability of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs). On the basis
of consensus that has progressively emerged in the National Development
Council Resolution of 1992, the Common Minimum National Action Programme
drawn up in 1996 and the Power Ministers’ Conference of February 2000,
the Central Government is accelerating the programme of reforms in SEBs
on the basis of specific milestones that are being built into MOUs entered
into with State Governments. These MOUs include specific milestones such
as:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
A time bound programme for installation of 100 per cent metering by December
2001.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Energy audit at all levels.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
A specific programme for reduction and eventual elimination of power theft.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Tariff determination by SERCs and compliance thereof.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Commercialisation of distribution and</li>

<li>
SEB restructuring.</li>
</ul>
To demonstrate the importance of this task, the Prime Minister will hold
a meeting of State Chief Ministers on March 3, 2001.&nbsp;
<p>25. MOUs have already been entered into with 5 States and we expect
more States to adopt the reform process. Accordingly, plan allocation to
the Accelerated Power Development Programme (APDP) has been stepped up
to Rs 1500 crore next year from a level of Rs 1000 crore this year. Priority
under APDP would be given to those states that undertake such reform. The
key to restoration of financial viability is reform of distribution. Assistance
from the Fiscal Reform Incentive Fund recommended by the 11th Finance Commission
would also, inter-alia, be linked to the achievement of power reforms.
The reforming States would also receive support from the Central Government
in form of preferential allocation of power to SEBs from CPSUs, additional
investment by CPSUs in generation and transmission, and preferential allocation
of external aid.&nbsp;
<p>26. In order to help accelerate the reform process in the power sector
and to unify all existing central legislations in the sector, my colleague
the Minister for Power will introduce the Electricity Bill 2001 within
this session.&nbsp;
<p>27. The Plan outlay for central sector power utilities is being raised
from Rs 9,194 crore this year to Rs 10,030 crore for 2001-02. This demonstrates
the commitment of the Central Government to accelerate public sector power
investment along with power sector reforms.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Roads</font></u></b>
<p>28. The National Highway Development Programme (NHDP) represents a new
road vision for this country. Its unprecedented scale is symbolic of government’s
earnestness to provide connectivity and mobility of an altogether different
order. The key to government’s success in accelerating the road development
programme lies in its bold policy of levying a cess on petrol and diesel
as a user charge for road usage. Resources for Phase I, to be completed
by December 2003, have already been tied up. Work has already been awarded
for more than 1500 Kms. of the golden quadrilateral in addition to the
completed sections totalling 600 Kms. The balance portion is expected to
be awarded by the middle of this year.&nbsp;
<p>29. The cess has paved the way for integrated road development in the
country, including village roads, district roads, state roads, and national
highways. Rs 962 crore from the cess fund is being made available to States
for state roads. The total plan outlay for this sector is being enhanced
by 93 per cent to Rs 8727 crore in 2001-02.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Telecom</font></u></b>
<p>30. Another area of success is in the telecommunications sector. Almost
all the policy measures announced in the New Telecom Policy 1999 regarding
basic and cellular services, national long distance, Internet services,
and corporatisation of Department of Telecom Services have been implemented.
Competition is being introduced in all service segments.&nbsp;
<p>31. By March 2001, overall teledensity is expected to reach 3.5 per
hundred, about double the teledensity of only two years ago. Moreover,
the new competition has already reduced prices for consumers. There are
now almost 800,000 STD/ISD/Local booths around the country bringing telephone
service within reach of almost all consumers, apart from generating considerable
employment.&nbsp;
<p>32. Looking ahead, having recognised the imperatives of technological
change in this area, the Government proposes to introduce the Convergence
Bill to cover telecommunications, information technology, and information
and broadcasting sectors in an integrated manner.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Ports</font></u></b>
<p>33. Coming to the port sector, I am glad to report that policy initiatives
designed to increase private sector participation in ports have also been
successfully implemented. Overall, capacity in Indian major ports is expected
to go up to 314 million tonnes this year and further to 376 million tonnes
by the end of 2001-2002, along with substantial capacity addition in minor
ports. There is now adequate capacity in major ports. Ships no longer have
to wait for berths as was the case before.&nbsp;
<p>34. Ennore port has already been corporatised and Jawahar Lal Nehru
Port in New Mumbai is next, and with experience, other major ports can
also be corporatized, enabling them to raise resources in the market. Successful
investment is being enabled by the setting of economic tariff levels. With
the formation of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, these tariffs are
being rationalised further on a continuing transparent and fair basis.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Financial Sector and Capital Markets</font></u></b>
<p>35. A great deal of progress has been made over the last few years in
pursuing reforms in the financial sector and capital markets. I propose
to continue reform in this sector.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Debt Market</font></u></b>
<p>36. The Indian equity market is the oldest in Asia. Since the creation
of SEBI much greater transparency as well as automaticity has been introduced
in the working of the equity market. The need now is to develop and deepen
the debt market. This will be of great benefit to small investors and institutional
investors alike. The infrastructure sector will be enabled to raise long
term funds, particularly with the opening of the insurance sector.&nbsp;
<p>37. In order to further develop a transparent and active debt market
in general, and the Government securities market in particular, I propose
to take the following measures:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
A Clearing Corporation will be set up under the active encouragement of
the RBI, with State Bank of India as the chief promoter, and is expected
to be in place by June 2001. It will also enable settlement of forex transactions.</li>

<li>
Trading of Government Securities, through order driven screen-based system
will be implemented.</li>

<li>
An electronic Negotiated Dealing System will be set up by the RBI by June
2001 to facilitate transparent electronic bidding in auctions and dealings
in Government securities on a real time basis.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
In order to ensure smooth and quick movement of funds, the Electronic Fund
Transfer (EFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement Systems (RTGS) are being
put in place by the Reserve Bank of India within the next year.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Clarifications are being issued by CBDT to promote the issuance of STRIPS,
zero coupon bonds, deep discount bonds, and the like.</li>

<li>
The old Public Debt Act will be replaced by Government Securities Act.</li>

<li>
Comprehensive legislation will be introduced on securitization.</li>
</ul>
38. I propose to set up a small group comprising the Reserve Bank of India,
SEBI, the stock exchanges and Ministry of Finance to monitor and implement
these developments so that the debt market becomes active next year.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Banking Sector</font></u></b>
<p>39. Banking sector reforms have proceeded apace in a phased manner over
the past decade. However, the problem of non-performing assets with banks
has continued. Special attention is being paid to recovery of NPAs:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Public Sector Banks have recovered Rs 800 crore of NPAs from 2 lakh accounts
in 2000-01.</li>

<li>
Net NPAs as percentage of net advances were almost half at 7.4 per cent
in 1999-2000 compared to 14.5 per cent in 1993-94.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
22 Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and 5 Appellate Tribunals have been established.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
7 more DRTs will be set up during 2001-02.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
40. I also propose to bring in a legislation that will facilitate foreclosure
and enforcement of securities in cases of default in order to enable the
intitutions to realise their dues.&nbsp;
<p>41. In the light of new competition in the banking industry it is necessary
to strengthen the management of the public sector banks. I propose to provide
greater autonomy to bank managements. It is also essential to provide greater
independence to bank managements in forming their own recruitment strategy
and in implementing it. I therefore propose to abolish the Banking Services
Recruitment Boards. This will be done in association with the Reserve Bank
of India by July 31, 2001 or earlier. All future recruitments will be done
by banks themselves.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Capital Account Liberalisation</font></u></b>
<p>42. Until about 10 years ago, all foreign exchange transactions were
tightly controlled by the government and by the RBI. We have progressively
loosened these controls and made the current account completely convertible.
We have also liberalised the capital account for certain purposes. I propose
to take further measures for liberalising the capital account. These are:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Indian companies wishing to invest abroad may now invest up to US $50 million
on an annual basis through the automatic route without being subject to
the three year profitability condition.</li>

<li>
Companies which have issued ADRs/GDRs may henceforth make foreign investments
up to 100 per cent of these proceeds; up from the current ceiling of 50
per cent.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Companies with proven track record wishing to invest larger amounts may
now get a block allocation in advance from the RBI for investments overseas.</li>

<li>
Indian companies that have issued ADRs/GDRs may acquire shares of foreign
companies up to an amount of US $100 million or an amount equivalent to
ten times of their exports in a year, whichever is higher.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
ADRs/GDRs will be provided two-way fungibility. Converted local shares
may be reconverted to ADRs/GDRs while being subject to sectoral caps, wherever
applicable.</li>

<li>
Indian companies will now be permitted to list in foreign stock exchanges
by sponsoring ADR/GDR issues against block share holding. This facility
would have to be offered to all categories of shareholders.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The Reserve Bank of India will be issuing these guidelines separately.</li>
</ul>
43. Investments by Registered partnership firms and companies providing
professional services have not, so far, been permitted to make overseas
investments. This ban is now being removed. Similarly, Indian employees
who have the benefit of ESOP schemes in foreign owned companies can now
make investments abroad up to US $20,000 annually instead of in a block
of 5 years.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Foreign Investment</font></u></b>
<p>44. Progressive liberalization has taken place in the provisions relating
to foreign investment. I propose to take the following further measures:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) can invest in a company under the
portfolio investment route up to 24 per cent of the paid up capital of
the company. This can be increased to 40 per cent with the approval of
the General Body of the shareholders by a special resolution. I propose
to increase this limit to 49 per cent.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)
is permitted on a case by case basis upto 100 per cent but with a condition
that a minimum of 25 per cent of their holding is divested in the domestic
market. This condition is being removed, provided the foreign investors
bring in a minimum of US $50 million. FDI in NBFCs will now be put on the
automatic route subject to RBI guidelines.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<b><u><font color="#990000">Structural Reforms</font></u></b>
<p>45. In order to accelerate growth in the Indian economy, we have now
to address some of the difficult areas of reform that have not been tackled
so far.&nbsp;
<p>46. There are four significant areas where a price and distribution
control regime exists. These are the areas of petroleum, fertilizer, sugar
and drugs.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM)</font></u></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Petroleum</font></u></b>
<p>47. As Hon’ble Members are aware, Government had, in November 1997,
notified the details of dismantling of the Administered Pricing Mechanism
(APM) in the petroleum sector by March 2002. I propose to adhere to this
deadline. A time bound action programme is being prepared for the deregulation
of APM by March, 2002. My colleague the Minister of Petroleum and Natural
Gas will be outlining the road map for this separately.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Fertilizer</font></u></b>
<p>48. Hon’ble Members will recall that I have in the past referred to
the rationalisation of fertilizer pricing with the objective of phasing
out the existing retention price scheme (RPS) in the medium-term. Government
has now decided to implement the recommendations of the Expenditure Reforms
Commission for a phased programme of complete decontrol of urea by April
1, 2006. The following steps would be taken in the first phase commencing
from April 1, 2001:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The unit specific RPS will be replaced by a Group Concession Scheme. The
current MRP arrangement will be continued and the concession for each group
calibrated to enable the units to sell urea at the stipulated MRP.</li>

<li>
The rate of concession for urea units based on naphtha/FO/LSHS will be
linked to international prices of these feed stocks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<b><u><font color="#990000">Sugar</font></u></b>
<p>49. Government is committed to complete decontrol of sugar. But this
must be irreversible. Government has decided to introduce futures/forward
trading in sugar within the coming year, a step that is necessary before
full decontrol. Sugar under the Public Distribution System will continue
to be supplied to ration cardholders in the special category states, hill
states, island territories and to BPL families in other states and UTs.
Such supplies can even continue after sugar is completely decontrolled.
The retail issue price of sugar under the PDS is being revised to Rs 13.25
per kg. with effect from March 1, 2001.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Drug Price Control</font></u></b>
<p>50. The domestic drugs and pharmaceutical industry needs support in
order to meet the challenges and to avail of the opportunities arising
out of liberalisation of our economy and the impending advent of the product
patent regime. Government has been considering measures to lessen the rigours
of the present price control mechanism where they have become counter productive.
Towards this end, we have decided that the span of price control will be
reduced substantially. However, keeping in view the interest of the weaker
sections of society, Government will retain the power to intervene comprehensively
in cases where prices behave abnormally. Changes in the Pharmaceutical
Policy are being made accordingly.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Industrial Restructuring</font></u></b>
<p>51. Government had constituted a high level committee on law relating
to revival, reconstruction and/or winding up of companies. The Committee
has submitted its report and Government has accepted its key recommendations.
It is proposed to repeal the SICA and also to amend the Companies Act in
order to set up a National Company Law Tribunal. These legislative proposals
are proposed to be introduced during the current session by my colleague,
the Minister for Law, Justice and Company Affairs.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Labour Market</font></u></b>
<p>52. Along with these changes, it is also necessary to address the contentious
issue of rigidities in our labour legislations. Some existing provisions
in the Industrial Disputes Act have made it almost impossible for industrial
firms to exercise any labour flexibility. The Government is now convinced
that some change is necessary in this legislation. Chapter VB of the ID
Act stipulates that employers in specified industrial establishments must
obtain prior approval of the appropriate government authority for effecting
lay-off, retrenchment and closure, after following the prescribed procedure.
It is proposed that these provisions may now apply to industrial establishments
employing not less than 1000 workers instead of 100. The separation compensation
will be increased from 15 days to 45 days for every completed year of service.
The enhancement of compensation would act as a deterrent on employers to
take recourse to lay-off, retrenchment and closure in a routine manner.&nbsp;
<p>53. Similarly, rigidities inherent in the existing legislation regarding
Contract Labour inhibit growth in employment in many service activities.
Section 10 of the existing Act envisages prohibition of contract labour
in work/process/operation if the conditions set therein like perennial
nature of job etc. are fulfilled. Section 10 enables the contract labour
engaged in prohibited jobs to become direct employees of the principal
employer. To overcome this difficulty and at the same time ensure the protection
of labour, it is proposed to bring an amendment to facilitate outsourcing
of activities without any restrictions as well as to offer contract appointments.
It would not differentiate between core and non-core activities, and provide
protection to labour engaged in outsourced activities in terms of their
health, safety, welfare, social security, etc. It would also provide for
larger compensation based on last drawn wages as retrenchment compensation
for every year of service.&nbsp;
<p>54. These measures will promote industrial investment in labour intensive,
and export oriented activities providing for renewed industrial growth,
while, at the same time safeguarding the interest of workers. My colleague,
the Minister for Labour will introduce appropriate legislation to amend
the Industrial Disputes Act and Contract Labour Act within this session.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Ashraya Bima Yojana</font></u></b>
<p>55. I am conscious of the short-term impact on organized labour force
of the on-going liberalization of the economy. I therefore propose to introduce
a new scheme of group insurance viz. "Ashraya Bima Yojana" to extend security
cover to such affected workers. The policy will provide compensation of
up to 30 per cent of last drawn annual pay for a period of one year to
workers who lose their jobs. It is proposed that the policy will initially
cover all employees drawing a salary up to Rs 10,000 per month. The four
Government owned general insurance companies will administer this policy
on a "No Profit No Loss" basis and will announce full details including
premium rates of the proposed policy by the end of June 2001.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Small Scale Industries</font></u></b>
<p>56. Government’s commitment to the Small Scale sector has been repeatedly
demonstrated. A comprehensive policy package for this sector was announced
by the Prime Minister on 30, August, 2000.&nbsp;
<p>57. In order to encourage production and employment in this sector,
the exemption limit has been doubled to Rs 1 crore from September 1, 2000&nbsp;
<p>58. The new Credit Guarantee Scheme of August 2000 has been provided
budgetary support of Rs 100 crore in the current year. The limit of loan
without collateral which was earlier fixed at Rs 10 lakh has been raised
to Rs 25 lakh under this scheme. Already 7 banks have entered into an agreement
with the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust that has been created to implement
the scheme. A credit linked capital subsidy scheme for technology upgradation
was launched in October 2000 envisaging 12 per cent capital subsidy. It
is expected that loans to the extent of Rs 5000 crore would be made available
to the SSI sector over the next 5 years under the scheme.&nbsp;
<p>59. Our small-scale entrepreneurs have proved their competitiveness
in providing over 35 per cent of national exports. To enable further new
investment and technology upgradation in some of the key export oriented
sectors, it is now proposed to dereserve another 14 items related to leather
goods, shoes and toys&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Textiles</font></u></b>
<p>60. The Government has recently announced a New Textile Policy aimed
at preparing industry for the new challenges of global competition. I am
happy to announce a textile package comprising the following schemes:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
A scheme for setting up Integrated Apparel Parks is being initiated. This
will enable the dereserved readymade garment industry to set up modern
units with the best infrastructure. A budget provision of Rs 10 crore has
been provided for the year 2001-02.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
A strong and modern weaving sector is very critical for this purpose. At
least 50,000 new shuttleless looms and the modernisation of 2.5 lakh plain
looms to automatic looms is expected to take place by 2004 through funding
from the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS). The budget provision
under TUFS is being raised from Rs 50 crore this year to Rs 200 crore in
the next year.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The Cotton Technology Mission is being continued and strengthened. The
budget provision is being increased from Rs 15 crore to Rs 25 crore.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The budget allocation for Ministry of Textiles is being enhanced substantially
from Rs 457 crore in 2000-01 to Rs 650 crore in 2001-02.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
I shall provide the details of the proposed fiscal changes in Part B of
my speech.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<b><u><font color="#990000">Human Development</font></u></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Health and Family Welfare</font></u></b>
<p>61. Recognizing the need for increasing investments in social sectors,
the Plan allocation for the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare has
been stepped up from Rs 4920 crore to Rs 5780 crore. This includes an allocation
of Rs 180 crore for HIV/Aids Control Programme.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Indian System of Medicine</font></u></b>
<p>62. There is now a great interest worldwide in herbal products as people
look for gentler forms of treatment devoid of side effects. We are establishing
a Traditional Knowledge Digital Liberary to bring the knowledge already
in the public domain in international languages to prevent the grant of
patents. We are also introducing a new scheme for strengthening the State
Drug Testing Laboratories and pharmacies. We propose to provide Indian
Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy benefits similar to the pharmaceutical
industry.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Education</font></u></b>
<p>63. An integrated National Education Programme – the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan
has been launched for universalising elementary education and a National
Mission constituted with the Prime Minister as Chairman. The programme
aims to provide eight years of quality elementary education for all children
upto the age of 14 years in a Mission mode with a thrust on community ownership,
disadvantaged group and girls’ quality education and alternative modes
of education. All existing schemes on elementary education will converge
with this scheme after the Ninth Plan and it will cover all districts in
the country by March, next year.&nbsp;
<p>64. We are determined to maintain and strengthen our competitiveness
in the field of technology education. A task force set up for this purpose
under the HRD Minister has made wide ranging recommendations to upgrade
and expand this area of education, The Roorkee Engineering College will
be upgraded in to an IIT and funding for IIT, Guwahati has been stepped
up to ensure its early completion. The base of IITs is to be expanded,
regional engineering colleges are to be strengthened and new institutes
will be set up with public private partnership. The role of the private
sector will be encouraged. A new Centrally Sponsored Scheme for computer
literacy and studies in schools is being launched and other initiatives
planned for encouraging IT education from school to college levels.&nbsp;
<p>65. Last year, I announced the availability of 100 per cent deduction
from income tax of payments made to institutions for vocational education
and training by the private sector set up in rural areas and small towns.
I propose to make the same deduction available for payments to engineering
institutions also.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Educational Loans for Students</font></u></b>
<p>66. Mr Speaker Sir, I have personally experienced poverty and faced
problems in pursuing higher studies. I, therefore, feel that no deserving
student in the country should be deprived of higher and technical education
for want of finances. I am glad that the Indian Banks Association (IBA)
has formulated a new comprehensive Educational Loan Scheme, which will
cover all courses in schools and colleges in India and abroad. Loans will
be available under this scheme up to Rs 7.5 lakh for studies in India,
and Rs 15 lakh for studies abroad. No collateral or margin will be stipulated
for loans up to Rs 4 lakh, the interest of which will not exceed the prime
lending rate (PLR). The interest rate will not exceed PLR plus 1 per cent
for loans above Rs 4 lakh. The loans would be repaid over a period of 5
to 7 years with provision of a grace period. I hope that this scheme will
enable needy children to pursue higher and technical studies both inside
and outside India&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Women</font></u></b>
<p>67. The year 2001 is being observed as Women’s Empowerment Year. My
colleague, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission is heading a
Task Force to review the programmes for women. Meanwhile I propose to:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Strengthen the Rashtriya Mahila Kosh for providing micro credit to poor
assetless women through NGOs.</li>

<li>
Launch an integrated scheme for women’s empowerment in 650 blocks through
women’s self help groups.</li>

<li>
Start a new scheme for women in difficult circumstances like widows of
Vrindavan, Kashi and other places, destitute women and other disadvantaged
women groups</li>
</ul>
69. Similarly, the allocation for the schemes for welfare and upliftment
of scheduled castes in the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment
has been enhanced from Rs 709 crore this year to Rs 790 crore in the coming
year.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Social Security</font></u></b>
<p>70. Hon’ble Members may recall my announcement in the last budget, of
a new Group Insurance Scheme, the "Janashree Bima Yojana" to extend Social
Security cover to the poorest sections of society. The said scheme was
launched by the Prime Minister on 10, August, 2000 and has been well received.
332 schemes have been approved so far covering 99,750 people in the BPL
segment.&nbsp;
<p>71. I believe that the Social Security cover needs to be widened to
minimize the miseries of our people below the poverty line. Accordingly,
I propose to introduce two more schemes during the next financial year:&nbsp;
<p>(i) A special scheme for landless agricultural labourers, the Khetihar
Mazdoor Bima Yojana, which will provide benefits of insurance cover as
available under Janashree Bima Yojana and a pension of Rs 100 per month,
to the beneficiary on attaining the age of 60 years. In the case of beneficiaries
who join the scheme at a young age, some periodical payments at the end
of every ten years are also envisaged. The beneficiaries will be required
to make a small contribution towards the premium.&nbsp;
<p>(ii) A Shiksha Sahyog Yojana, to provide an education allowance of Rs
100 per month to the children of parents living below the poverty line,
to meet the expenses of education during their studies from 9th to 12th
standard, so that a needy student is not deprived of the opportunity to
continue his/her education for want of funds. This will be available to
subscribers of the Janashree Bima Yojana.&nbsp;
<p>These schemes will be managed by LIC.&nbsp;
<p>72. Meanwhile, I have some good news for workers. The wage ceiling for
coverage under the EPF and MP Act, 1952 has been enhanced from Rs 5000
to Rs 6500. To promote the welfare of employees I propose to enhance the
ceiling for Government contribution of 1.16 per cent of monthly wage of
employees to the Pension Fund from Rs 5000 to Rs 6000 per month. The extra
expenditure on this account is estimated to be Rs 77 crore per annum.&nbsp;
<p>73. Whereas the organised sector is at present covered by various pension,
provident fund and gratuity schemes, the unorganised sector does not have
adequate social security coverage. I am asking the Insurance Regulatory
Development Authority to look into all these issues and provide a road
map for pension reforms by October 1, 2001.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Journalists Welfare Fund</font></u></b>
<p>74. Journalists have to increasingly take greater risks in covering
terrorist and other violence prone incidents. As an acknowledgement of
their services and sacrifices, and with the expectation of a better treatment
at their hands, I propose to set up a Journalists Welfare Fund with a contribution
of Rs 1 crore under the grants of Ministry of I&amp;B. My colleague the
I&amp;B Minister will announce the details of the scheme.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Entertainment</font></u></b>
<p>75. Our entertainment industry, particularly the film industry not only
provides the much needed fantasy to millions of our people who live in
an otherwise harsh and cruel world, it has also emerged as an important
segment of our economy and holds great promise for the future. Two years
ago, I provided for this industry the same tax exemption that was available
for merchandise exports. A few months ago, the Government issued a notification
under the IDBI Act whereby entertainment industry including films has been
declared as an industrial concern. Banks are in the process of finalising
guidelines for financing such projects that are bankable. I hope that the
film industry will take full advantage of these measures to bring about
a
greater degree of professionalism and transparency in its operations, and
will not do things chupke chupke and certainly not chori chori.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Fiscal Consolidation</font></u></b>
<p>76. As I have already stated the most serious problem confronting the
economy is the poor state of the fiscal health of both the Central and
State Governments. The combined fiscal deficit of the two together is in
the region of 10 per cent of GDP. I have often been described as a fiscal
fundamentalist. Some have gone to the extent of calling me a fiscal terrorist.
Why am I so concerned about the fiscal deficit? Let me try to explain.
The total receipts of the Central Government in the current year according
to BE are about Rs 281,000 crore. Of this amount, Rs 72,000 crore is States’
share of the Central taxes and grants. The Central Government is, therefore,
left with Rs 209,000 crore. On the expenditure side, about Rs 101,000 crore
was to be spent on interest,&nbsp;
<br>Rs 59,000 crore on defence, Rs 23,000 crore on major subsidies and
Rs 16,000 crore on pensions. The net amount left for meeting all other
Government expenditure totalling Rs 123,000 crore was, therefore, only
Rs 12,000 crore. I have, therefore, to borrow Rs 111,000 crore in the current
year to make both ends meet. The most worrisome aspect is that over 70
per cent of my borrowing, i.e., Rs 77,000 crore was for financing unproductive
revenue expenditure. This will add to my interest burden next year forcing
me to borrow more and ultimately fall into a debt trap. I am deeply conscious
of the burden which is being placed on future generations, by our extravagance.
I cannot allow this situation to continue.&nbsp;
<p>77. As promised in my earlier Budget Speeches, I appointed the Expenditure
Reforms Commission last year and introduced the Fiscal Responsibility Bill
in this House in the last session. The bill seeks to reduce the fiscal
deficit to 2 per cent and completely eliminate the revenue deficit over
the next five years&nbsp;
<p>78. A number of initiatives have already been taken to contain, in particular,
the growth of non-plan expenditure. I have not allowed any increase in
non-plan expenditure this year. Consequently, for the first time in many
years, the fiscal deficit target fixed in the budget has indeed been achieved,
and remains at 5.1 per cent in the RE of the current year. The target of
3.6 per cent revenue deficit has also been achieved.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Expenditure Management</font></u></b>
<p>79. I intend to carry forward the process of bringing about structural
changes in the composition of Central Government expenditure and effect
economy in non-plan revenue expenditure with greater vigour while improving
the quality of plan expenditure. For this, I propose to take the following
initiatives:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
User charges for services provided by government and its agencies will
be revised keeping in view the increased cost of these services. A portion
of this increase will be provided to enhance the maintenance and quality
of these services.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Similarly, postal rates will be revised moderately to contain the rising
postal deficit.</li>

<li>
All requirements of recruitment will be scrutinized to ensure that fresh
recruitment is limited to 1 per cent of total civilian staff strength.
As about 3 per cent of staff retire every year, this will reduce the manpower
by 2 per cent per annum, achieving a reduction of10 per cent in five years
as announced by the Prime Minister.</li>

<li>
The Surplus Pool under the Department of Personnel will be streamlined
and equipped to redeploy and retrain surplus staff. Employees in the Surplus
Pool will also be offered an attractive VRS package.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Standard licence fee (rent) on government accommodation will be enhanced
by 50 per cent for Group A, 25 per cent for Group B and 15 per cent for
other categories of staff with effect from April 1, 2001.</li>

<li>
Facility of LTC to Central Government employees will be suspended for 2
years for the remaining part of the four-year block period except for employees
who are entitled to last LTC before retirement.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Use of Information Technology in government activities with large public
interface will be maximized to promote efficiency. For this purpose, operations
like GPF, pension, pay and accounts offices, passports, income tax, customs,
central excise, will be fully computerized by March 31, 2002. Public sector
banks and insurance companies are also being asked to complete computerization
of their operations within this period.</li>
</ul>
80. The Expenditure Reforms Commission, which was set up last year, has
presented reports concerning downsizing in 6 Ministries and Departments.
These include Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Information &amp;
Broadcasting, Ministry of Coal, Department of Heavy Industry, Department
of Public Enterprises and Ministry of Small Scale Industries. Reports of
the Commission concerning other Departments will also be received within
the next six months. These recommendations will be implemented by July
31, 2001 and identified surplus staff transferred to the Surplus Pool.&nbsp;
<p>81. Charity, it is said, must begin at home. I believe austerity, too,
must begin at home. To lead by example, based on the recommendations of
the Expenditure Reforms Commission, I propose to abolish three secretary/special
secretary level and two joint secretary level posts in the Department of
Economic Affairs. This will be done in stages by 31, July. In addition,
another 44 posts of directors and below will be abolished, as against 31
recommended by the ERC. 1675 posts are being abolished in the Currency
and Coinage Division which will be restructured and corporatised. The National
Savings Organisation is to be downsized from a level of 1191 staff to about
25. I have asked ERC to provide their recommendations in respect of the
Departments of Revenue and Expenditure also. I am confident that this will
expedite the process of right sizing the establishments in all the Ministries/Departments
of Government.&nbsp;
<p>82. The Planning Commission has commenced the task of preparing the
Tenth Plan. Given the severity of resource constraints, improvement in
the quality of government spending is of the essence. It has therefore
been decided to subject all existing schemes, both at the Central and State
levels, to zero based budgeting and to retain only those that are demonstrably
efficient and essential. Furthermore, all schemes that are similar in nature
will be converged to eliminate duplication. Centrally sponsored schemes
that can be transferred to States will be identified. Resource flows will
be linked to performance. Necessary procedural changes will also be made
to speed up the decision making process for approval of schemes. Utmost
importance will be given to decentralized planning.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Pension Reforms</font></u></b>
<p>83. The Central Government pension liability has reached unsustainable
proportions: as a percentage of GDP, it has risen from about 0.5 per cent
in 1993-94 to 1 per cent in 2000-2001. As such it is envisaged that those
who enter central government services after October 1, 2001 would receive
pension through a new pension programme based on defined contributions.
In order to review the existing pension system and to provide a roadmap
for the next steps to be taken by the Government, I propose to constitute
a High Level Expert Group, which would give its recommendations within
3 months.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Interest Rates</font></u></b>
<p>84. I have drawn your attention to the increasing share of debt service
burden in the expenditure budget caused by rising government debt and exacerbated
by the prevalence of high real interest rates. Most interest rates in the
economy are now market determined. But, their movement downward is constrained
by the rigidities inherent in the administered interest rates governing
the contractual saving sphere i.e. Provident Fund and Small Savings Schemes.
I have examined this issue very carefully. I find that the interest rates
provided in all these schemes seldom exceeded consumer price inflation
by more than 3 per cent between 1980 and 1998. Since then, this difference
has risen to 6 to 8 per cent. Not only are such high real interest rates
putting an unsustainable burden on both Central and State Governments but
the resulting high cost of capital is also inhibiting economic growth all
round. I am therefore reducing most administered rates by 1.5 per cent
as of March 1, 2001. Government guarantee and tax incentives for these
schemes will continue. For the future, I propose to explore a better system
for the determination of these rates. I propose to appoint an Expert Committee
to provide recommendations on this issue.&nbsp;
<p>85. The benefit of reduction in interest rates on Small Savings Deposits
will be fully passed on to the States. This will reduce their borrowing
cost from Small Savings by 100 to 150 basis points. In addition, I am also
reducing the interest rate on loans portion of Central assistance to State
Plans by 50 basis points. Alignment of interest rates on GPF by the State
Governments along with the reduced provident funds interest rates at the
Centre will further reduce the interest burden of State Governments. Moreover,
because of the anticipated increase in gross tax collection of the Centre,
devolution of central taxes to States is expected to increase by over Rs
9000 crore in 2001-02 over the current year. All these measures will help
in reducing the debt burden of the States and improve their fiscal position.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">State Fiscal Reforms</font></u></b>
<p>86. Along with fiscal consolidation at the Centre, it will be our endeavour
to work jointly with the States to reform their finances. Pursuant to the
recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission, an Incentive Fund of
Rs 10,607 crore has been earmarked for the next 5 years to encourage States
to implement monitorable fiscal reforms. These reforms will essentially
be the States’ own programmes and considerable flexibility has been provided
for individual States to design their programmes. In the fiscal year 2001-02,
I have provided an amount of Rs 4243 crore towards this Incentive Fund.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Public Sector Restructuring and Privatization</font></u></b>
<p>87. Our public sector has expanded in almost every area of economic
activity. In many ways, it has served the nation well; capability has been
developed all round and a strong industrial base built up. These enterprises
must now be strengthened to compete and prosper in the new environment.
Last year I had defined government’s policy in this regard clearly.&nbsp;
<p>88. Financial and business restructuring plans of a number of PSUs including
SAIL and HMT have been approved. Since 1998 financial restructuring support
to viable and potentially viable PSUs amounting to more than Rs 13,000
crore has been provided to 23 PSUs. Government has also decided to close
down 8 non-viable PSUs during the current year. A package of measures for
revival and closure of the various mills of National Textiles Corporation
has also been approved.&nbsp;
<p>89. The procedure for privatization of public sector enterprises has
now been considerably streamlined. The Department of Disinvestment has
been set up to accelerate the privatization process. To maximise returns
to government, our approach has shifted from the disinvestment of small
lots of shares to strategic sales of blocks of shares to strategic investors.
The Government has already approved privatization of 27 companies in which
the process of disinvestment is expected to be completed during the course
of the year. These companies include among others VSNL, Air India, and
Maruti Udyog Limited.&nbsp;
<p>90. Given the advanced stage of the process of disinvestment in many
of these companies, I am emboldened to take credit for a receipt of Rs
12000 crore from disinvestment during the next year. An amount of Rs 7000
crore out of this will be used for providing restructuring assistance to
PSUs, safety net to workers and reduction of debt burden. A sum of Rs 5000
crore will be used to provide additional budgetary support for the Plan
primarily in the social and infrastructure sectors. This additional allocation
for the plan will be contingent upon realization of the anticipated receipts.
In consultation with Planning Commission I shall come up with sectoral
allocation proposals during the course of the year.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Gujarat Earthquake</font></u></b>
<p>91. The earthquake in Gujarat has been a terrible and unprecedented
tragedy in terms of loss of life and damage to property. Although I am
confident that the inherent resilience and entrepreneurial spirit so characteristic
of the people of Gujarat will result in quick restoration of economic activity,
I would like to assure the House that we have the capacity to fully meet
the challenges of such natural calamities without deflecting from our path
of pursuing our economic goals.&nbsp;
<p>92. To enable the State Government to deal with the situation, Government
of India is extending the following assistance:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Rs 500 crore was made available to the State immediately from the National
Calamity Contingency Fund.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The National Calamity Contingency Fund, set up with initial corpus of Rs
500 crore as a result of the Eleventh Finance Commission recommendations,
is being augmented by the imposition of a 2 per cent surcharge on personal
income tax and corporate tax.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Assistance will be provided to the State Government under various Centrally
Sponsored Schemes for reconstruction of roads, bridges, power installations,
school buildings, public utilities and other public infrastructure.</li>

<li>
Arrangements have been tied up with the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank for obtaining a line of credit of US $ 800 million. A joint team has
already visited Gujarat and substantial additional funds are expected to
be negotiated.</li>

<li>
RBI has instructed banks to make special arrangements for freezing of recoveries
and extension of new loans on a liberal terms for borrowers in the affected
areas.</li>

<li>
The National Housing Bank and HUDCO have set apart adequate funds for housing
reconstruction. I also propose to allocate a special quota of tax free
bonds of the order of Rs 2000 crore between the two institutions.</li>

<li>
As was done after the Orissa cyclone, cement and steel used for construction
in the Indira Awas Yojana, by HUDCO and by agencies identified by the State
Government, would be exempt from excise duty.</li>

<li>
The Government of Gujarat will be enabled to raise funds by floating tax
free earthquake relief bonds which will be open to subscription in Rupees
to individuals and others including Non-Resident Indians through the Reserve
Bank of India.</li>

<li>
All goods intended for relief have been exempted from excise and customs
duties; direct tax assessees have been given extension of time for filing
their returns.</li>
</ul>
93. A natural calamity of this magnitude has also highlighted the need
to set up permanent institutional arrangements for management of national
disasters. The National Committee on Disaster Management under the Chairmanship
of Prime Minister will be making recommendations for laying down effective
long term strategy for this purpose.&nbsp;

<p>94. We have been able to adhere to the Budget target of fiscal deficit
despite pressures on public finances on account of deceleration in disinvestment
programme, natural calamities and the relief to consumers of petroleum
products. The revised estimates for the current fiscal year show a marginal
decrease in expenditure of Rs 2,965 crore as compared to the Budget estimates.&nbsp;
<p>95. Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated to be Rs 1,44,403
crore compared to the Budget estimates of Rs 1,46,209 crore, thereby reflecting
a shortfall of Rs 1806 crore. The shortfall is mainly due to lower collection
of Customs and Union Excise duties which were reduced to provide relief
to POL consumers. Non tax revenue is estimated at Rs 61,763 crore, Rs 4299
crore more than the estimated level of Rs 57,464 crore. However, disinvestment
receipts are expected to be lower at Rs 2500 crore against the Budget target
of Rs 10,000 crore.&nbsp;
<p>96. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of the GDP is expected to be
on target at 5.1 per cent.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Budget Estimates for 2001-2002</font></u></b>
<p>97. In the budget estimates for 2001-2002, the total expenditure is
estimated at Rs 3,75,223 crore, of which Rs 100,100 crore is for plan and&nbsp;
<br>Rs 275,123 crore for non-plan.&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Plan Expenditure</font></u></b>
<p>98. The budget support for Central, State and UT Plans has been placed
at Rs 100,100 crore, an increase of Rs 13,862 crore over revised estimates
2000-2001. This amounts to an increase of 16 per cent. Gross budgetary
support for the Central Plan is being enhanced from Rs 48,269 crore in
the revised estimates 2000-2001 to Rs 59,456 crore in 2001-2002. Central
Plan assistance to States and Union Territories in 2001-2002 is also proposed
to be increased to Rs 40,644 crore from Rs 37,969 crore in the revised
estimates 2000-2001&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font color="#990000">Non Plan Expenditure</font></u></b>
<p>99. Non-plan expenditure in 2001-2002 is estimated to be Rs 2,75,123
crore compared to Rs 2,49,284 crore in Revised estimates for 2000-2001.
The increase in non-plan expenditure is mainly in interest payments (Rs
11,633 crores), defence (Rs 7,539 crore) and Grants to State Governments
(Rs 2,221 crore).&nbsp;
<p>100. In order to practice greater accountability and transparency, I
am attaching with the budget papers this year a new report on "Implementation
of Budget Announcements, 1999-2000 and 2000-01".</td>
