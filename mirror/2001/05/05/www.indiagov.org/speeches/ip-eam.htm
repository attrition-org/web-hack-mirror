<p>The theme on which we are gathered here today to share thoughts has
four integrals; the expectation, understandably, being that it is the Indian
view point which will be put across. This is reasonable enough with two
caveats, however. Firstly, though there distinctly is an Indian approach
to the questions that the theme poses, it cannot be "that the answers that
are offered are so exclusively Indian that none other share those views,
because the broader aspects of the theme do have an universal relevance.
The second caveat is that though I owe the honour of this invitation to
the fact of the office that I hold, I do not share thoughts with you in
that capacity alone. I do so as a student of current history, too
<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font color="#993300">What are these four
aspects?</font></font></b>
<p>i) Perspective:- Of what is a perspective born?&nbsp;
<p>ii) Security:- What exactly is it that we seek as security? What are
the&nbsp;
<br>vital integrals of national security?&nbsp;
<p>iii) Issues: - Our outlining of a perspective and broadly defining quest
for security - (holistically, and in detail) itself identifies the issues
that confront us, and finally;&nbsp;
<p>iv) Regional and International:- This explains itself though we need
to be clear about who defines regions, and why and how?
<p>Let me attempt to now share thoughts on the questions that I have myself
raised.&nbsp;
<p>2. Perspective and issues:-
<p>I intend to cover these two together, principally because from perspectives
flow issues.
<p>It is both expected of and is of course the responsibility of foreign
ministries to constantly study global trends, to attempt not just to identifying
these trends, as against events alone, but to also attend to the duty of
influencing them into more benign directions.
<p>Where is our world, as we face this new millennia, headed? In what direction,
and impelled by what ideas or issues? We can only surmise, for though an
Indian, I am afraid, I am not endowed with that faculty which I am informed
is our characteristics an ability to look into the opaque uncertainty of
the future and be able to decipher its imponderables, We have but one foundation
on which we can structure an assessment of possibilities - History. Necessarily,
our future must have some connection - (which is not a synonym for continuity)
- with the past. From History, therefore, what connection do we endeavour
to discern for the future? Primarily, of those broad trends of ideas, which
in turn influence events. Thus an understanding of the trends of history
becomes our guide. But only a guide. Because a realistic and objective
assessment of the nature of the world as it is then becomes a necessary
balancing requirement, for the world, alas, is as it is: which is a very
far cry from our dream of the world as it ought to be.
<p>A distinction also needs to be made at this juncture between trends
and events. We routinely speak of the sheer unpredictability of events.
This is an accurate observation, verified by our experience of history.
Yet, I believe, this is more applicable - to single, individual events.
Trends are born of ideas and larger tendencies, which remain relatively
unchanged. They are a consequence of that broader sweep of the evolution
of human thought, hence history.
<center>
<p><b><u><font color="#993366">A Perspective for and the Issues of Our
Times</font></u></b></center>

<p>We stand on the doorway of the 21st Century. As we reflect on the Century
that has just passed, the 20th, the trends that were then either set in
motion, or demonstrated clearly stand out, Let us look back to 1900: What
is most striking as we do so is to find that but for the USA, or France,
almost the entire rest of the globe was under monarchies. Democracy and
representationalism' was but in its infancy. And yet, as the Century progressed,
this trend towards democracy got so irresistibly established that it became
the predominant movement of the 20th Century, Monarchies collapsed, as
did the great colonial Empires, which had had their origins in the discovery
of the sea routes to India, and incidentally only to America. I reflect
often upon this great chance discovery: Christopher Columbus setting sail
for fabled India and reaching America. What if he had not?&nbsp;
<p>The 20th Century saw not only the end of dynasties and monarchies and
empires, most transiting to democracy, but also the ascendancy, reign and
then the decline of the Doctrine of Marx. This example - of the rise and
fall of such a powerful idea - of Marxism - (Communism) within one life
span, has seldom been experienced earlier. Is there a lesson here: about
fallibility, and about the arrogance of doctrinaire certainty?&nbsp;
<p>The 20th, was also without doubt, possibly the most violent of all the
centuries that mankind has experienced since the dawn of time. And, as
we, therefore. attempt to distill trends from this broad sweep of history,
are we to infer that, at the dawn of this new Millennium, and our entry
in to the 21st Century, we have now entered an era that marks the and of
conflict? I cannot answer in the affirmative.&nbsp;
<p>Conflict, has not come to an end, it continues, for it never really
ceased. What has altered is the nature of war and peace, which has changed
both in the political and in the technological sense. And as part of technological
please reflect upon a reality: Instant TV is one of the modern day participants
in conflicts thus directly influencing its conduct, also often, the handling
and a resolution of it. It is also no longer possible to think in terms
of a single great conflict; and not simply because there is only one superpower,
It is no longer possible to conceive of a situation in which any country
is entirely overrun and all its populace made subject - the Gulf War actually
exemplifies this. In fact, conventional wars, or what are sometimes called
'limited wars or conflicts', or even 'regional conflicts', persist, as
I earlier said, simply because they never really ceased. Yet another aspect
of change is this obliteration of the distinguishing line between 'internal'
and 'International' conflicts. Axiomatically, therefore, in such situations,
the difference between war and peace, therefore, between a state of war
and a state of peace has also altered radically, This is, possibly, an
unintended and Unexpected consequence of the end of the Cold War. Politically,
amongst other aspects the Twentieth Century is marked by the collapse of
Empires, the end of colonialism, emergence of new sovereignties, the two
great conflicts, the employment of air and its technology for war, the
dawn of the atomic age, and of profound importance - the collapse of the
USSR, The consequences of this last are yet to be fully assessed The relative
stability of the world, during the Cold War, was based on certain foundations
of time-tested international conduct: sovereignty of nation states, the
borders of it being sacrosanct, because the consequence of acting to the
contrary resulted in the unsettling of an established balance. With the
great melt down. in the freeze of the Cold War and the disintegration of
the Soviet Union also arrived an end to this self-limitation. Thus Central
Africa, Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Iraq today happen and we accept them, as if
all this is in the natural order of things, But this does raise serious
questions - questions as pertinent as the relevance of nation states.
<p>The other great transformation, directly impacting on security and international
relations has been brought about by advancements in technology. This has,
unequally though, given nations the power of "selective destruction". This
is, of course, an advancement but it has also inherent in it the possibility
of arbitrary and unjust employment. Thus, technological advancement in
the field of armaments has recreated. (for through History, there always
has existed such disparity), a new category of haves and have-nots. This,
too, has seeds of potential discord because, as the have-nots strive to
obtain that which the haves have, denial of access will lead to resentment.
Let me also refer here itself to what I call the phenomenon of a 'democratization
of access to means of destruction'. Increasingly, we witness this now,
as yet another consequence of the end of the Cold War. That Cold War period
was the golden age for the global armaments industry, they worked overtime,
at full capacity, reaped huge profits and proliferated arms of such variety
as mankind had not ever earlier seen. Even as the Berlin Wall was being
pulled down, this vast arsenal and its great capacity became available,
almost without interruption. Here readily entered the private armies, the
narcotics dealers, the terrorists, the purveyors of death. It is this availability
of arms that, at least in part, gave a new impetus to what is now almost
a new ideology - the ideology of terrorism.&nbsp;
<p>An outstanding example of this is, of course, to be found in what is
currently happening in Afghanistan-Pakistan. Earlier, a great contest on
the soil of Afghanistan, between the then USSR and, by proxy, the USA,
resulted in the birth of the Talibans and in consequence a great deal else
that has followed: Arms, narcotics, terrorist training camps and the creation
of a new and additional destabilizing agency. Equally inevitably what this
has resulted in is a kind of a validation of the employment of terrorism
and terrorists, as extensions of state policy. Thus encouragement, abetment,
financing, arming, training of terrorists by agencies of state has got
conferred a kind of legitimacy. From this an advocacy of 'Jehad' as an
instrument of foreign policy, has followed as a matter of course. The ertire
world is now, therefore, an arena for the application of this destructive
doctrine.&nbsp;
<p>As we address ourselves to what is by now a clich&eacute; phrase, the
'post-Cold War world', we ought at least to identify some distinguishing
features of it. I have already referred briefly to the as yet un-assessed
consequences of the disintegration of the USSR. We are just a decade down
the tine from that great event, and no doubt this historic development
will influence our future That is one part of it. The other is the emergence
of the United States of America as the pre-eminent global power:, militarily,
technologically, economically, indeed even, in terms of popular culture.
And, there is then that other irresistible trend - the spread of English
language, globally, in its many forms and derivatives, but most importantly
as compu-talk. Therefore, it is clear that for so long as United States
of America is able to maintain its economic, technological and industrial
position. it will remain the pre-eminent global power.&nbsp;
<p>Such a situation has not been experienced earlier, not during the Roman
Empire, not even during the vast sweep of the British Empire, And, here-in
perhaps lies both a paradox and the challenge: the world today is far too
complex to remain permanently so uni-polarised. Such a global primacy by
itself throws up questions which will unfold in the decades ahead. The
challenge, therefore, lies in understanding the perils of pre-eminence;
in recognizing that the essence of power lies in accepting the limits of
it.
<p>We must, at this juncture, reflect on the future of the State. Here
three contradictory tendencies are experienced. In large parts of the world,
particularly in Asia, and Africa, there exists, in contra-distinction to
trends elsewhere, an assertion of the role and relevance of the State,
the inviolability of the sovereignty of such State, and marked caution,
if not suspicion of trends that advocate a dilution of the State. In other
parts, we are witness to a re-definition of these very sovereignties, a
dilution of the hard lines of it, a movement towards coming together, to
federating into larger units. There is then the third, as for example in
the Balkans, or in parts of Africa, or disquietingly in Central Asia, where
the functional efficiency, political authority, indeed even legitimacy,
of the political organism of State is not simply being questioned, the
State itself has begun to whither. This is not unrelated to what I termed
earlier as a 'democratisation of means of destruction', in other words,
a loss of monopoly of the power of coercive force, earlier the sole prerogative
of the State. As there no longer obtains a power balance in the globe,
and as this is accompanied by an absence of any distinguishing central
authority, and we continue to persist in keeping in abeyance a real reform
of UN and expansion of UNSC. I apprehend that this simultaneous trend towards
anomie and the withering away of State could well persist in the decades
ahead. Self-evidently, this poses many security issues of altogether different
and new dimensions. Such States then become, in themselves, the source
of radiating instability, discord and violence.&nbsp;
<p>A brief word here about globalisation. An assertion of it is an advocacy
of the theoretical need for a wider access by all the global national players
to the total economic cake cif the world. The proposition is, however,
limited to greater access, not to greater sharing. Besides, this does not
mean that such advocacy actually results in any quick and equal access
either, Globalisation is, obviously, only a process, and it makes no claims
to operating evenly in all fields of human endeavour. Certainly even economic
globalisation is a far cry from political globalisation. The world is not
a single unit, and the globe, of course, is not a village.&nbsp;
<center>
<p><b><u><font color="#993366">SECURITY&nbsp;</font></u></b></center>

<p>Nation States, when they seek security in today's world are, therefore,
not any longer doing so purely in a militaristic sense, or as part of a
quest for possessing overpowering mechanized forces.
<p>In considering the totality of national security, economic security
is the pivot: its vitality, growth and dynamism becomes the principal security
imperative Economic strength, however, is impossible without industrial
output, which in turn is unsustainable without energy, and in the absence
of technological parity. All these are crucial security issues. So is a
protection of territory and the inviolability of national boundaries against
aggression. This is self-evident. But how is this to be addressed. when
a great question that we face today is demographic; both in the growth
of population, in the global imbalance in its growth, as also in the irrepressible
impulse of human beings to seek a better standard of life for themselves;
for which, to move where they can - irrespective of national boundaries.&nbsp;
<p>National Security must, of course, take into account the continued relevance
that weapons of mass destruction have, in the lexicon of real-politick,
as a currency of power. It is both ironic, and paradoxical that such weapons
are not, and must never be war fighting instruments. They subserve a very
different purpose, that of deterrence, which is the only sense in which
their relevance ties. Yet, here too, lies another great paradox. You can
only deter the rational and the responsible. We have yet to find an answer
for the factor of irrational response. That is why for Weapons of Mass
Destruction there is only one solution-universal, non-discriminatory and
total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the face of the
earth. India remains committed to this goal and we will continue to pursue
it untiringly. Like others, India, too, cannot do so unilaterally, in a
world of differentiated norms, of uneven and selective criteria of assessment
of national security.&nbsp;
<p>Increasingly, it is my conviction, five other issues will gain security
salience in the years ahead. They are: global consequences of environmental
profligacies of the past persuading the 'strong and the able' to act in
self interest, inviting protest from those that are left out. A quest for
higher energy security, at lower cost and on a more assured basis will
result in movements towards monopolization. Yet, again, an area of tension.
Thirdly, water, assured, potable water and its shortage, resulting in water-stressed
zones could cause the stress lines to radiate towards self-preservation,
hence conflict. So, too, with food security. The world is neither evenly
supplied nor evenly fed. Food adequacy is not universally applied, in consequence
plenty and scarcity exist simultaneously. To expect thereafter that they
will co-exist in perpetuity is to deny the reality of rising human expectations,
of first raising unrealistic hopes about an equitable global economic regime
and then not realizing them, whereafter - most tellingly, the consequences
of a spread of TV advertising, which informs the large global community
of have-nots, vividly, and daily, of what they do not&nbsp;
<br>actually have. Finally, will this quest for a militarization of outer
space introduce elements into national security calculii that are at present
absent?&nbsp;
<center>
<p><b><u><font color="#993366">REGION</font></u></b></center>

<p>I am required, finally, to share thoughts about the 'region' that India
inhabits. In the context of India's security our region gets defined, simply,
by the very geography of it. India's long land boundaries, unsettled and
yet to be defined, challenge the state of the craft of the country. Yet,
some other geographical facts borns from the&nbsp; and define our concerns
more accurately. India is but just about 90 odd nautical miles from the
northern-most Province of Indonesia-Aceh. Developments, therefore, in the
entire South-East Asian region are a matter of direct consequence to us.
In another direction, from the northern most point of India, which is now
part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Tajikistan a mere 35 kms away; thus
the Central Asian lands define that part of our region. The great vortex
of medieval malevolism and terrorism that has come into existence in Pakistan
and Afghanistan identify yet another aspect of the security of our region.
Just 50 years back, in 1947, we shared a land boundary with Iran. This
and our relations with the Gulf countries define the western aspect of
it. In the South stretches the Indian Ocean, which is not simply a spread
of salt water. It imparts a larger Political definition to India's regional
security imperatives. Besides, it is an old and established axiom that
the strategic boundaries of a nation's security concerns can simply not
coincide with its geographical limits alone. Of course, they are not coterminus
with simplistic regional classifications either, but More that as our digitalized
globe shrinks so, too national security concerns expand.
<center>
<p><b><u><font color="#993366">CONCLUSION</font></u></b></center>

<p>I have taxed your patience and goodwill. In conclusion, permit me to
address the aspects of new agenda items of international conduct that have
emerged. For the first time in human history, issues like environment and
human rights are on the screens of national security formulators.
<p>Environment, ecology, human rights, etc. have certainly for the past
two decades, at least, destabilized the nation that foreign policy is mostly
political. Yet, these issues along with others, coalescing into the realm
of foreign economic policy have acquired a cutting edge, which was not
so evident till the Berlin Wall finally collapsed. The doctrine of humanitarian
intervention in civil wars, has effectively superseded the older doctrine
of untrammeled national sovereignty. To this web of human rights and social
standards, environment, etc. other new factors are on the anvil. Most prominently,
the imminent creation of an international criminal court.
<p>These then constitute the issues of our tomorrow's even as we endeavour
to attend to our collective inheritance of today's perceptions and challenges.</td>
