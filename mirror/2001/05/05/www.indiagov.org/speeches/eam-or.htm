<p>1. It is a privilege for me to welcome the members of the National Committee
on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.
<p>2. Our task is to prepare for the World Conference being held in Durban,
South Africa in August/September this year. I am confident that your collective
wisdom and expertise will be invaluable in contributing to the work of
the National Committee.&nbsp;
<p>3. India has always been in the forefront of the international effort
to combat racism and racial discrimination. Gandhiji launched his Satyagraha
in South Africa. Later, in 1946, India was the first country to raise the
issue of apartheid at the UN. Nelson Mandela, who received the Jawaharlal
Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1979 and the Bharat Ratna
in 1990 was inspired by Gandhiji.&nbsp;
<p>4. Apartheid was not only repugnant to the ideals of any human society
but scientifically false, socially unjust, morally condemnable and legally
untenable. We have unequivocally and steadfastly condemned racial discrimination.
We believe it to be the antithesis of everything humanity stands for -
equality, justice, peace and progress. It is contrary to the Charter of
the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&nbsp;
<p>5. India's contribution to anti-colonial liberation movements around
the world is well known. Our support for the African National Congress
and the South West African Peoples Organization never flagged during their
fight against the racist regimes. The AFRICA Fund set up by us in 1986
was popularly identified with its acronym - Action For combating Racism,
Imperialism, Colonialism and Apartheid.
<p>6. Racial discrimination was, often, an adjunct of empire. Colonial
policies resulted in racial discrimination. Nazism was an evil doctrine
of racial supremacy that led to aggression, unparalleled inhumanity and
genocide.
<p>7. The end of the War and, more recently, the Cold War, sadly, did not
bring the peace and security that the world hoped it would. It is a matter
of deep regret that national and ethnic violence continues to remain a
challenge as do prejudice and violence against immigrants and refugees.
Advances in technology have brought to our very homes the pernicious phenomenon
of 'ethnic cleansing". In some countries organized racism is on the rise.
The sad reality is that racism remains the source of discrimination affecting
human interaction at the work place, schools, the neighborhood, even political
organizations and public administration. We must ensure that globalization
does not lead to exclusion and inequality along racial and ethnic lines.&nbsp;
<p>8. The International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racism
of 1965 embodies the collective will of the international community. India
has ratified this Convention in 1968 and has submitted 14 periodic reports.&nbsp;
<p>9. As you know, the United Nations decided in December 1997 to convene
this World Conference. It is expected to formulate concrete recommendations
to bolster action-oriented national, regional and international measures
to combat all forms of racism. It will be guided by inputs received from
Regional Conferences, Regional Thematic Seminars and will include suggestions
from States. A review of the political, historical, economic, social, cultural
and other factors leading to racism is an essential part of the exercise,
which is aimed at focusing on practical measures to eradicate racism. These
include measures of prevention, education and protection and provision
of effective remedies.&nbsp;
<p>10. There has, regrettably, been a deliberate attempt by some to dilute
the focus of this World Conference by broadening its scope to bring all
forms of discrimination within the ambit of the Conference. In this process,
attempt is also being made to ascribe racial connotations to caste. We
are strongly opposed to all such attempts. We must ensure that the Conference
does not lose sight of its focus on racism. We are opposed to discrimination
in any form. But racism should not be confused with discrimination in general.
Nor is it within the purview of the World Conference.
<p>11. It would be useful to identify ways to promote awareness, facilitate
implementation and foster international co-operation in fighting racial
discrimination. For this purpose, it may be worthwhile to consider holding
a National Seminar on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance sometime before the World Conference to have the benefit of
a broader spectrum of approaches and concerns within the country, and to
enable us to address them satisfactorily.&nbsp;
<p>12. The members of the Committee would have had the opportunity to examine
the themes and issues that will come up at the World Conference and the
documents that have been circulated. We will be circulating to you the
Draft Declaration and Programme of Action when it becomes available.&nbsp;
<p>13. As one of the oldest civilizations of the world, India has the responsibility
of making a substantial contribution to the world in its fight against
racism. The Conference must not restrict itself to pious words and lofty
ideals; it must be able to initiate actions that have a lasting impact.
Only then can this opportunity presented by the World Conference be properly
utilized to translate into reality our shared vision and convictions of
an egalitarian global family.&nbsp;
<p>14. I would request you as members of the National Committee to share
your perspectives on how best these should be tackled. Since there are
many members and time is limited, I would request you to be brief.
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;
