<td><b><font color="#804040">Your Excellency Engineer Seyyed Ainaghi Khamoushi,</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#804040">Distinguished members of Iranian and Indian
Industry,&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#804040">Ladies and Gentlemen,</font></b>
<p><font color="#804040">&nbsp;I value this opportunity today for an interaction
with leaders of Iranian and Indian industry.&nbsp; The presence of a distinguished
business delegation which has come from India and the participation of
many senior Iranian businessmen augurs well.&nbsp; It indicates the complimentarity
which exists between the two economies.&nbsp; It also suggests a mutual
recognition of the potential and new opportunities to strengthen economic
and commercial links.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Indo-Iranian commercial relations are embedded
in history.&nbsp; Indian spices, precious stones were valued in Iran for
centuries.&nbsp; Similarly, Persian rose water and dry fruits were greatly
sought after in India. In fact, I understand that Seiraf, Hormoz and some
other Persian ports were initially developed to meet the requirements of
Indo-Iranian trade. We need to rebuild on these historical links in today’s
new context.&nbsp; There is ample scope to do so.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Both Iran and India are moving ahead to improve
the quality of life of their people and seek their rightful place in the
global economy.&nbsp; India for nearly a decade continues to be among the
fastest growing economies&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; world&nbsp; with&nbsp;
a GDP growth between 6 – 6.5%.&nbsp; This coupled with modest inflation,
a comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves and policies aimed at
fiscal correction, indicates strong and stable macro-fundamentals.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Coupled with this, the progressive de-regulation
of our economy has created new opportunities for private investment.&nbsp;
This is particularly so in the area of infrastructure – Telecom, Roads,
Ports, Power and the Energy sector. Our moderate rates of taxes, progressive
reforms of financial and capital market makes the large Indian market an
attractive destination for foreign investment.&nbsp; In the recent Budget
presented to Parliament at the end of February, the road map for the Second
Generation Reforms has been articulated at length. They cover action ranging
from fiscal policies, down-sizing of Government, Labour reforms, Tax Policy
changes and improved management of our food economy.&nbsp; We intend to
pursue these reforms with earnest and build a consensus across the political
parties and with State Governments for an orderly implementation of these
wide ranging measures.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">I am conscious that the Islamic Republic of Iran,
as part of its Third Economic Development Plan is also striving to transform
its economy into a modern, international and competitive enterprise.&nbsp;
Iran’s new focus on development of the country’s non-oil economy and reduced
dependence on the oil-based economy offers new areas of co-operation with
India.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Looked at an overall point of view, we should
concentrate on five key areas.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">First, the obvious – namely, co-operation in the
field of Energy or rather Energy security.&nbsp; Iran’s large energy reserves
of oil and gas and the large Indian market to meet its energy needs is
the most obvious area of complimentarity.&nbsp; We import large quantities
of petroleum crude from Iran both by the public and private sector.&nbsp;
This demand would grow.&nbsp; In addition to this, the Indo-Iran Joint
Commission is studying all aspects relating to the Gas Pipeline from Iran
to India.&nbsp; We must pursue these on-going deliberations with speed
and vigour.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">On the pipeline issue, we must ensure that the
project is cost-effective and secure even while keeping all our options
open.&nbsp; The feasibility study for the off-shore route should be completed
expeditiously.&nbsp; The on-going projects on LNG should be monitored carefully
and completed in the stipulated time.&nbsp; This will enable co-operation
in the field of energy to bear early fruit.&nbsp; It will create a conducive
environment and augur well for the more ambitious projects we have in mind.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">The future of Asia would be greatly influenced
by the manner in which countries in the region jointly harness their energy
reserves to each others mutual advantage.&nbsp; The Indo-Iranian co-operation
in the field of energy can set a shining example in this area.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">&nbsp;Second, co-operation and joint ventures
in energy related activities need active encouragement.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">We could think of&nbsp; projects like :-</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#804040">Setting up coastal-based Power Stations&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Value-added industries based on down-stream hydrocarbons
like;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Petro-chemicals&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Refineries&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Fertilizers&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Ancilliary industry based on the utilization of oil
and gas need to be actively pursued.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#804040">Third, we must give a boost to bilateral trade.&nbsp;
Total bilateral trade in 1999-2000 was a billion dollar with the balance
of trade being in Iran’s favour for the obvious reason of high value petroleum
related imports. Apart from increasing exchanges in petroleum related products,
we must look at other areas. India’s non-oil imports are also not insignificant,
comprising of sulphur, organic and inorganic chemicals and dry fruits.&nbsp;
India’s exports of both traditional and non-traditional products is way
below its potential.&nbsp; The Joint Business Council have identified key
areas of action. While bilateral trade in the last one year has risen noticeably,
I suggest that the Joint Business Council should set for itself an ambitious
target and a credible strategy.&nbsp; Can we double the trade in one year
and triple it in three years time?&nbsp; This is an ambitious but an achievable
goal. India has achieved considerable sophistication in the production
of wide range of goods and services ranging from traditional items to consumer
products and hi-technology based products.&nbsp; Both Iran and India are
developing countries and have shared many common goals and approaches.
We must pro-actively look at what we can supply to each other and can substitute
our dependence of imports from the more developed markets.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">&nbsp;&nbsp; For improving mutual access, I also
suggest we examine the possibility of a Preferential Trade Agreement between
India and Iran.&nbsp; If for enabling such an arrangement to effectively
work, a supporting financial and credit facility becomes necessary, we
should be willing to consider and support such mechanisms.&nbsp; Inadequacy
of banking arrangements constitutes a handicap in the furtherance of our
economic relations.&nbsp; I am given to understand that the Tejarat Bank
of Iran has applied to the Reserve Bank of India for opening a branch office
in India.&nbsp; Governor, Reserve Bank of India, informs me that this request
will be considered and necessary permission would be accorded soon.&nbsp;
We hope that this would be a reciprocal arrangement and would also enable
an Indian bank to set up a branch office in Teheran. Such reciprocal banking
arrangements would strengthen economic and trade arrangements.&nbsp; In
the same spirit, we are also agreeable to offer a Line of Credit of 200
million dollars to Iran for supporting India’s participation in Iran’s
Third Economic Development Plan, particularly supporting infrastructure
projects.&nbsp; The terms and conditions of this credit facility can be
worked out to the mutual satisfaction of both Governments.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">These arrangements would send a powerful signal
of our earnest desire to improve commercial links between the two countries.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Fourth, we must encourage co-operation in the
area of New Economy and in the field of science and technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This should cover areas like :-</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#804040">&nbsp;Information Technology</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Telecommunication</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Electronics</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Pharmaceuticals &amp; Bio-Technology</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Co-operative endeavours to utilize India’s large
reservoir of Engineers, Scientists, Technicians and skilled personnel.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Development of Remote Sensing</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Communication Satellite and Launch Vehicles</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#804040">Oceanography</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#804040">As is well known, India’s information technology
industry has received global recognition. Our software professionals and
entrepreneurs both in India and in Silicon Valley, have established a global
dominance in short period.&nbsp; I believe, that both India and Iran can
benefit significantly from the strengths which we have established in this
sphere.&nbsp; We are willing to provide our experience in software development,
training of human resources and infrastructure development to our friends
in Iran.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Finally, encouraging Joint Ventures and Direct
Foreign Investment.&nbsp; Some of the on-going projects reviewed at the
last meeting of the Joint Commission needs an added momentum.&nbsp; This
includes areas like expansion of fertiliser projects, provision of technical
services through Indian Consultancy Organisations, investment in Free Trade
Zones and enhancing co-operation in Railways and Shipping arrangements.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Iran has a strategic location to provide access
to Central Asia and adjoining regions.&nbsp; In this context, the international
North-South Transport Corridor agreement between India, Iran and Russia
and the Tripartite Agreement between India, Iran and Turkmenistan offer
unique opportunities for expansion of Indo-Iranian economic and commercial
ties.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Both India and Iran are poised to play an important
role in the development of Asia.&nbsp; I hope that the deliberations today
would create greater awareness of the new opportunities which exists between
the two countries. I also hope that the contact between the business communities
of both the countries would enable them to grasp these new opportunities
for enabling Indo-Iranian co-operation to realise its full potential.</font>
<p><font color="#804040">Thank you</font></td>
