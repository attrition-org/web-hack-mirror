<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Madam President,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Permit me to congratulate you on South Africa's
Chairmanship of the Movement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All of us have spelt out in some detail our national
concerns in our statements in the General Debate. Here, therefore, I will
only focus on one or two issues which are of particular concern to us as
the Non-Aligned Movement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The first question that we must address is the
role of the Movement itself. I am not raising the superfluous: Do we need
NAM? That is a settled question. In our view, more now than ever, we do
need NAM to face the common challenges that continue to be faced by developing
countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The question that I want to put is slightly different.
Are we doing enough to set the agenda for international relations, or are
we simply passive subjects? We represent the overwhelming majority of the
United Nations, and it is our problems, whether political, economic or
social, that form the bulk of the UN agenda. Unfortunately, however, it
is not our views that really count or even find adequate reflection in
the decisions. Others prescribe to us what we should do. We react, and
very often do not even do that. We simply accept what gets prescribed for
us. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Perhaps, because we have been passive, these prescriptions
have become increasingly intrusive. An array of new norms is being set
up, calling into question our perspectives, priorities, even national sovereignty.
I would urge the Movement to examine very carefully the implications of
all of these developments, and to forge a common position on them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Because these external challenges are often beyond
our capacity, as individual member states, to tackle on our own, it is
particularly necessary that we maintain and reinforce our unity. We simply
cannot permit ourselves to be distracted or divided by issues that are
contentious within the Movement. We already have far too much to do together
in trying to overcome our common difficulties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">That is why we oppose, on principle, attempts
at establishing a conflict resolution mechanism for NAM. That is not a
NAM priority. As the Secretary General has repeatedly reminded us, the
vast majority of ongoing conflicts are not between the UN's member states.
Instead, these are conflicts of an entirely different nature - driven by
economic and social problems, or by international terrorism, or by complex
emergencies. When the UN is moving away from a focus on conflicts between
member states to these other complexities, and devising, as I have just
said, methods of addressing them with consequences for all of us, it is
doubly self-defeating for NAM to ignore these developments, invest its
time and divide itself in a needless wrangle on an issue which is not needed,
and which is so deeply controversial. I urge my colleagues to consider
this carefully. The principle on which we should operate is to nourish
what unites us, to eschew what separates us. As a group, we have enough
pressing and momentous challenges before us, to concern ourselves with
the inevitably unproductive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Precisely because we need to be united, and because
we should be able to subscribe completely to the decisions of the Movement,
it is also absolutely essential that NAM's decisions should be taken, as
they always have been by consensus. If attempts are made to push through
decisions in any other way, the Movement will be weakened, because, instead
of our focusing our attentions to the tasks that confront all of us, we
would then be distracted by narrow and limited agendas. Even more importantly,
if any of the Movement's decisions raises doubts in any Member's mind about
its legitimacy, commitment to the Movement gets affected. Under South Africa's
chairmanship, we are sure this will not happen. Nevertheless, this is a
danger that we need to guard against, and I would urge, Madam President,
that the traditions of the Movement, developed over the years, and maintained
with good cause, be nurtured and protected. We need a strong, united Non-Aligned
Movement, and we are sure that under your leadership this is what we will
get.</FONT></P>
