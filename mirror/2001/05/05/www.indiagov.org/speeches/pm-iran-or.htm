<td><font color="#003300">Your Excellency President Khatami,</font>
<p><font color="#003300">Distinguished Members of the Iranian delegation,</font>
<p><font color="#003300">I would like to once again express my deep gratitude
for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation.</font>
<p><font color="#003300">2. My visit is a link in the process of political
dialogue between our two countries.&nbsp; Our interaction today is also
in keeping with our traditional ties of friendship and the process of exchange
of ideas and opinions which has taken place between our peoples all through
history. Our dialogue reflects a mutual desire to give greater content
to our relations by enhancing ongoing cooperation and by identifying new
areas of cooperation.&nbsp; I am confident that our deliberations today
and my meetings with your colleagues during the visit will make a significant
contribution to this process.</font>
<p><font color="#003300">3. Excellency,&nbsp; our Joint Commission has
been a useful vehicle for strengthening and diversifying our economic cooperation
for the welfare of our peoples.&nbsp; We should focus on speedy implementation
of decisions for&nbsp; a greater momentum in our bilateral cooperation.
Our Defence Secretary has recently visited Iran and we have identified
a wider scope for our cooperation in this field as well.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#003300">4. We should actively encourage greater people-to-people
contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy we have decided to hold an India
Week in Iran and a corresponding Iran Week in India.&nbsp; They can help
to enrich the content of our bilateral interaction.&nbsp; Our bilateral
links could be further reinforced through regular exchanges between Parliamentarians
of our two countries.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#003300">5. India considers Iran an important source of
its energy requirements.&nbsp; We have an enormous and accelerating demand
for energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to look to Iran not only for crude
oil, of which we are already buying substantial quantities, but also for
natural gas. The Joint Committee on the transfer of natural gas to India
is pursuing its mandate seriously and in a time-bound manner.&nbsp; Mutually
satisfactory, long-term, cost-effective and secure mechanisms for the transfer
of gas have to be put in place.&nbsp; The Committee needs to comprehensively
explore all viable alternatives for this purpose.</font>
<p><font color="#003300">6. Our trade and economic cooperation should not
remain confined to oil and natural gas.&nbsp; A push has to be given in
other sectors too.&nbsp; For this purpose we have to encourage the private
sectors of both countries. I am sure that the captains of India’s trade
and industry, who are in Iran these days, will establish purposeful and
productive links with their Iranian counterparts.&nbsp; The level and diversity
of the business delegation illustrates the appreciation in Indian business
circles of cooperation opportunities in Iran.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#003300">7. Excellency, India has made great progress
in many fields of high technology.&nbsp; Our achievements in Information
Technology are recognised the world over.&nbsp; We would be happy to cooperate
in this field for mutual benefit. Developing countries like India and Iran
need to maximize their cooperation for harnessing technology for socio-economic
development so that the digital divide does not create new inequalities.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#003300">8. Iran is a natural and important land bridge
to Central Asia.&nbsp; The India-Iran-Turkmenistan Transport and Transit
Trade Agreement and the North-South Transport Corridor Agreement are important
developments for regional economic integration.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#003300">9. I will briefly touch upon the situation in
Afghanistan and the negative signals emanating from there.&nbsp; The terrorism,
illegal narcotics trade and extremist ideologies flowing out of the Taliban
controlled areas of Afghanistan have an adverse impact on the peace and
security of our region.&nbsp; The destruction of historical artifacts by
the Taliban displays an inherently violent mentality.&nbsp; Both India
and Iran have to confront these developments, which directly impinge on
our national interests and security concerns.&nbsp; I believe that our
regular consultations on the situation in Afghanistan and our continuing
cooperation in addressing the problem is vital for ensuring regional security.</font>
<p><font color="#003300">10. Excellency, a regular high-level dialogue
between our two countries sustains the momentum in our bilateral relationship.&nbsp;
I have great pleasure in inviting Your Excellency on a State visit to India.&nbsp;
Your visit would enable us to carry forward the cooperative endeavours
which we shall be discussing during my visit here.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#003300">Thank you.</font>
