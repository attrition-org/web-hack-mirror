<p><b><u>Statement by Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission</u></b>
<br><b><u>and Leader of the Indian delegation</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Mr. President,
<p>1. May I begin by congratulating you on behalf of my delegation and
on my own behalf on your election to the Presidency of this General Conference.
I am confident that under your able guidance this General Conference will
successfully accomplish the tasks assigned to it. I would also like to
take this opportunity to welcome the entry of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and
the Central African Republic to the membership of the International&nbsp;
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>2. I have great pleasure in reading out a message from the Prime Minister
of India, Mr. Atal&nbsp; Bihari Vajpayee:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>“We have emerged from the Millenium Summit of the United Nations with
a redoubled resolve to work for balanced and sustainable socio-economic
development for our people. The energy of the atom can be harnessed to
further this agenda. Nuclear power provides an important and clean energy
option for mitigating the energy shortfalls in the developing world. Last
year, we in India commissioned two modern nuclear power reactors, built
with indigenous technology and expertise. We have also succeeded in increasing
the average capacity factor in our nuclear power plants to a figure of
80 %. Scientific research has uncovered beneficial applications of radioisotopes
and radiation in agriculture, medicine and industry.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Together with ensuring safety and monitoring safeguards, we believe
that the IAEA has an important role in promoting technological capabilities
among its member states for these developmental goals. As a founder member
of the Agency, India would extend its fullest support to these endeavours.
<br>&nbsp;I take this opportunity to wish the 44th General Conference of
the IAEA all success in its deliberations.”&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>3. This year the Director General submitted to the Board the Agency’s
Medium Term Strategy (MTS), envisaged to form the basis for the formulation
of programme proposals in the years 2001-2005. In this regard, I would
like to emphasize that the IAEA was created with the main objective of
accelerating and enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace,
health and prosperity throughout the world.&nbsp; This is the central pillar
on which the Agency should rest while giving due consideration to safeguards
measures to prevent the use of Agency assistance for military proposes,
and establish safety standards for protection of health and minimisation
of danger to life and property.&nbsp; Safety and safeguards are indeed
important and necessary supporting activities to enlarging and accelerating
the contribution of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.&nbsp; However,
they cannot become activities of the IAEA overshadowing the peaceful uses
of atomic energy. Primacy must be accorded to technology.&nbsp; This is
the only way we can faithfully interpret the time-tested Statute of the
Agency.
<p>4. Our delegation supports the priority assigned to the potential role
of nuclear energy in sustainable development in the Medium Term Strategy
which is in line with the recommendations of the Scientific Forum held
during the last General Conference. In this regard, we would like to reiterate
that IAEA with its comprehensive in-house expertise, as well as its access
to globally available expertise, would do well to pool all resources to
facilitate the role of nuclear energy in sustainable development. This
is the need of the hour and the Agency programme should include the Role
of innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles for Sustainable Development.&nbsp;
We appreciate the Director General’s efforts in trying to establish&nbsp;
a&nbsp; Task Force for this purpose.&nbsp; We feel strongly that it will
be worthwhile for the Agency to support this programme as part of the regular
programme of the Agency.
<p>5. In the context of sustainability of nuclear power, it is appropriate
for the Agency to address the issue of various nuclear fuel cycle options.&nbsp;
A discussion by experts on the merits and problems of the closed-fuel cycle
versus the open-fuel cycle with its associated technical, financial and
environmental aspects could form a meaningful part of the Medium Term Strategy.&nbsp;
Recognising the importance of the role of nuclear energy especially in
developing countries, India, along with Group 77 and China, has been requesting
a&nbsp; ‘Nuclear Technology Review’ on the lines of the nuclear safety
review and to discuss it as part of the dedicated agenda in the Board and
in the&nbsp; General Conference.&nbsp; We are happy that the Director General
has heeded to our request and has also appointed Standing Advisory Groups
for Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Science and Applications.
<p>6. Mr President: Even in countries which are currently seeing a slowdown
in their nuclear power development programme it is likely that a reversal
would occur due to two factors - firstly, due to a substantial increase
in oil prices as is happening now and, secondly, due to their commitment
to the Kyoto Protocol. For a large country like India, with its need to
increase its per capita electricity consumption substantially, rapid growth
in nuclear electricity generation capacity is of vital importance.&nbsp;
<p>7. In India, our strong policy emphasis on nuclear power is on the operation
of nuclear power plants in a safe and reliable manner. It is a matter of
satisfaction that the second unit of Rajasthan Atomic Power Station, where
coolant channel replacement and upgradation works were successfully completed
in 1998 based on indigenous technology and tools has been operating exceedingly
well since then. During the last GC we had announced the commissioning
of an indigenously designed and built 220 MW(e) Pressurised Heavy Water
Reactor (PHWR) at Kaiga. Since then another PHWR has gone commercial at
Rajasthan. Two more units of 220 MW (e) are expected to reach criticality
soon. Construction work on the two indigenously designed 500 MW(e) PHWR
units at Tarapur is in full swing. The preparation of the Detailed Project
Report (DPR) for the construction of two 1000 MW (e) VVERs at Kudankulam
in technical cooperation with Russia began in April 1999 and is expected
to be completed next year. Site related activities have already commenced.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>8. Necessitated by our limited uranium resources and in order to ensure
long term energy security India has opted for a closed nuclear fuel cycle
policy, involving a fast breeder reactor programme and thorium utilization
and associated fuel reprocessing and refabrication plants. The capabilities
for providing the technology resources for our programme have been mainly
derived from our strong R &amp; D programme. In the 15-year old Fast Breeder
Test Reactor (FBTR) at Kalpakkam, the performance of the unique and indigenously
developed mixed Uranium-Plutonium Carbide fuel has been extremely good
and so far it has reached a maximum burn-up of 53,830 MWd/t without any
fuel failure. Preparations for the commencement of construction of a 500
Mwe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) are underway. The U233 fuelled
Kamini research reactor is also being operated successfully. A closed fuel
cycle is also important for the safe management of the environment as it
brings down the quantity of high level wastes to very low levels.&nbsp;
<p>9. At the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), there is a strong emphasis
on activities related to the&nbsp; design and development of the Advanced
Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR), using plutonium and U233. The reactor will
have several advanced safety features, such as passive safety systems not
requiring either external power or operator action for activation. Experimental
programmes to validate the computer codes used for the design of the natural
circulation based coolant system of the AHWR are now well underway.&nbsp;
India’s efforts in developing the AHWR, which will facilitate thorium utilization,
is an effort toward developing innovative reactor and fuel cycle designs
for sustainable development of nuclear energy. The growth in installed
power generation capacity will, of course, continue with plants of state-of-the-art
designs of thermal and fast reactors with emphasis on improved safety.
In this context, we appreciate the initiative of President Putin announced
in the recent UN Millenium Summit where he has recognised that the most
rapid energy production growth will take place in the next century in the
developing countries. He has also said that to diminish ecological degradation
caused by greenhouse gases and to save global fossil reserves for non-electricity
uses by the present and future generations there is the need to develop
new nuclear technologies which are also proliferation resistant. As already
mentioned by me earlier, IAEA with its comprehensive membership covering
almost the entire world and, more importantly, the developing Member States,
has the collective responsibility to find technological solutions to such
problems. India on its part, as always, strongly supports these efforts
and will actively participate in such initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>10. We are also pursuing R&amp;D in non-grid based electricity applications
of nuclear energy such as desalination, process heat generation, production
of non-fossil fuels and compact portable power packs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since
1995, MOX fuel designed at BARC has been introduced in a limited fashion
in the Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) at Tarapur. The fuel has performed
well and the discharged assemblies will now undergo post-irradiation examination.
This programme is a forerunner to the introduction of MOX in a bigger way
for the utilization of Pu in thermal reactors in addition to the programme
of using Pu in fast reactors. This experience in plutonium recycle is also
of importance in the context of our long term interest in thorium which,
incidentally, is also an excellent host for deep burning of fissile materials
as compared to other alternatives and offers excellent charateristics needed
for addressing issues related to large-scale deployment of nuclear&nbsp;
power globally.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>11. The power programme has been matched by good performance from its
support base. The Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) has exceeded its target for
the&nbsp; production of fuel and structural components for 1999-2000, while
reducing the energy consumption per kilogramme of fuel fabrication. A few
weeks back it reached a major milestone by manufacturing the 2,00,000th
bundle of PHWR fuel.&nbsp; The Heavy Water Board, by streamlining its manufacturing
processes, ensured lower production costs while enhancing quality and productivity
at the same time. The&nbsp; Electronics Corporation of India (ECIL) successfully
tested and supplied microprocessor based safety related systems for nuclear
power plants at Kaiga and Rajasthan and installed successfully a man-machine
interface (MMI) application package in the control instrumentation at Narora
and Kakrapar.
<p>12. From the point of view of safety also the last year has been excellent.
A peer review was successfully performed early this year by the World Association
of Nuclear Operators (WANO) at the nuclear power plant at Narora, one of
our older indigenously designed plants. The Y2K roll-over occurred smoothly
in India.&nbsp; As one of the 11 critical sectors identified by the Government,
India had taken, in advance, all precautionary measures in the atomic energy
sector. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) monitored all the activities
in this regard. Progress has also been made in initiating safety related
research projects at the Safety Research Institute of AERB.&nbsp;
<p>13. Our R&amp;D programme has continued to lay emphasis in areas such
as medicine, agriculture and industry. Tracer technology has been used
successfully to detect leaks in petrochemical industries. A commercial
facility for irradiation of spices upto 12,000 tonnes/year was commissioned
early this year near Mumbai. A POTON irradiator, a demonstration plant
for irradiation of 10 tonnes/hour of potatoes and onions is nearing completion.
The Board for Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT) has developed and
exported gamma chambers against orders received from the IAEA. It recently
exported 50,000 curies of Cobalt-60 source along with irradiation flask
and conveyor system to Bangladesh. Based on its R&amp;D, the implantation
of biocompatible metallic stents, coated with 32P, to help patients who
have undergone angioplasty has been undertaken successfully. Some work
in these areas has also been taken up under the aegis of the Regional Cooperation
Agreement (RCA) programme for Asia and the Pacific. As a founder member
of the RCA, India is a strong supporter of the programme and has hosted
several events including the meeting of the RCA national coordinators meeting
early this year.&nbsp;
<p>14. India continues to invest in fundamental research. For example,
at the Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), work on the indigenous fabrication
of the superconducting steady state tokamak SST 1 is in full swing and
the commissioning of the tokamak is expected by end 2002.&nbsp; We would
be happy to participate, on the basis of our experience, in international
efforts towards development of fusion power.&nbsp;
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards Agency activities, a unique feature was the
organisation of an Industrial Forum in January this&nbsp; year.&nbsp; It
is very important that we harmonise and focus the promotional efforts being
made by the private sector, governments, and intergovernmental and international
organisations in the field of nuclear power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Measures taken
in this direction will have a catalytic effect in boosting and reinforcing
the efforts by each body individually, in its own right, for the common
good.
<p>16. Under the auspices of IAEA, several mechanisms currently&nbsp; exist
for facilitating information exchange and co-operative R &amp; D activities,
among interested Member States, in areas relating to peaceful applications
of nuclear energy.&nbsp; It has often been felt that the existing mechanisms
have some limitations, particularly those linked to inadequate funding,
which restrain a desirable expansion in the reach, range and volume of
such programmes.&nbsp; This is evident from the fact that several recommendations
made in various IAEA symposia, AGMs, Consultants’ Meetings etc., cannot
be expeditiously followed up by the Agency on account of budgetary constraints.
<p>17. While participating in the Industrial Forum, I had suggested a new
mechanism for international co-operation termed “Innovative Technology
Development Nucleation Programme” (ITDNP).&nbsp; In my opinion, the new
mechanism, if adopted, could be of great benefit both to the Agency and
the concerned Member States interested in coming together to pursue joint
R &amp; D programmes without imposing any significant financial burden
on the Agency.
<p>18. The Agency had placed before the Board of Governors a draft Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) between the IAEA and the OECD/NEA this year. The
senior Experts Group, of which I was a member, did speak of enhancing synergies
in the field of nuclear energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I wish to stress that synergies
can be strengthened only in an atmosphere of&nbsp; transparency. We sought
clarifications in the draft which would eliminate any chance of adverse
discrimination to Non-OECD members of IAEA through application of the MoU,
in particular the need to examine how the confidentiality clause of the
NEA impacts on information available to non-OECD members.&nbsp; It is important
that any such confidentiality clause should not cause non-OECD members
to be denied a part or all of the information relating to an item of co-operation
under consideration.&nbsp; Our worry was that whatever co-operation was
carried out under the auspices of the MoU should not be considered by the
NEA to be confidential.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the purpose of the co-operation
is lost when we are merely presented the results of the activities, without
being privy to the scientific and technological effort by which the results
were arrived at. In any joint venture of this nature, each party shares
its expertise and co-operates to achieve the common goal. Therefore, one
can understand this MoU addressing specific activities pertaining to areas
of common interest and co-operation but not single Agency activities.&nbsp;
Each Agency is responsible for its own activities in accordance with its&nbsp;
statutory functions.&nbsp; In our opinion, therefore, this MoU should avoid
mentioning “single Agency Activities”.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>19. India has consistently supported the Technical Cooperation activities
of the Agency. As in the past India is pleased to pledge in full its share
for the Technical Cooperation Fund 2001 and payment will be made on time
as always. In addition, we are assisting, through expertise and equipment,
two ‘footnote-a’ projects in Sri Lanka and have also offered our partnership
in the establishment of a nuclear programme in that country. Regarding
the funding of technical cooperation activities, we have participated in
the consultations with Co-Chairpersons, the Ambassadors of Finland and
Mexico. India played a key role in assisting the previous Chairman, the
Ambassador of Netherlands, in arriving at the Indicative Planning Figure
(IPF) in 1998. At that point we had explored with the Ambassador of the
Netherlands the possibility of including the TC Fund as a part of the regular
budget to make the resources for the TC Fund predictable, assured and adequate.&nbsp;
However, no conclusive decision could be arrived at on this difficult issue.
Regarding the assessed programme costs, we have always been of the view
that without any exception, recipient States should pay at least the minimum
assessed programme costs for it is only a fraction of the benefit that
accrues to them.
<p>20. We would like to underscore that the prime issue was that all Member
States should pledge and pay in full, especially the major donor countries.
Instead, we see a widening gap between pledges and actual contributions.&nbsp;
We on our part always pledge in full and pay in time. Although the contribution
to the TC has been regarded as voluntary, it is based on the Resolution
passed by the General Conference of the IAEA.&nbsp; To this extent, TC
Funding should be regarded as morally obligatory if not mandatory.&nbsp;
There is the need for the Agency to orient its TC programmes in such a
way as to promote self-reliance among developing countries rather than
reliance on developed countries. We had called on the Agency to identify
centres of excellence for human resources development under the Technical
Cooperation for Developing Countries (TCDC) programme and had offered our
training facilities to scientists and engineers from developing countries.
In this regard, in a signal event this year the DAE signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) with the IAEA for cooperation in connection with
the Agency’s regional and interregional training events, individual and
group fellowships training programmes carried out as part of the Technical
Cooperation activities of the IAEA.&nbsp; The MoU is an important milestone
in our relationship with the IAEA and formalises our longstanding offer
to make the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) a “centre of excellence/Regional
Resource Unit (RRU)” under the Agency’s Technical Cooperation for Developing
Countries (TCDC) programme.
<p>21. The Safeguards Department has indicated that new measures such as
remote&nbsp; monitoring and satellite transmission under the Model Additional
Protocol are not expected to reduce costs.&nbsp; Indeed, costs are likely
to go up, at least in the short term, as a result of more countries adhering
to the Model Additional Protocol and the increased verification demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The “bulge” in safeguards expenditures was expected to ease off and later
reduce once the integrated safeguards system along with the Additional
Protocol was implemented by the Agency.&nbsp; However, the Safeguards Department
has indicated now that actual efficiencies and streamlining of safeguards
following the implementation of integrated safeguards needed to be studied
to determine the future trends and there is no certainty of any reduction
in costs; on the contrary, costs are likely to increase.&nbsp;
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is need to see an improvement in quality in the
implementation of safeguards.&nbsp; We need to examine whether the present
system of safeguards is the best that we can devise.&nbsp; Much has changed
in technology since 1971 when the new inspection regime was put in place.&nbsp;
This should be reflected in the quality and quantity of inspection effort,
with corresponding reductions in cost. The argument that increases in safeguards
need to be accommodated automatically because these are mandatory requirements
under agreements as required under the NPT brings into question the differences
between statutory activities and mandatory activities.&nbsp; With promotion
being the prime statutory aim of the IAEA, we wonder why only 5.9% of the
budget goes for an important activity like nuclear power.&nbsp; On the
other hand, there seems to be no holding back of resources for safeguards
activities, with a call now for the extrabudgetary contribution also to
be incorporated into the regular budget.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such actions would
further hurt promotional activities.
<p>23. We reiterate our appreciation of the Agency’s efforts in preventing
illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Yet, in our neighbourhood, clandestine
acquisition of sensitive technology and materials is known to have occurred.&nbsp;
Preventing this&nbsp; requires the commitment of Member States of the Agency.
Both on the issue of physical protection measures and export controls,
India follows a stringent law based system which is borne out by its exemplary
record.
<p>24. The stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, in the custody of
those who were the first to build up such deadly arsenals, remain at alarmingly
high levels. Our own policy is based on responsibility and restraint and
we continue to press with undiminished commitment for universal, verifiable
nuclear disarmament, even while safeguarding our strategic space and autonomy
in decision-making.&nbsp; International peace cannot be divorced from the
need for equal and legitimate security for all.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>25. Scientifically speaking, we move into the new millennium in 2001.&nbsp;
The new century must cause us to pause, to rethink our strategies, and
to examine&nbsp; our options.&nbsp; We need a fresh look at the importance
of nuclear power.&nbsp; We need to shake off the fetters of prejudices
and apprehensions that have led to public fears of this very important,
indeed crucial technology.&nbsp; The concerns about nuclear power stem
primarily from fears about safety of reactors, and concerns over management
of long-lived radioactive wastes. These worries are exaggerated, since
technological solutions are available for addressing both these issues.&nbsp;
Let us pool our collective wisdom and scientific knowledge and work together
to address the challenges of global development through deployment of nuclear
technologies overcoming the barriers that come in the way.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Thank you, Mr. President.
