<p>Leader of the ASEAN Senior Officials' delegation, His Excellency, Datuk
Abdul Kadir Mohamad, the Deputy Secretary General of ASEAN, His Excellency,
Dato Ahmad Mokhtar Selat, our esteemed colleagues from the ASEAN countries,
Ladies and Gentlemen-&nbsp;
<p>I am extremely happy to be here today to inaugurate the third ASEAN-India
Senior Officials' Meeting.
<p>Since its inception in February, 1998, the SOM has become an important.
and effective institution for the political, economic and security dialogue
between India and the ASEAN countries.&nbsp;
<p>Our first meeting in 1998, in New Delhi, was followed by the second
in February 1999, in Singapore. Both these meetings were held in an atmosphere
of cordiality and constructive openness. It is against this backdrop, and
the growing substance and meaning of India's dialogue partnership with
the ASEAN, now in its fifth year, that we approach this latest in the series
of our Senior Officials' Meetings. I am optimistic that this latest round
of our dialogue will further qualitatively enhance the content and utility
of our interaction. I, therefore, warmly welcome all our ASEAN colleagues
and friends to this meeting.
<p>I thank Secretary General Datuk Abdul Kadir Mohamad of Malaysia, the
Country Coordinator, for ably steering the process of our preparations
for this event. We appreciate the efforts made by Malaysia, on behalf of
the ASEAN, in this regard. India looks forward to working closely with
Malaysia in the latter's important role as ASEAN's Country Coordinator,
for India. We would also like to place on record our sincere appreciation
of the positive role of Singapore which facilitated India's participation
as a Dialogue Partner in ASEAN in 1996, and for its excellent stewardship
of this dialogue process until July 2000.&nbsp;
<p>The importance of our meeting can be gauged from the fact that the SOM
provides substantive back-up and support to all the mechanisms for ASEAN-India
cooperation like (1) the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conferences, (2) the meetings
of the ARF, (3) the Joint Cooperation Committee, and (4) the Working Group
on Trade and Investment, and (5) the Working Group on Science and Technology.
<p>India regards ASEAN as its neighbour, sharing as it does, a land boundary
with ASEAN. For centuries our peoples have interacted with each other,
and the confluence of our historical and cultural ties has created a natural
sense of affinity and empathy between us.
<p>Today, we are infusing a fresh sense of purpose into this age-old relationship
through our cooperation, and dialogue, on commercial, economic, political
and strategic issues, and our ever-growing people-to-people ties. We share
a common stake in building a future for our region that is built on the
bedrock of peace, development, and economic prosperity.&nbsp;
<p>In recent months, India has intensified its high-level contacts with
ASEAN countries. The President of India, Shri K.R..Narayanan, visited Singapore
in November, 2000. Our Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has just
visited Vietnam and Indonesia, and will be visiting Malaysia in February.
<p>Speaking in Indonesia during his recent visit, our Prime Minister, Shri
Atal Bihari Vajpayee stated that India greatly values its cooperation with
ASEAN and that we share ASEAN's vision of prosperity through expanded regional
integration. He said that the countries of ASEAN and India have a common
interest in maintaining peace and stability in the region and beyond. Speaking
in Vietnam, he referred to the fact that history and geography have willed
us to draw closer to each other in the new century to promote peace, stability,
security and sustainable cooperation among countries in Asia. We share
natural synergies in practically all spheres. There are traditional spiritual
bonds between us, our friendship is rooted in shared values, which owe
their continuity to our civilisational affinity.
<p>Friends, since December, 1999, the Presidents of Vietnam and Indonesia,
and the Prime Ministers of Singapore and Cambodia have visited India. General
Maung Aye, Vice Chairman, State Peace &amp; Development Council, of Myanmar
was also in India recently. Our External Affairs Minister has visited Singapore,
Vietnam and Lao PDR over the last few months, while the Thai and Malaysian
Foreign Ministers visited India in July and October 2000 respectively.
Her Royal Highness, Princess Hajah Masna, Ambassador-at- large, Brunei
visited India in April 2000. The visit of the Secretary General of ASEAN,
Mr. Rodolfo Severino to New Delhi, to deliver the ASEAN-India Eminent Persons
Lecture, last week also served to highlight the importance of our relationship.
Mr. Severino, in his remarks, eloquently referred to ASEAN-India ties as
a "Partnership for our Time".&nbsp;
<p>These high-level visits are clearly illustrate that both India and ASEAN
recognize the value and importance of their growing ties, and increased
convergence of our outlook on many issues of mutual interest and concern.
For India, the prosperity and stability of Southeast Asia is of crucial
importance. The Post Ministerial Conferences --or PMC 10+10 and the PMC
10+1 have become important fora for India and ASEAN to share views on a
number of issues.&nbsp;
<p>Our dialogue partnership has positive implications also for the larger
strategic interests of Asia. India became a member of the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) in 1996. We value our membership in the ARF, and see it as
a way to fashion a pluralistic, cooperative security order that is reflective
of the diversity of the Asia Pacific region. Our participation in ARF is
in consonance with our "Look East" policy. We consider ASEAN as the driving
force of the ARF, and believe that the ASEAN way of "dialogue and consensus"
should remain the guiding principle of ARF.
<p>India shares maritime boundaries with several ASEAN countries, and a
land and maritime boundary with Myanmar. It is therefore natural that India
seeks to promote wider and deeper contacts with ASEAN countries within
the ASEAN and ARF frameworks to promote both economic development and peace
and security in the region. ASEAN has acknowledged the positive role that
India can play in the region.
<p>The fact that the economies of the ASEAN countries have resolutely weathered
the economic crisis of 1997 and 1998 is an extremely positive and reassuring
development. It is also important to note that the lessons learnt from
that crisis are enabling the region to put in place mechanisms that will
prevent a repetition of those events. What the crisis taught us was that
as globalisation integrates markets and generates economic opportunities,
it also brings in its tow elements of economic instability, especially
interest and exchange rate fluctuations, and volatile global currency flows.
ASEAN emerged from that crisis because of the strong macro-fundamentals
of the economies of the region, and the inherent dynamism, discipline and
collective will of its people and governments.
<p>India's trade with ASEAN is picking up after the downturn during the
econornic crisis of 1997-98. Our total trade turnover with ASEAN during
1999-2000 amounted to 7.35 billion U.S. dollars. There has been a growth
in Indian exports to Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
Vietnam and Myanmar. It is our aim that the total volume of India-ASEAN
trade should increase both in terms of quantity and value, as it is nowhere
near reaching its full potential. At present we have trade agreements and
related institutional arrangements with Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam,
Malaysia, Myanmar and Lao PDR. A Trade Agreement with Brunei is also under
consideration. We must tackle infrastructural constraints such as the non-availability
of direct shipping and air-links to some of the countries in the region.
Our future trade strategy should involve increased official and business-level.
interaction, as well as increased activism on the part of the ASEAN-India
Working Group on Trade and Investment. The ongoing study on ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA)-India trade linkages, being financed from the ASEAN-India
Fund, is to identify critical areas of cooperation, suggest mechanisms
for information sharing and ways and means to facilitate trade and investment
flows, increasing market access to each other's products, services and
investment, and product cooperation in the areas of customs matters, standards
and quality and Intellectual Property Rights protection. We must also have
increased participation in trade exhibitions and fairs held in our region.
India is to participate in the Sixth ASEAN Science and Technology Week
to be held in Brunei Darussalaam in September, 2001. I hope the SOM will
generate new ideas about injecting further economic content into our partnership
to fully meet the needs of the new regional and global context.&nbsp;
<p>Our economic relationship with ASEAN also encompasses an active investment
component. ASEAN businesses are undertaking Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
into India in crucial infrastructural sectors like telecom, fuels, hotel
and tourism services, trading, heavy industry, chemicals, fertilizers,
textiles, paper and pulp, and food processing. Similarly, liberalized economic
and financial policies in India have encouraged Indians to increasingly
invest in South East Asia.&nbsp;
<p>Since the last PMC in Bangkok in July 2000, we have engaged in a useful
and comprehensive interaction in the field of human resource development
at the ASEAN-India Workshop on this subject in New Delhi in October. The
Workshop identified thrust areas including accreditation and quality assessment,
information technology and management to give impetus to ASEAN-India cooperation
in Human Resource Development. We agreed that centers of excellence such
as the Indian Institutes of Technology and Management would explore the
possibility of faculty and student exchanges with ASEAN universities. We
also agreed that the creation of centers of research on South Asia and
ASEAN Studies would receive priority. India is also receiving nominations
from the ASEAN countries for 100 training slots in training courses in
management, banking and finance, urban development, education planning
and labour relations.&nbsp;
<p>The special strengths that India and ASEAN share in information technology
are a particular focus of our attention. In July 2000, India completed
the 6-week training of 94 ASEAN candidates in advanced software and networking
techniques. We have aptly identified Electronics and Information Technology
as a Sub-group under the ASEAN-India Working Group on Science and Technology.
The private sector from India is also expanding its activities in this
sector in the ASEAN countries. In Indonesia, for instance, there are three
Indian software companies who are offering training courses. We would be
happy to receive an IT delegation from the ASEAN countries to explore new
avenues for cooperation in information and communication technologies that
hold the key to our future prosperity and development. In this context,
we also view the setting up of the ASEAN e-Task Force with considerable
interest. I am sure there is ample justification for India's association
with the e-Task Force, given the positive character of our mutual collaboration
in the field of information technology. India and ASEAN can jointly leverage
their IT strengths to implement projects in e-governance, IT education
and training, and the multimedia industry.
<p>I am also happy to report that an initiative by India and five ASEAN
countries, namely Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia, to
promote tourism, cultural and educational interaction, has borne fruit
with the conclusion of the Vientiane Declaration on Mekong Ganga Cooperation
in November, 2000. The bridge between South Asian and South East Asian
economies is also being reinforced through our cooperation in BIMST-EC.&nbsp;
<p>Transportation and infrastructure is another important area of our cooperation.
We hope that the setting up of the ASEAN-India Working Group on Transport
and Infrastructure will be completed soon, given the pivotal role of transport
and infrastructure in our economic development.&nbsp;
<p>The experience and insights gained from our Dialogue Partnership over
the last few years have greatly enhanced the levels of mutual trust and
confidence in our relations. The structure of our relationship is built
on firm and solid foundations. In this, the first ASEAN-India Senior Officials'
Meeting of the New Millenium, let us resolve to quicken the momentum of
our cooperation initiatives, and our multi-faceted partnership. I wish
the deliberations of the Meeting, every success.&nbsp;
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;
