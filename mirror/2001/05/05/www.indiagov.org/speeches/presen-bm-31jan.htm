<p>Starting from somewhere around the early nineties, if you opened any
newspaper, magazine or journal in Europe or North America, and saw an article
about Asia, you knew it was about a region including China, Japan, Korea
and the ASEAN countries (then not including the Indochina countries or
Myanmar). The Asian success stories were from these countries. Discussions
about the Asian ethos or Asian values revolved around the culture of these
countries. The mystique of the Asian inscrutability and the power of the
oriental philosophy were analysed deeply to discover in them the source
of the extraordinary economic and technological advances made by these
countries.&nbsp;
<p>India, whose civilization and culture are as ancient, which has roughly
40% of the population of what atlases call Asia, and which first tried
- as far back as in 1947 - to define the Asian identity of the free countries
of the continent, did not figure in this definition of Asia.&nbsp;
<p>Three years ago, when the same region went through a period of economic
turmoil, it was described as the "Asian" crisis, totally obscuring the
fact that many Asian countries - whether by sound economic policies or
by luck - had largely escaped the more virulent manifestations of the financial
virus.&nbsp;
<p>The point I am making here is not purely one of nomenclature. The whole
Asian continent cannot be so simply analysed with uniform and internally
self-consistent economic, cultural or political yardsticks. The diversity
of the continent defies such monochromatic characterization.
<p>Asia is more than half the world. It is the largest and most populous
continent, with nearly 60% of the global population. Eight of the ten most
populous countries are in Asia. Several of the great ancient civilizations
originated in the continent. Almost all the world's religions - Hinduism,
Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism, etc. - originated
and continue to thrive in Asia.
<p>This cultural heterogeneity coexists with a widely differentiated pattern
of economic development - a legacy of different experiences of colonialism
and of Cold War economic arrangements. This means also that, unlike in
North America or South America or in Europe or Africa, where single overarching
security frameworks exist, Asia cannot be defined within a single security
paradigm. The security concerns of West Asia (what you would call the Middle
East) are addressed very differently from those in Central Asia, South
Asia, Southeast Asia, or East Asia. The <i>inter se</i> relationships between
Russia, China, Japan, India, ASEAN, Central Asian Republics and the Gulf
countries have been in a state of some flux in the Cold War period and
its immediate aftermath and this has obviously affected the security environment
in the continent.&nbsp;
<p>It is important to remember that Asia has four declared nuclear weapon
states and a fifth tacitly acknowledged one, some of the largest standing
armies of the world, non-Asian navies operating freely in Asian waters,
and a large number of missile producing and exporting countries. Asia's
military spending has actually increased sharply after the Cold War.&nbsp;
<p>The political scene in Asia has been transformed significantly in this
period. The most dramatic event in this transformation was the collapse
of the Soviet Union. Russia has, however, shown over the recent years that,
despite its economic setback, it will retain its global role. The internal
political consolidation, the emergence of a firm leadership committed to
core national interests, and a turnaround in its economy are all positive
indicators that Russia is on the recovery path.&nbsp;
<p>In the Asian context, the rapid growth of Sino-Russian political, economic
and military relations has important consequences. Russia also has a major
role to play in Central Asia, where it has vital interests.
<p>India-Russia relations have strengthened their multidimensional character.
Our declaration of a strategic partnership during President Putin's visit
to India in October last year was a positive contribution to the matrix
of regional stability in Asia.&nbsp;
<p>China has always been a major military and economic power in Asia. We
have been following with much interest the debate in academic circles in
the West - and the ambivalent posture of some of its policy makers - on
whether or not China's economic and military strength is a factor of stability
in Asia. I do not want to enter into this debate. But it is a self-evident
fact that as the world's most populous country and as a permanent member
of the UN Security Council, China's participation is an important requirement
in any viable Asian security framework. Its profile in military alliances
and its commitment to existing nuclear and missile technology transfer
regimes would be important indicators of the directions that its role would
take in this venture.&nbsp;
<p>Japan remains an economic superpower, in spite of the recent setbacks
of the "Asian crisis". It is in an introspective phase, but has the potential
to change course and become a dominant military power in the continent.
Published statistics show Japan's military expenditure - about US $50 billion
- is among the largest in the world. Japan's evolving engagement with Russia
and China, in the background of its undiminished military alliance with
USA is another crucial factor in the Asian security equation.
<p>The countries of ASEAN have registered rapid economic growth in the
past two decades. The end of the Cold War, however, altered some of the
basic security assumptions of the region. ASEAN has responded with political
maturity, and is today an important element in Asia's larger regional and
global security engagement. The enlargement of ASEAN to include the Indochina
countries and Myanmar and the broad-based approach to security through
expansion of the ASEAN Regional Forum have moved ASEAN steadily towards
a larger Southeast Asian and East Asian community.
<p>In West Asia, the yearning for peace is clearly visible. But the issues
involved are highly emotive and complex. Nevertheless, a peaceful resolution
of the conflicts in the region is a <i>sine qua non</i> for Asian security.
Tied to this is, of course, the question of oil security.&nbsp;
<p>Iran is in the midst of a socio-political and economic transformation.
Reconciling tradition with modernity is the major challenge; indications
are that there is a groundswell of pro-reform sentiments especially among
the younger generation in that country. Iran's improvement of relations
with Saudi Arabia, Russia and west European countries is a stabilizing
development. Iran also has an important role in Central Asian security.
President Khatami's proposal for a "dialogue of civilizations" provides
a framework for engagement with Iran.&nbsp;
<p>After years of isolation, Iraq is on the verge of resuming normal international
interactions, as the sanctions wear out. We should not ignore the fact
that Iraq is one of the most influential of Arab countries; its isolation
is unnatural and the UN sanctions regime requires urgent review.&nbsp;
<p>Central Asia has produced the most recent crop of newly independent
countries. These countries face daunting challenges of socioeconomic development
and nation building. At the same time, the region is also blessed with
vast reserves of natural resources, which can transform the lives of its
inhabitants. However, the competition for hydrocarbons and the politics
of pipelines may generate destabilizing tensions. Religious extremism and
ethnic separatism are also real threats.&nbsp;
<p>Thus there remain a number of question marks on the future security
and stability of the Asian continent. Non-military threats like religious
extremism, drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism exacerbate
the situation. Poverty and shortages of food and energy threaten the stability
of societies and new nation states. Unchecked population growth and the
debilitating effects of communicable diseases like AIDS and TB are factors
of concern. Territorial disputes bequeathed by colonialism and aggravated
by the Cold War add to this already rich cocktail.&nbsp;
<p>India is located in the geographical midst and the political centre
of this volatile continent. We have the undoubted strengths of a functioning
vibrant democracy, a well-established economic reform process underway
for over a decade, and a network of cordial relations with most countries
and groupings in the continent. Our approach seeks to counter immediate
military threats to stability even while tackling the non-military threats
to long-term security.&nbsp;
<p>In our immediate neighborhood we have been forced to develop a minimum
nuclear deterrent We have explained the security imperatives that led to
our decision. Here in Europe, NATO continues to exist long after the collapse
of its adversary. If even in this benign security environment and amidst
unprecedented economic prosperity a powerful military alliance is still
required with hi-tech weaponry and nuclear forces, the security imperatives
that India faces should be easy to understand. We are happy that there
is a much better understanding today in the international community of
India's viewpoint in this matter.&nbsp;
<p>We strongly reject club-based technology denial regimes as instruments
to promote security. Though ostensibly meant to deny dual-use technologies
to nuclear aspirants, these regimes often promote hidden commercial motives
and adversely affect genuine requirements of developing countries for socio-economic
development. The regimes have failed miserably in controlling proliferation
and transfer of nuclear weapons and missiles in Asia. They have not adequately
dealt with missile proliferation linkages across regions. By penalising
genuine importers of development technology and condoning clandestine transfers
of offensive technology, these regimes actually worsen the security picture.
<p>Besides the response of military self-defence and nuclear deterrence
to our security environment, we have also given high priority to resolving
outstanding problems with our immediate neighbours and to increase our
level of engagement with other major countries which have a role in promoting
stability in Asia. We have sincerely tried to resolve our problems with
Pakistan. The initiatives that the Prime Minister of India has taken in
the recent past have led to a significant reduction in firing along the
Line of Control and the International Border with Pakistan. Our latest
decision to extend by yet another month the suspension of actions against
militant groups demonstrates our sincere effort to go the extra mile in
search of a peaceful solution. But terrorism and violence continue unabated
and there is no indication that Pakistan is inclined to give up its hostility
towards India.
<p>We have a close dialogue with Russia, ASEAN, China, Iran and other countries.
We have a regular security dialogue with several nations including China
with which we are also holding discussions on clarification of our borders.
One round of security dialogue was held last year. Rakesh Sood, Joint Secretary
(Disarmament) was present. Another one will be held on February 8, in a
few days' time. We intend to deepen our security dialogue with other countries
of the region.&nbsp;
<p>We believe that the strengthening of regional cooperation both for security
and for economic development is a crucial input in the promotion of regional
stability. We are members of SAARC, BIMSTEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.
A relatively new grouping - the Shangai-5 - has also been moving in the
right direction towards fostering cooperation and reducing tension in Central
Asia, which is a region of strategic importance for us.&nbsp;
<p>The financial and economic crisis in South East Asia in 1997 vividly
demonstrated the relationship between globalisation, development economics
and security. The crisis itself showed the pitfalls of a headlong rush
into globalisation and liberalization without taking local socio-economic
realities into account. The recovery experience of various countries has
further shown that countries would have to choose their own pace of globalisation
and that prescriptions from world financial institutions are not necessarily
the best way to secure political and economic stability. Our economic engagement
with Asian countries and groupings is firmly based on this recognition.
We seek a dialogue bilaterally and multilaterally with other countries
of the region to harmonise our position on key issues of development, trade
and investment and environment.&nbsp;
<p>We have laid great stress on confidence building measures in the security
field. The Indian Navy has friendly contacts with several navies of the
region. With the multiple overlap of maritime economic zones of different
countries of the region, cooperation against sea piracy and misuse of marine
resources is important. The Indian Navy is hosting in Mumbai next month
an International Fleet Review, "Bridges of Friendship", which seeks to
foster friendship among the navies of different countries. We also support
greater openness in military affairs through greater contacts among security
establishments. Incidentally, it is not very well known that Directors
General of Military Operations of India and Pakistan have regular telephone
conversations on the hotline every Tuesday. They must have taken place
yesterday at 12 o'clock our time. They can also have unscheduled conversations
at the request of either party.&nbsp;
<p>India has been active in sensitizing other countries in the Asian continent
to the menace of international terrorism, drug trafficking and organized
crime. Cooperation among ourselves, to expose the linkage between the three
and to counter the threat, is sorely needed. According to a recent report,
Afghanistan now produces nearly 80% of the world's opium, leading to heroin
production worth about US $ 100 billion. Much of the rest of the world's
opium is produced in Myanmar. The implications are obvious. India has proposed
a UN Convention on Terrorism. It can only be a first step towards closer
coordination among countries in the Asian continent against terrorism fuelled
by drug trafficking and organized crime.&nbsp;
<p>These are some ideas aimed at promoting Asian stability. They need to
be fleshed out and constantly updated through bilateral and multilateral
discussions, which would generate political confidence building measures
to overcome mutual suspicion and distrust. Balanced economic growth with
regional economic integration, and a multipolar political order rooted
in pluralism are the prerequisites for a stable security equilibrium in
Asia. India is committed to working with other Asian countries for this.&nbsp;
