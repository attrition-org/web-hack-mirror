<P>Mr. President,</P>

<P>May I congratulate you on your election to the Presidency of the 53rd
UN General Assembly? We wish you well in our shared endeavors in the United
Nations and offer you our full cooperation. We would like to thank your
predecessor for his engagement and contribution and to compliment him for
the work throughout the last year.</P>

<P>I first addressed this august Assembly of the UN as Foreign Minister
in 1977. Since then I have had the privilege to come for the General Assembly
sessions for many years but it was without ministerial responsibility.
I acknowledge with gratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.
To me it also signifies the consensus on national interests and the foreign
policy of India. When I addressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was
the turning point in many ways in the history of India. The Janata Government
was a coalition of many factions who united in the restoration of our people’s
faith in democracy. Since then we have had many changes of Government but
the people's political awareness and their faith in the institutions which
uphold our constitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when I come
to this podium as Prime Minister I come on behalf of another coalition.
India has demonstrated that democracy can take root in a developing country.
I am confident that the Indian experience will prove that democracy can
also provide the basis for stable, long-term economic growth in developing
societies. This is the path that the people of India have chosen and I
stand before you today as the symbol of this new resurgent India.</P>

<P>Mr. President, the world of the 1970's has receded into history. The
shackling constraints of the Cold War are gone. The distinguishing feature
of the last two decades has been the spread of democracy worldwide. By
force of example, we have been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.
From this flows our desire to see democratization of the UN itself. An
International body that does not reflect, and change with, the changing
international realities, will inevitably face a credibility deficit. We,
therefore, support a revitalized and effective UN, one that is more responsive
to the concerns of the vast majority of its member States and is better
equipped to meet the challenges ahead of us in the 21st century.</P>

<P>The Security Council does not represent contemporary reality; it does
not represent democracy in international relations. Following the end of
the Cold War, it has acquired the freedom to act but experience shows that
the Council has acted only when it was convenient for its permanent members.
The experience of Somalia does not do credit to the Security Council and
there are other examples too. Peacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection
of ulterior political priorities and perceptions.</P>

<P>There is only one cure - to bring in fresh blood. The Security Council
must be made representative of the membership of the United Nations, Developing
countries must be made permanent members. It is a right to which the developing
world is entitled.</P>

<P>Presence of some developing countries as permanent members is inescapable
for effectively, discharging the responsibilities of the Security Council
particularly when we see that the Council acts almost exclusively in the
developing world. It is only natural that on decisions affecting the developing
world, these countries have say, on equal terms. Along with other measures,
the Security Council too must be reformed, expanding its non-permanent
membership so that more developing countries can serve on it. But this
alone is not enough. Because as long as effective power in the Council
rests with the permanent membership, the interests. of the developing world
will not be promoted or protected unless developing countries are made
permanent members, on par with the present permanent members. Only this
will make the Council an effective instrument for the international community
in dealing with current and future challenges, The new permanent members
must of course have the ability to discharge the responsibilities that
come with permanent membership. India believes it can, and, as we had said
before from this rostrum, we are prepared to accept the responsibilities
of permanent membership, and believe we are qualified for it.</P>

<P>It will be a great day when democracy becomes the universal norm, and
when the UN reflects this democracy in its institutions and functioning.
However, open democratic societies have one scourge to contend with - terrorism.
The challenge before countries like mine and other democracies is to maintain
our openness, safeguard individual rights, and, at the same time, give
no quarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have recounted the
terrible toll, worldwide, that terrorists have exacted, taking advantage
of he trust that characterizes open societies. I recall that the G-7 Summit
almost two decades back had identified terrorism as one of the most serious
threats to civilised societies. Events since then including the blowing
up of Air India Kanishka, the Pan Am Airlines over Lockerbie, to the recent
bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam - have only established the correctness
of that judgment.</P>

<P>Mr. President, terrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.
Terrorism takes a daily toll across the world. It is the most vicious among
international crimes, the, most pervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat
to the lives of men and women in open societies, and to international peace
and security. In India, we have had to cope with terrorism, aided and abetted
by a neighboring country, for nearly two decades. We have borne this with
patience, but none should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush this
challenge, its tentacles have spread across the world, Today, it has linkages
with illicit trade in drugs, arms and money laundering. In short, terrorism
has gone global and it can only be defeated by organized international
action.</P>

<P>Let us make up our minds once and for all – terrorism is a crime against
humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly stand scrutiny in an open society,
let alone in the eyes of the international community. It should be the
primary task of all open and plural societies to develop collective means
for tackling this menace. At the summit meeting in Durban, the Non-Aligned
Movement has called for an international conference in 1999 to develop
such a collective response. We urge that the 1999 conference launch the
process of negotiations for an international convention to provide for
collective action against States and organizations which initiate or aid
and abet terrorism.</P>

<P>In this fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
there is a growing realization that economic, social, cultural, civil and
political rights form a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years
by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees amply reflect the vicious cycle
of how violations of economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead
to violations of civil and political rights. In defining its index, the
Human Development Report gives a higher weightage to economic criterion
for developing countries; this weightage is reduced for developed countries,
highlighting the importance of the right to development for developing
societies. It is therefore a matter of concern that the absolutism sought
to be advocated in the promotion of human rights is often at the cost of
the right to development.</P>

<P>India has ratified both the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights and the Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions
in our country - the National Human Rights Commission, a free media, an
independent judiciary - all serve to assure that the international human
rights statutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remained convinced
that unless progress is made on economic, social and cultural rights including
the right to development, the world will continue to witness international
conflict leading to migrations, displacement of people and human rights
abuses.</P>

<P>In the closing years of the 20th century, the challenge of nuclear disarmament
is another of the priorities facing the international community. We have
successfully prohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent decades.
The present century has witnessed the development and the tragic use of
nuclear weapons. We must ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass
destruction is not carried into the next century.</P>

<P>For the last half-century, India has consistently pursued the objectives
of international peace along with equal and legitimate security for all
through global disarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of
our national security. India has, over the years, sought to enhance its
notional security by promoting global nuclear disarmament, convinced that
a world free of nuclear weapons enhances both global and India's national
security.</P>

<P>The negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) began in
1993 with a mandate that such a treaty would &quot;contribute effectively
to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the process
of nuclear disarmament and therefore, to the enhancement of international
peace and security&quot;. India participated actively and constructively
in the negotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a disarmament framework
by proposing its linkage with a time-bound program for the universal elimination
of all nuclear weapons.</P>

<P>It is a matter of history that India's proposals were not accepted.
The treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted by India on grounds of national
security. We made explicit our objection that despite our stand having
been made clear, the treaty text made India's signature and ratification
a pre-condition for its entry into force.</P>

<P>Mindful of its deteriorating security environment which has obliged
us to stand apart from the CTBT in 1996. India undertook a limited series
of five underground tests, conducted on 11 and 13 May, 1998. These tests
were essential for ensuring a credible nuclear deterrent for India’s national
security in the foreseeable future.</P>

<P>These tests do not signal a dilution of India’s commitment to the pursuit
of global nuclear disarmament. Accordingly, aftar concluding this limited
testing program, India announced a voluntary moratorium on further underground
nuclear test explosions. We conveyed our willingness to move towards a
de jure formalization of this obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India
has already accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In 1996, India could
not have accepted the obligation as such a restraint would have eroded
our capability and compromised our national security.</P>

<P>Mr. President, India, having harmonized its national imperatives and
security obligations and desirous of continuing to cooperate with the international
community is now engaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range
of issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring these discussions
to a successful conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is
not delayed beyond September 1999. We expect that other countries, as indicated
in Article XIV of the CTBT, will adhere to this Treaty without conditions.</P>

<P>After protracted discussions, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva
is now in a position to begin negotiations on a treaty that will prohibit
the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is a partial
step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded and enters into force,
will not eliminate existing nuclear arsenals. Yet, we will participate
in these negotiations in good faith in order to ensure a treaty that is
non-discriminatory and meets India's security imperatives. India will pay
serious attention to any other multilateral initiatives in this area, during
the course of the negotiations in the CD.</P>

<P>As a responsible state committed to non-proliferation, India has undertaken
that it shall not transfer these weapons or related know-how to other countries.
We have an effective system of export controls and shall make it more stringent
where necessary, including by expanding control lists of equipment and
technology to make them more contemporary and effective in the context
of a nuclear India. At the same time, as a developing country, we are conscious
that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful applications and we shall
continue to cooperate actively with other countries in this regard, in
keeping with our international responsibilities.</P>

<P>A few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in Durban, India proposed
and the Movement agreed that an international conference be held, preferably
in 1999, with the objective of arriving at an agreement, before the end
of this millennium on a phased program for the complete elimination of
all nuclear weapons. I, call upon, all members of the international community,
and particularly the other nuclear weapon states to join in this endeavor.
Let us pledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium, it shall
be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall never again be subjected
to the use of threat of use of nuclear weapons.</P>

<P>Mr. President. the decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of expectations;
nowhere is this more apparent than on the global economic scene. The sense
of triumphalism that heralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving
way to caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian flu is
now spreading to other continents.</P>

<P>The hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would foster economic development
with the global financial markets adjusting the exchange rates stands falsified.
What we have seen is the growth of a large volume of &quot;virtual money&quot;
that has not been generated by productive economic activity. But the power
of the &quot;virtual money&quot; is real, evident in the fact that national
regulatory mechanisms are unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement
in and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run does not follow
economic logic but rumor and sentiment with results that are self-reinforcing.
In developing countries and in western financial capitals, there is now
a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has
been a primary cause of the current crisis.</P>

<P>Does it mean that the world should turn back from globalization? Our
answer is an emphatic NO. Rising economic inter-dependence is a phenomenon
driven by the technological imperative, but we must learn how to manage
the change, India has not been affected as severely as some other countries,
largely because we adopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop
in commodity prices, by 30 per cent in a year and a reduction in net capital
flows by 50 percent to the emerging markets will have a negative impact
on growth everywhere, including in the developed world.</P>

<P>I must emphasize that democratically elected leadership in open developing
societies, such as India, also faces another challenge. We cannot let an
unbridled free market system aggravate existing economic and social disparities.
In fact, we need policy instruments to reduce disparities thus creating
a more stable environment in the long term. Such policies are necessary
in accountable democracies and in no way inconsistent with managed liberalization.</P>

<P>It is high time, Mr. President, that we begin a new international dialogue,
on the future of a global and Inter-dependent economy. This is a task for
the sovereign states represented here and cannot be left solely to the
dynamics of an unregulated market place.</P>

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, I think I speak for all of us when I
say that we are on the threshold of a new age. This is an over-used phrase,
but we are all aware trial an exciting new universe is within our reach.
Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton described his scientific discoveries
as pebbles on the beach, while the Ocean of Truth lay undiscovered. It
was modest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but I believe
that we are now actually sailing in the Ocean of Truth. We have made exciting
discoveries and will make many more which will move humankind forward.</P>

<P>And yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not well. The world
is not at ease with itself. Forces are bubbling under the surface tranquility
in almost all parts of the world that threaten the gains of the last century,
and which seek to lead the world towards, bigotry, violence and unhealthy
exclusivism.</P>

<P>India has a message: not a new one, for almost all religions have expressed
the thought before. But we have preserved the tenets - of freedom, equality
and tolerance in our daily lives. If the world of the 21st century is to
be a better place than the world we have seen so far, these values must
prevail. History also shows that these are easier to prescribe than to
observe. And yet, as we move towards ever-closer interdependence, there
is no alternative. The world and its leaders must summon the will to rise
to the occasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is the task
before us and I declare India's readiness to make its full contribution
in the testing times ahead.</P>

<P>I close with an ancient sloka from the Rig Veda composed thousands of
years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest language in the World:</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/s.gif" ALT="sloka" HEIGHT=174 WIDTH=177 ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM></P></CENTER>

<P>&quot;Svastir manushebhyaha Oordhvam Jugatu beshajam Sam no astu dvipathe
Sam chathusthpate Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti&quot;.</P>

<P>Meaning:</P>

<P>Let all human beings be blessed with prosperity, Let all flora and fauna
which are life line of all creatures, grow abundantly, Let there be harmony
with all two-legged creations, Let there be harmony with all four-legged
creations, Let there be peace; peace, peace. (OM Shanti, Shanti, Shanti.)</P>

<P>Thank you, Mr. President.</P>
