<p>Honourable Heptulla, Deputy Chairperson of Rajya Sabha,&nbsp;
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,&nbsp;
<br>Friends,&nbsp;
<p>It gives me great pleasure to visit India, an enchanting country, again
at the beginning of the new century and new millennium. On behalf of the
Chinese people, I would like to extend cordial greetings to friends old
and new who have, over the years, cared for the friendly relations and
cooperation between China and India, and send best wishes to the industrious
and talented Indian people.&nbsp;
<p>As history turns a new page, people around the world are reviewing the
past and looking to the future.&nbsp;
<p>In the 20th century, mankind experienced two World Wars. Despite this,
the vehicle of history was moved forward. That India and China won national
independence and liberation was two epic achievements of the century.&nbsp;
Mankind created unprecedented civilizations and enjoyed fast growth of
social productive forces driven by revolution of science and technology
in the past century. Now, we are ushering in a better and more prosperous
era.&nbsp;
<p>With great confidence in the new century, we in China hope that the
coming century will be one in which people of all countries will be blessed
with 'peace' and development and one in which different civilizations can
learn from each other and develop hand in hand.
<p>In today's world, there are two prominent trends: one is gradual multi-polarisation
in the international political pattern and the other is increasing globalization
of the world economy. The major task facing the people of the world is
to promote the process of multi-polarity for world peace and ride the tide
of globalization for common development so that a just and fair international
new political and economic order can&nbsp;
<br>be established in the new century.&nbsp;
<p>Multi-polarity represents an inevitable trend of the current international
relations, and serves world peace, stability and democracy. We maintain
that all countries, regardless of size, wealth and strength, are equal
members of the international community and entitled to equal status, rights
and interests. People of each country have the right to choose for themselves
a social system and road of development in light of the country's conditions
and features. Given the complexity of international affairs, it is unfair
and impossible for them to be dictated by a country or a few countries.
They should instead be addressed through consultations among all countries.
Global challenges need to be met by countries working together. The world
destiny should be in the hands of world people.&nbsp;
<p>Being an unavoidable reality in the world economy today, globalization
may facilitate each country's efforts of broadening sources of investment,
introducing advanced technology and drawing upon managerial expertise.
Developing countries can also take advantage of the opportunities brought
by globalization, tap the potential of a late- starter and accelerate economic
development. Of course, the negative impact of globalization must not be
overlooked. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening in a global
context. Contradictions between the North and the South are put into sharp
relief. Developed countries are at an advantage in the process of globalization,
while developing countries are faced with grave challenges in safeguarding
their economic sovereignty and security. Globalisation should benefit the
whole world. We need globalisation that leads to a win-win situation, allows
co-existence and promotes common development of both developed and developing
countries. The international community should work hard to make sure that
globalisation leads to balanced, stable and sustainable development of
world economy.&nbsp;
<p>In the great cause of seeking world peace and promoting common development
of mankind, China and India shoulder heavy responsibilities and have made
their due contribution to the world. Forty-seven years ago, Premier Zhou
Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru jointly initiated the five principles of
mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual
benefit and peaceful coexistence. This is an evergreen tree growing out
of oriental civilization and the spirit of the times. Mr. Nehru said, "If
these principles were recognized in the mutual relations of all countries,
then indeed, there would hardly be any conflict and certainly no war."
Mr. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that: "the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
are the best approach to handle state-to-state relations. A review of the
practice in international relations reveals that these principles are most
dynamic." After being put to practice for a few decades, the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence not only have been widely accepted as basic principles
governing international relations, but will also serve as an important
foundation for a new international political and economic order.&nbsp;
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,
<br>Friends,
<p>The Chinese and Indian people enjoy a long lasting friendship. In ancient
times, our ancestors braved hardships, climbed mountains and crossed rivers
to promote exchanges between the two great civilizations. They left a brilliant
chapter in the world history of cultural exchanges. Kumarajiva and Bodhidharma,
both prominent Indian monks, travelled eastward and brought the Chinese
people authentic Buddhist sutras. Prominent Chinese monks Fahien and Huen
Tsang travelled westward to the land of Buddha and left for the Indian
people precious records of ancient Indian history and culture. In modem
times, people of our two countries sympathized with, showed understanding
to and supported each other in the fight for national independence and
liberation. We in China will never forget Dr. Kotnis, who sacrificed his
young life for the liberation cause of the Chinese people.&nbsp;
<p>We feel propelled by history to build on the existing basis laid by
our ancestors and. add new chapters to China-India friendship. Chinese
leaders said in the 1950s that "India is a friendly country to China. It
has been so for more than 1,000 years. And we believe it will continue
to be so in the future".
<p>We are required by reality to elevate China-India relations to a new
height in the 2st century. As our common ground far outweighs our differences,
the Chinese and Indian peoples have ample reason to develop friendship
and become good neighbours and good friends.&nbsp;
<p>Being the two largest developing countries in the world, China and India
have extensive common interests in international political and economic
arena. We both favour a multi-polar world, hold identical or similar positions
on many major issues and can cooperate in a wide range of international
affairs. Both facing the difficult task of modernization and rapidly improving
living standards, we, as two neighbouring&nbsp;
<br>countries, need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment and need
to live in amity, which is in our fundamental interests. Similar national
conditions and similar endeavour to carry out comprehensive economic reform
make it possible and necessary for our two countries to learn from and
draw upon each other in many fields.&nbsp;
<p>During President Jiang Zemin's visit to India in 1996, the two sides
agreed to establish a constructive partnership of cooperation oriented
towards the 21st century, thus charting the course for the future of China-
India friendship. Last year when President Narayanan visited China, the
two countries reaffirmed that China and India do not take each other as
a threat or adversary and reiterated their continued adherence to the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The two Presidents also reached extensive
agreement on ways to promote friendly ties and co-operation between the
two countries. All these constitute a foundation and provide guarantee
for the sound growth of China-India relations.
<p>Here, I wish to take this opportunity to brief you more on some basic
points of China's policy towards India.
<p>We place emphasis on keeping good-neighbourly and friendly relations
with India. Developing such relations with India, an important neighbour
of China, is our consistent guiding principle and an essential part of
China's foreign policy of peace with surrounding countries. We have never
taken India as a threat. Nor do we intend to pose a threat to other countries
or seek any sphere of influence.&nbsp;
<p>We wish to expand trade and economic cooperation with India. Although
there has been much headway in our trade and economic relations in the
past decade as evidenced, among others, by the 10-fold increase in two-way
trade volume, our current level of cooperation is far from commensurate
with the scale of our respective economies. There is still huge potential
yet to be tapped through our concerted efforts.
<p>We stand ready to strengthen cooperation with India in international
affairs.&nbsp; Fully affirming the cooperation our two countries have conducted
in international political and economic fields, we hold that China and
India, the two largest developing countries, have the obligation and capability
to work more actively to play their due part in the international arena.&nbsp;
<p>We attach importance to enhancing mutual understanding and trust with
India. We agree that China and India are still lacking in mutual understanding
and to achieve better understanding and trust is a pressing task in our
bilateral relations. While not shying away from the problems and differences
between us, we hope that far-sighted statesmen of our two countries will
demonstrate courage and will and make efforts to resolve these problems
and differences. At the same time, we believe that problems of this kind
or another, including those left over from history, should not become impediments
to the growth of our bilateral relationship and that the positive development
of our ties will create more favourable conditions for the ultimate resolution
of those problems and differences.
<p>China wishes to see a prosperous, developed and strong India and welcomes
a more active role of India in regional and international affairs. We have
noticed with pleasure that over the past ten years Indian economy has obtained
an average annual growth rate of 6% and its IT industry has developed rapidly,
with its software industry taking the forefront of the world. China wishes
to express its congratulations to India on its success in various fields
over the past five decades since its independence, and we appreciate your
efforts in safeguarding the rights and interests of developing countries.
<p>China is willing to maintain and develop good-neighbourly and friendly
relations with all countries in South Asia. As a country adjoining the
South Asian region, China sincerely hopes to see enduring peace, stability
and development in the region where all countries can treat each other
as equals, live in harmony and resolve disputes peacefully through dialogue.
China supports all efforts that are conducive to peace and stability in
South Asia and the process of regional cooperation therein.
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,
<br>Friends,&nbsp;
<p>Like India, China experienced sufferings and humiliation inflicted by
Western powers in modem history. The Chinese people, led by the Communist
Party, staged persistent and unrelenting struggles for liberation and national
independence. History suggests that only when national sovereignty is free
from violation and society free from instability, can people concentrate
their attention on developing the economy, building national strength and
improving living standards.&nbsp;
<p>In its 50-year history, New China has made marked progress in economic
development. Especially in the past two decades and more since Mr. Deng
Xiaoping's reform and opening-up policy was launched, China enjoyed phenomenal
economic progress with its GNP growing rapidly at an average annual rate
of 9% and the living standards of its people improving as well. Now in
China, the economy grows in a sustainable way, reform is deepened continuously,
people are content with their life and work and the aggregate national
strength is modestly strengthened. Nevertheless, China is still a developing
country. This is our basic national condition. In order to realise modernisation,
the Chinese Government has formulated a three-stage development strategy.
The objectives of the first two stages have been realised. For the third-
stage, we will catch up with medium-level developed countries in terms
of per capita GNP by the middle of this century, achieve modernisation
by and large and turn China into a prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally
advanced socialist country.&nbsp;
<p>We have three major tasks in the new century, namely, to continue the
modernisation drive, to realise national reunification, and to safeguard
world peace and promote common development. China is now working on the
draft of a new Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development.
According to our plan, China's GDP will keep an average annual growth rate
of more than 7% and GDP in 2010 will double that of the year 2000. People
will lead a more comfortable life then and a system of socialist market
economy will be in place. China will continue to implement the policy of
"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" and make active efforts
to push forward the reunification of the motherland. The development of
China will benefit the Chinese people and contribute to peace and development
of the world rather than constitute a threat to any country. China is opposed
to hegemonism and will never seek hegemony itself. As a responsible big
country, China will unswervingly adhere to the independent foreign policy
of peace in a bid to make greater contribution to the mankind.&nbsp;
<p>In the past 20 years or more since China started its opening-up and
reform, we have all along made it a basic state policy to develop socialist
democracy and improve the socialist legal system. The system of people's
congresses, as the fundamental political system of China, embodies extensive
democracy for the people and represents the fundamental interests of the
entire Chinese people. It plays an important role in boosting economic
development and social progress in China. China has never stopped its efforts
to reform the political system while conducting reform of the economic
structure. In the future, China will continue to improve its democracy
and legal system and strengthen the system of people's congresses and enforce
the policy of ruling the country according to law. On the basis of full
guarantee of people's right to subsistence and development, the extensive
rights and freedoms of the people will be ensured according to law. Human
rights and democracy will be respected and the sound development of China
be sustained with social stability maintained. Despite different political
systems in China and India, the National People's Congress of China and
the Indian Parliament can learn from each other and contacts between the
two parliaments can boost the friendship and co-operation between the two
countries and the two peoples.&nbsp;
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,
<br>Friends,&nbsp;
<p>China and India have fostered splendid ancient civilisations and once
were the locomotives for Asia's long-time lead in the world. But in modem
times, Asia lagged behind. It has started its great rejuvenation since
the second half of the 20th century and China and India along with other
Asian countries share the obligation for the future of Asia. In the new
century, let us make joint efforts to build China and India into prosperous,
strong, democratic and culturally advanced countries. And let us work hand
in hand for peace and development in Asia and the world at large.
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;
