<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mr. President,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is a particular pleasure to see you presiding
over the last United Nations General Assembly of the 20th century. And
I consider myself as singularly fortunate, also greatly honoured to be
representing my country, India, on the occasion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. I do believe that in the many years that you
spent here pursuing the dream of independence for your people, and which,
happily is now a reality, you, more perhaps than others have seen the UN
at its best. That is why the perspective that you bring to the office of
the President, enriched as it is by living through the very articles of
faith of the UN, is near unique. I am sure we will all profit from it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. I take this opportunity to also warmly welcome
three new members to the UN: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. I have no doubt
their presence shall enrich our deliberations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4. Even as I address this Assembly the century
draws to a close, the world prepares to meet AD 2000. It is only appropriate,
also instructive, therefore, to look back and to reflect upon the journey
that humanity set upon, a hundred years ago. Where did we think we were
then headed, and where have we actually reached? Could any then foresee
what 1999 would bring? Thus, are there, in the passage of these years that
have gone by, any landmarks that could indicate a path for our future?
For that we need to assess the 20th century, and there is but one yardstick
by which we can judge: the criteria of the stated objectives of the United
Nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. Indisputably the 20th has been the bloodiest
of all centuries. But, in contradistinction, it has also been a century
of the most profound transformations, of the most significant social, political
and technological advancements. This, above all, has been the century of
the ascendancy of the individual, of democracy. It is that period in which
dynasties vanished and revolutions swept empires off the face of ancient
lands; centuries-old colonialism became history against the irresistible
heave of the colonised, to reclaim their lands, their souls, so that oppressed
humanity could regain a voice in its say in its own political and economic
destiny. It is the century in which we plumbed the depths of the oceans,
soared into the infinities of space; when man first set foot on the moon,
reached Mars and even deeper into the recesses of the unknown. In a wired
up world, the computer has today become what the fountain pen was in the
early years of the 20th century. The revolution of the digital has arrived.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6. Humanity today is healthier, better fed, more
sheltered than our forefathers were. But want and hunger, disease and deprivation
are still widespread, including in developed societies, too. We have at
our command more information than ever before but are we that much wiser?
Literacy has spread but is mankind better educated? We are more connected
globally but are we as humankind? Has this linkage and interconnection
reduced conflict and animosity?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">7. And thus the tabulation of our assets and liabilities
of this century flows.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">8. As we improved upon and added to almost everything
that we inherited in 1900, so most sadly have we, to violence, too. This
century has been the most bloodthirsty, perhaps because it is in the last
hundred years that humanity employed science to perfect means of killing
as never before. Our passage has seen us move from the Gatling gun to a
world menaced today by MIRVs. That early machine gun, the then great mower
down of the early 1900s, seems today almost a toy by comparison. We have
split the atom but employ the released energy less for peace, more for
weapons of unimaginable destruction. Chemical defoliants and sophisticated
biological weapons are also this century's contribution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">9. The century that passes experienced not two
but three great wars. Each was a cataclysm, fought globally and at enormous
cost. When the First ended, the survivors emerged from the trenches, searching
for a better world, so that war did not recur. In response, we created
the League of Nations. But war, regrettably, was not avoided. The League
failed because we had failed the League. And thus followed the Second great
war, at the end of which the world emerged armed with weapons that could
destroy all that human genius and ingenuity had created and every vestige
of life. But, from the ruins and devastation of the second, also emerged
the United Nations, with mandates of broader powers and responsibilities.
The third great conflict was the Cold War. This deeply affected, shaped
and influenced the development of the United Nations. This war, too, extracted
a heavy price, directly and through proxy conflicts, also political and
social upheavals, but then these became its epilogue. What significance
lies in the observation that no global peace conference has taken place
to mark the end of this last war?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">10. The United Nations could have been cast anew,
made contemporary, democratized, drawing upon our collective experience
to tackle new challenges with greater responsiveness. Can we, even now,
do something, in this last UNGA of this millennium, to correct this? Can
we pledge afresh to invest this institution with faith, commitment, political
will and the resources that it needs to make it the vehicle capable of
realizing the aspirations of all humanity; an instrument that will steer
planet Earth into the next century?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">11. We do not enjoy an abundance of options. The
sapping of the vitality, or the diminishing of the centrality of the United
Nations, must not be permitted. We have, 'but one Earth', and there is
but one United Nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">12. Another development of this century, of crucial
significance, is the transformation that we have experience in the role
of the State. From an agency that controlled and regulated all spheres
of human activity we move into a phase wherein the State must become more
supportive, caring and encouraging of the citizen's individual and collective
endeavours; it must release, not contain the energies and genius of its
people. It would be an error, however, to assume that the days of the State
are over. The state continues to have a crucial role and relevance. Also,
therefore, national sovereignties. The UN was not conceived as a super
State, it will not ever become so, principally, because there is no viable
substitute to the sovereign State. Even globalization can but work through
state intermediaries only. To diminish, marginalise or to ignore the state
would also be bad practice, because the weaker the State is rendered the
less shall it be able to promote the interests of its citizens. The state
needs to be strengthened functionally, not weakened. Besides, it is axiomatic
that a United Nations of weak nation states can only be a weak United Nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">13. Mr. President, globalization is an idea that
has re-emerged, but also its reverse - fragmentation. The first is politico-economic,
the second entirely political. Let us dwell a bit on it. Obviously, the
technology that is driving this process can now scarcely be unlearnt; the
speed of travel and of communications will only increase; the age of the
digital has dawned. However, though globalisation may apparently be driven
by impersonal market forces, it is in reality impelled by power seeking
political and financial advantage. It is, in essence, a political process,
and if history teaches us anything it is that such process are not linear.
Simply in terms of economic indicators, the world was as globalised at
the turn of the century as it is now. A backlash followed; barriers went
up, confrontation replaced cooperation, and the world jostled into the
tensions that led to the first great War. Are we for the sake of temporary
gain, perhaps even unwittingly, repeating yesterday's mistakes? Political
hindsight tells us that globalization has to be politically directed for
creating equal economic opportunity, both within States and among States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">14. In India, we cherish the creative genius of
the people. We do believe that Indian excellence lies in the freedom of
the individual. We do not subscribe to constricting choice through State
impositions. But can 'free markets' offer true freedom of choice to those
that are not even a part of the market? That is why the State continues
to have the responsibility to protect the needy, to strengthen the weak.
That is a part of our democratic creed, too. We note that human rights
have been made a cross-cutting theme of the work of the United Nations.
That is important. The flowering, however, of human rights requires economic
development and growth because many of the deprivations faced by individuals,
whether in the developed or in the developing world, are rooted in marginalisation
created by poverty. We believe, therefore, that development should be the
cross-cutting theme of the United Nations, and that the multilateral development
system, which has been one of its successes, must be strengthened, its
focus narrowed to the core challenges of economic growth with social justice,
and given the resources it requires to respond to the needs of the developing
countries. The international community will find that no investment yields
better returns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">15. I have the honour to address you as a representative
of the largest democracy in the world. Even now, as I share these thoughts
with you, an electorate of around 600 million, matching the combined populations
of the US, Canada and West Europe goes through the exciting process of
democratically electing its next government in my country. It is an awe-inspiring
spectacle, this unstoppable flow of the great Ganga of Indian democracy.
It is a democracy whose economy grew by over six per cent last year, even
in the aftermath of the major shocks to the international economy brought
about by what was described as the 'East Asian meltdown' of the mid-1990s.
We move with the challenges posed by globalization, without either retreating
into a fortress India, or abandoning our social objectives. We have worked
out our own answers and devised our own policies to meet these new challenges.
Because we hold that the sheer diversity of mankind dictates differences
in approach, in their respective search for relevant alternatives. A truth
borne out by the fact that the 20th Century has been witness to the detritus
of many false certainties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">16. Today, when capital moves without almost any
constraint, it is virtually impossible for developing countries to resist
either its demands or manage the consequences of its sudden departure.
Let us reflect upon the absence of order, system, or any global oversight
upon currency flows, particularly short term flows; even as we attempt
to bring order and equity in trade in goods, services and commodities.
But how are we to address the problem when currency, instead of being a
vehicle of trade, has in itself become a commodity of trde, when the volume
of trade in currency - daily - has outstripped global trade in goods and
services or even global GNP, manifold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">17. If globalization is to benefit all, and as
we simply cannot accept that wheels of progress should grind down the common
man, then surely some new international regulation, some order is needed
here. Let the UN take the initiative to urgently hold an international
conference on Financing for Development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">18. In the political domain too, managing change
demands openness and reasoned discourse, an essential ingredient of which
is abjuring violence. That is why terrorism is the very anti-thesis of
all that the UN represents and stands for. Terrorism is the great global
menace of our age. In this age of democracy, it is a violation of the very
basic precepts of it. Because its principal targets become the innocent,
it is a crime against humanity, a violation of basic human rights. It is
also now a grave threat to international peace and security. That is why
I urge that we strengthen international consensus against terrorism. India
has given a call for a comprehensive international convention against terrorism.
We hope to make progress on the issue in this session of the General Assembly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">19. We also know how terrorism uses the international
financial system, how it exploits the breakdown of countries and societies,
and how it has preyed on the nexus between drugs and proliferation of small
arms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">20. Thus, today, we witness a scimitar of narco-terrorism
cutting across the Caucasus to the South Asian sub-continent. Two of the
world's largest sources of illicit drugs flank us. Terrorism financed by
drugs has for years been the deadly export of our neighbours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">21. Here the crippling intermixing of cause and
effect is cruelly exemplified in Afghanistan. The world has been witness
to the decades-old distress of the innocent men, women and children of
the country. The disorders of Afghanistan, and the near anarchy into which
that country has been pushed is a consequence, chiefly, of the play of
external forces; and of a reversion to medieval fundamentalism of the most
obscurantist variety. This disorder now overspills, it is also exported.
It is not that human rights, particularly of women and children, are routinely
violated there, they simply do not exist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">22. Our relationship with this neighbour is ancient
and rooted in a past that we share. That is why we urge this Assembly to
be seized of the enormous human suffering of the Afghans, and to encourage
and support the early formation of a government, truly representative of
all sections of that society and country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">23. Terrorism is a menace to which open societies
are vulnerable; it becomes particularly difficult for democracies to counter
when terrorists are armed, financed and backed by governments or their
agencies, and benefit from the protection of state power. Cross-border
terrorism, sponsored from across our borders, has taken the lives of thousands
of our citizens, and ruined those of countless others. We will counter
it, as we have done over the past decades, using the methods available
to a democracy. India will defeat such forces. That is both our duty and
our obligation to our citizens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">24. Earlier this year India was subjected, yet
again, to an act of premeditated aggression.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">25. In February this year, hoping yet again to
set aside the sterility of relations of the past half century, to set the
South Asian sub-continent on the path of development, with a view to addressing
the real adversary of our region - poverty, want and hunger - Prime Minister
Vajpayee extended a hand of peace, amity and cooperation to neighbouring
Pakistan. The pathbreaking bus journey from Delhi to Lahore followed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">26. In Lahore were concluded a triad of agreements
amongst which was the Lahore Declaration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">27. It was the route chart of moving towards lasting
amity and peace. This act of faith was betrayed. A premeditated aggression
by regular forces was committed against India. Not simply was the Lahore
Declaration violated, but also the Simla Agreement, which had prevented
conflict for more than a quarter of a century. In self-defence, yet with
utmost restraint, India took all necessary and appropriate steps to evict
the aggressing forces from its territory. Most regrettably, this aggression
has set back the Lahore process of peace that we had initiated; for whereas
aggression over territory can more easily be vacated, that territory of
trust which has been transgressed is infinitely more difficult to restore.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">28. Permit me Mr. President, to draw attention
to the fact that this aggression upon India in Kargil was a demonstration
of wanting to hold to ransom the world, through an act of aggression. It
was also a manifestation of the larger disorders that the owrld has been
witnessing in Afghanistan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">29. There is an aspect that I stress. It is of
the gross violation of Geneva conventions when Indian soldiers taken prisoner,
were tortured, subjected to inhuman treatment and killed in captivity.
These violations took place at a time when the international community
has repeatedly been trying to establish the rule of law, and stripping
away the layers of impunity that have protected those who give the orders
that lead to violations of international humanitarian law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">30. And it is thus, Mr. President, that I find
it necessary to reiterate some essential verities of Indian nationhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">31. From the earliest days of our struggle against
imperialism and colonial rule it has been an unquestionable article of
faith with us that India is one nation: a nation of many faiths, a diversity
of beliefs, a cultural harmony arranged through the interplay of myriad
forms and manifestations but it is a unity, strengthened by its pluralism,
that is beyond question. And of this is born India's democratic vitality,
too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">32. Also of this oneness and unity the Indian
State of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part, and shall remain so. Because
this is not any territorial dispute; it is the assertion of two antipodal
approaches to national identity. India has never represented denominational
nationhood it is civic nationalism to which we subscribe. That is why Jammu
and Kashmir is not a so-called &quot;core issue&quot;, it is at the very
core of Indian nationhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">33. Yet, the path of the India-Pakistan composite
dialogue process is open. No preconditions attend it. The only essential
ingredient that remains is abjuring of violence and cross-border terrorism;
principles that are integral to both the Simla Agreement and the Lahore
Declaration; indeed the very process of peace itself. This process needs
to be resumed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">34. We have been greatly disappointed by this
compulsive hostility of Pakistan, because it is an aberration in our region
today, where all the other SAARC countries are at peace with each other,
and trying, bilaterally and through the SAARC mechanisms, to tackle together
the great challenge of development. But we remain unshaken in our vision
of cooperation and shared prosperity of the South Asian region, as embedded
in the Charter of SAARC, also our faith in the ability, talent and will
of the people of the region to take their rightful place in the world community.
The destiny of all our peoples is linked. It is a region with a collective
history reaching back to the beginnings of human history and of the highest
civilisational accomplishments. In striving to attain the promise of the
future in our region, we also see the recovery of a great past.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">35. This is perhaps the right juncture at which
to say a few words about pluralism in an age of globalisation. Though we
find sterile the debate over universal and regional values, extreme positions
are still taken on both sides. In a spirit of engagement, we would urge
our partners in the West to be a bit more tolerant, a bit more introspective.
While all democratic governments try to promote good governance, human
rights and social responsibility, the perspective they approach them from,
and their ability to implement them, vary. Rigidly applying, as a universal
paradigm, value systems that reflect the state of western economies and
societies in the late twentieth century, produces an inevitable reaction,
which does not make either for dialogue or constructive decisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">36. Globalization has also influenced our thinking
on security issues by generating a greater awareness about new security
concerns. Equally important, with the end of the Cold War there is a growing
realization that peace cannot be maintained through &quot;balance of power&quot;
or &quot;hegemonic order&quot;. To maintain global peace and security,
to deal with threats of a global nature, the international community has
to accept the concept of collective security. The United Nations provides
a framework for such a contract among nations. With the Cold War behind
us, the General Assembly should reactivate this framework.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">37. Global nuclear disarmament was the objective
set out by the 1946 General Assembly in the first resolution that it adopted.
This objective still beckons us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">38. I say this as the representative of a country
that has been obliged to acquire nuclear weapons because of the failure
of the existing non-proliferation regime to address our primary security
concerns. Yet, let me also state with full conviction that India's commitment
to global nuclear disarmament stands undiluted. India is the only nuclear
weapons state ready to negotiate a Nuclear Weapons Convention that will
prohibit forever the development, production, stockpiling, use and threat
of use of nuclear weapons and provide for the elimination of all existing
weapons under international verification.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">39. If this can only be a step by step process,
the first step at a technical level is for all countries possessing nuclear
weapons to undertake measures that will reduce the dangers of, and provide
added safeguards against, any unintended or accidental use; coupled with
this is the political step of re-orienting nuclear doctrines, towards a
no-first-use, and then non-use, thus de-legitimizing nuclear weapons globally.
Independent expert opinion across the globe has spoken strongly in favour
of such measures. In fact, every single study that has been published since
the end of the Cold War on the measures to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free-world
has highlighted the need for shifting to doctrines based on no-first-use
and non-use, and technical measures towards de-alerting, as the inevitable
first steps in the process. We have taken initiatives to urge the international
community forward on both counts and hope that in this General Assembly,
the Indian initiatives will receive the unanimous support that they merit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">40. Last year, my Prime Minister declared in this
Assembly that India was engaged in discussions on a range of issues including
the CTBT. These discussions are in process and will be resumed by the newly
elected Government. Our position remains consistent. We remain ready to
bring these discussions to a successful conclusion. Naturally, this requires
the creation of a positive environment as we work towards creating the
widest possible consensus domestically. We also expect that other countries
shall adhere to this Treaty without any conditions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">41. Notwithstanding India's readiness to engage
in constructive negotiations on a treaty to prohibit the future production
of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices,
the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has so far, sadly, been unable
to register any forward movement. This, too, is something to ponder over
for we all know that an FMCT can only contribute to our shared objective
as part of a step by step process. Let us then overcome this reluctance
and agree to look beyond the FMCT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">42. So, at the end of this centennial audit, what
is it we would want the United Nations to do in the first few years? It
is clear that there are two major problems facing the UN as an institution:
Security Council reforms and the UN's financial crisis. These need to be
addressed. The Security Council must be made more representative, with
developing countries inducted as permanent members, to reflect the changes
in the UN membership and today's political realities. As we have said earlier,
on any objective criteria, India's credentials for permanent membership
are persuasive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">43. Sustainable and environmentally sound development
is a goal to which India continues to attach the utmost importance. In
2002, we will complete a decade of 'Agenda 21' adopted at the Rio Earth
Summit, in 1992. I trust that the current Session of the General Assembly
will put in place a preparatory process for the 'Rio Plus 10' review. This
will enable the Member States to take stock of the implementation of the
commitments undertaken by the Member States in 'Agenda 21' over the past
decade. Such a process is vital for attaining our common goal of sustainable
and environmentally sound development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">44. This century has shown us that our challenges
are common, they are intertwined. Problems flow across boundaries, they
batten on each other. Political, security, economic and social challenges
are braided around each other; when they form a knot, that has to be cut
by all of us together. Here, and nowhere else, can we do this. It is convenient
to look at security issues in the First Committee, at economic in the Second,
at human rights and social in the Third, and so on, but we often do not
see them together, and so fail to use the UN as we should.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">45. May I, in conclusion, therefore, propose,
Mr. President, that in the next decade, the United Nations endeavour to
address the most urgent problems that face us today. We have to do this
as a unity: of nations as also of issues, for it is evident that solutions
in one field would depend on, or be facilitated by, progress in another.
Without tackling them together, we will fail to address them at all. Therefore,
may I urge this Assembly to consider the following areas for action in
the opening years of the next decade:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- An international conference on Financing for
Development; - Binding, irreversible steps to reduce the dangers of use
of nuclear weapons; - Reform and expansion of the UN Security Council;
- A comprehensive Convention Against Terrorism; - Strengthening of the
UN development system in this era of globalisation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">46. I leave you, Mr. President, distinguished
delegates, with a sloka from the <I>Rigveda</I>. Though written five thousand
years ago, it reaches across time to us as we prepare for this General
Assembly. In translation, it reads:</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Be of one heart, one mind, and free of
hate. <BR>
Let your aim be common, your assembly common, United, your mind and thoughts;
May you make your resolutions with one mind, <BR>
Perform your duties righteously.<BR>
Let our hearts be together.</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thank you, Mr. President. </FONT></P>
