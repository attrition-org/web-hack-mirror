<br>I am happy to welcome all of you to this Seminar on the subject of
'State Sovereignty in the 21st Century: Concept, Relevance and Limits'.
<p>The subject of the Seminar is indeed topical.
<p>The increasing pace of globalisation, modern means of communication,
the breath taking reach and possibilities of information technology, the
power of the media and public opinion have all challenged the traditional
notions of state sovereignty and the hitherto unchallenged primacy for
national governments in dealing with internal affairs.
<p>The end of the Cold War, following the dissolution of the former Soviet
Union, has given rise to a new debate on unipolarity versus multipolarity.
The tendency to impose solutions unilaterally has come under criticism.
At another level, the process of creation of supranational institutions
in Europe also has implications for the notion of nation states and sovereignty.
<p>The events in some parts of Africa, and in southeast Europe generated
concerns related to genocide, crimes against humanity, egregious violations
of human rights. Suggestions have been made that the international community,
however defined, had the right or the duty to intervene in such situations.
<p>I invite you to examine whether this is an easy principle to apply in
every situation, whether general norms for action in such situations can
be developed, or whether each situation would have to be inevitably assessed
and responded to in view of its own specific and peculiar context.
<p>At the same time, most countries, especially those who have attained
independence in the not too distant past, cherish the principle of state
sovereignty. Narrow and self interests of the proponents of such intervention
can also never be wholly dissociated from any larger humanitarian projections.
However, does sovereignty also need to be balanced by the need to ensure
accepted principles of governance.
<p>It is also worth recalling that the UN Charter empowers the Security
Council to act for the maintenance of international peace and security,
and, interpret for itself what may constitute a threat or breach of such
peace and security. Can a call for humanitarian intervention, bypassing
the Council, be justified on account of the concerns cited, or would it
become a recipe for international political disorder.
<p>Instead of calls for intervention bypassing the Council, as has also
been suggested by several analysts, should the focus be more on the quality
of decisions taken by the Council, its process of decision making, and
its unrepresentative character.
<p>Furthermore, in nascent nation states in the developing world, should
the attention be more on strengthening pluralism and nation building, rather
than external intervention. Would external intervention help the long term
process or would it tend to put stress on the political and social fabric,
and ironically instigate situations which were sought to be cured.&nbsp;
<p>What could, in this context, be the relevance of a positive agenda,
through a global compact to lift developing societies from the devastation
of underdevelopment, and for which national and global responses could
be agreed upon. Would this be better and more effective than a negative
agenda based on intervention and presumption of failure.
<p>With these initial thoughts, I leave you to your well informed and in-depth
deliberations on the subject. All of you have distinguished records of
achievement in your separate fields of diplomacy, academics and journalism.
The subject will benefit from your varied perspectives and in-depth perceptions.&nbsp;
<p>We hope to follow up an this Seminar by an event some months later where
we would also invite participants from some other countries. Our eventual
aim would be to share the product of our discussions with the wider membership
of United Nations.&nbsp;

<p><b>Thank you.&nbsp;</b></td>
