<P><FONT SIZE=+3>U</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>ntil 1991, the Indian economy was
characterised by a highly regulated business environment, a pervasive licence
system and high tariff barriers. Sweeping reforms, introduced in 1991 and
continued by successive governments, have radically changed the course
of the economy. Today the Government's policies are relatively simple,
transparent and geared towards promoting domestic and foreign private investment.
External trade has been liberalised through lowering of tariffs and progressive
reduction of import controls. Tax rates, both corporate and personal, have
been rationalised and compare favourably with other major world economies.
There exists a strong political consensus on the economic liberalisation
policies at the central and state government levels. This augurs well for
the continuation and progressive strengthening of investor friendly policies.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Benefits of the reform process are visible in the form
of better growth rates, higher investment and trade flows in the post liberalisation
era. The inherent strength of the economy is borne out by the fact that
it has achieved a growth of 6.8 per cent per annum over the Eighth Plan
period (1992-97). Foreign trade as a percentage of GDP increased from 14
per cent in 1990-91 to 20 per cent in 1997-98. Cumulative foreign investment
inflows have exceeded US$ 11 billion so far, while foreign currency assets
in March 1998 stood at USS 26 billion, up from US$ 2.2 billion on March
1991.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The recent developments in East and South East Asia as
well as a reduction in agricultural growth and a slowdown in industry in
1997-98 resulted in a decline in the growth rate to 5.1 per cent. However,
the fundamentals of the economy remain strong and a growth of 6 per cent
is expected in 1998-99. The current account deficit, at 1.7 per cent of
GDP in 1997-98, is within manageable limits, foreign exchange reserves
are comfortable and extend to 6-7 months of import requirements. Short
term debt amounts to only 6 per cent of overall debt, while overall debt
itself has declined to 23.8 per cent of GDP in 1998 <B><FONT COLOR="#8C8C8C">(see

It is envisaged that these opportunities would be harnessed through a successful
collaboration of economic policies, private investment and focused government
participation.</FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/ind-b3.gif" ALT="graph" HEIGHT=239 WIDTH=188 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-1>Since
1991, the industrial sector has witnessed positive structural changes,
improvements in productivity, modernisation and infusion of new technology.
Companies have consolidated around their areas of core competence, while
several have tied up with foreign companies to acquire new technologies,
management expertise and access to foreign markets. Consequently, the industrial
sector witnessed an average annual growth rate of 7.3 per cent over the
Eighth Plan period (1992-97). In 1997-98, however, the growth rate fell
to 4.2 per cent. This fall was largely on account of monetary/credit tightening
and a high level of uncertainty in the international environment. The Government
has taken remedial steps to put the industrial sector back on an accelerated
growth path. Steps taken include a cut in personal and corporate income
tax rates, modification of the excise and customs duties to revive the
manufacturing sector and further deregulation of interest rates with greater
freedom to banks to assess credit requirements. The corporate sector was
also allowed free access to GDR/ECB windows to obtain finance at globally
competitive rates. Furthermore, the Government has decided to increase
spending on infrastructure to kick-start the economy and has announced
several measures to increase investment in the sector. The Government is
also keen to promote investments in high growth sectors such as software,
electronics, food processing, engineering, etc. The software industry in
particular has shown great promise and is amongst the fastest growing sectors
with an average growth of well over 50 per cent over the last 5 years.

consonance with the move towards liberalisation and encouraging private
sector investment, the Government set up a Disinvestment Commission in
August 1996, for making recommendations regarding the disinvestment of
equity of select Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). In this context, 50
PSEs were referred to the Commission for its advice. The Commission had
submitted 7 reports covering 41 enterprises till March 1998. Of the 41
enterprises, divestment has been recommended at varying levels for 12 PSEs,
strategic sale of various proportions for 21 enterprises and a temporary
status quo policy for the remaining 8 enterprises. To further expedite
the disinvestment process, the Government in its budget statement for 1998-99
indicated its resolve to disinvest specified portions of equity of Indian
Oil Corporation, Gas Authority of India Ltd., Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd.,
Container Corporation of India and subsequently Indian Airlines. Further,
the Government is to divest minority stakes in PSEs of strategic interest,
while its equity in non-strategic PSEs shall be reduced to 26 per cent.

for the public sector. However, recognising the need for rapid growth and
improvement in the quality of infrastructural facilities, private and foreign
participation is being encouraged through a package of attractive incentives.
With a view to attracting greater investment in infrastructure, the Government
set up the Rakesh Mohan Committee for recommendations to ensure greater
commercialisation of infrastructure alongwith the promotion of public-private
partnerships. The committee estimates total investments in infrastructure
of about US$ 330 to 345 billion over the next 10 years. It is estimated
that over 40 per cent of the total external capital inflows will be directed
towards funding infrastructural capital requirements. </FONT></P>

was set up in December 1997 to channel private capital into infrastructure
projects. The company was established with an equity capital of US$ 238

Bank of India, major Indian financial institutions and international institutions,
such as the Asian Development Bank, Commonwealth Development Corporation,
Government of Singapore, International Finance Corporation, Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell and the Swiss Government hold equity in the company. IDFC aims
to enhance the bankability of infrastructure projects through a variety
of measures such as enhancing credit, stretching debt maturities, etc.
IDFC will help develop the long-term debt market in the country and, through
participation in high level policy advisory boards, help in rationalising
the legal and regulatory framework. In the first year of operation, IDFC
has approved twelve projects; six in telecom, three in roads and one in
ports; aggregating financial assistance of US$ 391 million. Further, it
has also established Policy Advisory Boards in the power and ports sector.</FONT></P>

provides employment to nearly 65 per cent of the working population of
India, its share in the GDP has been declining steadily. The growth in

down from the record production of 199 million tonnes in 1996-97. The decline
in production was on account of adverse weather conditions and production
is likely to improve in the current year. The agricultural strength of
