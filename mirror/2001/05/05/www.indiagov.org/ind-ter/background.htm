<P><FONT SIZE=+1>International terrorism has emerged as a global problem
affecting countries in all regions.</FONT> This is a particularly grave
problem in situations, where terrorism is sponsored by States across national
frontiers against other countries in quest for territorial expansion. The
<A HREF="unga-94.htm">resolution adopted by the Sixth Committee on &quot;Measures
to Eliminate International Terrorism&quot;</A> underlines growing international
consensus to prevent and combat terrorism. India has contributed to strengthening
this consensus. India is party to major international conventions against
terrorism. India has also proposed a <A HREF="intl-conv.htm">Comprehensive
Convention against International Terrorism</A>. The 53rd UNGA gave legislative
mandate to negotiate this convention on a priority basis, after discussions
on the draft conventions against nuclear terrorism and financing of terrorist
activities have been completed. As a country deeply affected by the menace
of terrorism, India stands ready to extend cooperation to UN's efforts
to curb this problem.</P>

<P>Threat of terrorism is no longer limited to a particular country or
region. It transcends international boundaries. Advance in technology and
communications has extended the reach of groups and States sponsoring terrorism.
Sarin gas attack in Tokyo some years ago has raised the danger of weapons
of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists. Terrorists use
electronic media to organise their subversive activities. They have access
to flow of funds from abroad, including money raised through so called
charitable organisations. They enjoy foreign sanctuaries. They are answerable
to none. They violate international standards of human rights, and humanitarian
law, with impunity.</P>

</TD>

</TABLE>

<P>Organised terrorism as an instrument of policy by certain states is
very different in scale, nature and consequences than actions of stray
individuals and groups. Sustained campaign of terrorist violence is not
possible without sanctuaries, training, financing, encouragement and assistance
by States. Government patronage gives terrorist groups and individuals
enormous resources and safe haven. As the object of terrorism sponsored
by States is to destabilise other countries and governments, it poses a
threat to international peace and security.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="unga-94.htm">Declaration on &quot;Measures to Eliminate
International Terrorism&quot;</A> enjoins a positive obligation on Member
States to ensure that not only the government organs do not sponsor terrorism,
but their territory is not used by terrorist groups and individuals. The
argument that a given State was not responsible for actions of terrorist
groups based on its territory, is not tenable. The Declaration also clearly
lays down that acts of terrorism are criminal acts, whatever the underlying
considerations. Support to terrorism in any form - political, diplomatic,
moral or material must be condemned. Nexus between terrorism, fundamentalism
and drug trafficking pose a threat to civil society, democratic pluralism
and human rights.</P>

<P>The problem of international terrorism has to be addressed by strengthening
international legal regime as well as domestic legislation and implementation.
<A HREF="unga-94.htm">The UNGA resolution &quot;Measures to Eliminate International
Terrorism&quot; </A>has urged the Member States to ensure that the jurisdiction
of their courts enables them to bring to trial the perpetrators of terrorist
acts and to cooperate with and provide assistance to other states and relevant
international and regional organisations. The success of this effort requires
political will on part of the Member States.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Existing international conventions against terrorism do not adequately
address the issue of State responsibility to prevent and refrain from acts
of terrorism. This concept is reflected in the Security Council resolutions
imposing sanctions on States accused of sponsoring terrorism. A legal convention
adopted by the UN General Assembly would provide a more broad-based basis
for combating international terrorism and avoid controversies arising from
unilateral action. India has therefore, proposed adoption of a comprehensive
convention against international terrorism. A draft has already been circulated.
During 53rd UNGA session, the Sixth Committee also gave legislative mandate
to negotiate the proposed Convention on priority basis after conclusion
of discussions on draft conventions currently under consideration.</P>

<P>India has played a major part in strengthening international consensus
against terrorism in UN, NAM and SAARC fora. India is party to major international
conventions against terrorism, and has also incorporated them in domestic
legislation:</P>

<P>i) <FONT SIZE=+1>Convention on Offences and certain other Acts committed
on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14th September, 1963.</FONT></P>

<P>This Convention has been given effect to in India by the Tokyo Convention
Act, 1975 (20 of 1975).</P>

<P>ii) <FONT SIZE=+1>Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure
of Aircraft, signed at the Hague on 16th September, 1973.</FONT></P>

<P>This Convention is implemented through the Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982
(Act No. 65) of 1982).</P>

<P>iii) <FONT SIZE=+1>Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against
the Safety of Civil Aviation, concluded at Montreal on 23rd September,
1971 and the 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence
at Airports serving International Civil Aviation Suppression of Unlawful
Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation Act, 1982 (66 of 1982).</FONT></P>

<P>This Convention is implemented through the Suppression of Unlawful Acts
Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act, 1982 (66 of 1982).</P>

<P>iv) <FONT SIZE=+1>Convention on the Prevention and Punishment. of Crimes
against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents,

<P>This Convention is implemented through the provisions of the Indian
Penal Code, 1960.</P>

<P>v) <FONT SIZE=+1>International Convention against the taking of hostages,
adopted in New York on 7th December, 1979.</FONT></P>

<P>This is given effect in India under section 364 A of the Indian Penal
Code, 1960.</P>

<P>vi) <FONT SIZE=+1>UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988.</FONT></P>

<P>This is implemented in India by the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances
(amendment) Act, 1989 which amended the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985.</P>

<P>vii) <FONT SIZE=+1>International Conventions against the taking of hostages,
adopted in New York on 7th December, 1979.</FONT></P>

<P>This is already covered, and implemented under Article 364 A of Indian

<P>This is implemented in India by SAARC Convention (Suppression of Terrorism)
Act, 1993 (36 of 1993).</P>

<P>ii) <FONT SIZE=+1>SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances, 1990.</FONT></P>

<P>Since the provisions are basically based on the UN 1988 Convention,
the provisions of the SAARC Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism
are implementable under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
Act, 1985 as amended in 1989.</P>

<P>India has also played a role in evolving NAM consensus against terrorism.
NAM has unequivocally affirmed that criminal acts intended or calculated
to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons
or particular persons, for whatever purposes, are unjustifiable. XIIth
NAM Summit at Durban in 1998 has also re-affirmed that all Member States
have an obligation to refrain from organising, assisting or participating
in terrorist acts in the territories of other States. The Summit unequivocally
condemned any political, diplomatic, moral or material support to terrorism.
The NAM Summit also called for early adoption and implementation of a comprehensive
convention against international terrorism</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Since 1988, India has suffered total of 45,182 terrorist incidents in
J&amp;K alone. Though in many incidents security forces were targeted but
majority involved attacks on civilians.</P>

<P>Pakistan supported terrorists are also responsible for 2,466 kidnappings
and 791 cases of extortion since 1989 .</P>

<P>Pakistan supported terrorism also resulted in extensive destruction
of property in J&amp;K. There were targeted attacks on educational institutions
(780) in a bid to destroy the modem education system, which the fundamentalist
ideology of the terrorists did not approve.</P>

<P>Since 1988, security forces have recovered very large number of weapons
from terrorists in J&amp;K. This included 889 rocket launchers, 347 rockets,
1525 rocket boosters, 1124 machine guns, 20,193 AK series rifles, 34,141
grenades, 21,332 kilograms of explosives and 1970 bombs. The range and
sophistication of weapons show the intensity of terrorist campaign, which
cannot be sustained without the support of Pakistan (or neighbouring country)
in violation of all bilateral and international commitments.</P>

<P>Pakistan has also supported terrorism in other parts of India. On March
12, 1993, <B>serial blasts in Mumbai</B> resulted in killings of around
260 persons and injury to 700 others. The loss of property was estimated
at Rs. 270 million. According to some of the culprits arrested, 22 persons
involved in the blasts had received training in handling arms/explosives
in Pakistan in February 1993. The weapons and explosives used in the blast
were brought to India by boats which picked up their consignments from
a Pakistan Marine Agency vessel near the Karachi coast. </P>

<P>There were six incidents of hijacking of Indian Airlines aircraft since
the eruption of terrorist activities in Punjab. Attempts were made in all
these cases to take the aircrafts to Pakistan. The hijackers succeeded
in hijacking the aircrafts to Pakistan in two cases. In September 1981,
a Delhi-Amritsar-Srinagar flight was hijacked to Lahore by Dal Khalsa commandos
who demanded the release of Bhindranwale. In August 1982, two flights -
one from Delhi to Srinagar and the other from Jodhpur were diverted to
Amritsar. Two planes hijacked in July and August 1984 ended up on Lahore
and Dubai respectively.</P>

<P>In the August -1984 case, the hijackers were handed over a pistol and
some ammunition at Lahore by the Pakistan authorities. The hijacker was
subsequently repatriated by UAE authorities to India, who handed over the
pistol recovered from the hijacker. Investigations revealed that the pistol
was manufactured in Germany and was part of 75 pistols consigned from Germany
to CAO, PO Box 1040, Islamabad.</P>

<P>A human bomb attack was made on Beant Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab
on August 31, 1995. The attack resulted in assassination of Punjab Chief
Minister, killing of 17 others and injury to many more. The attack was
carried out by a hardcore terrorist group based in Pakistan, where they
were given sanctuary and assistance by the ISI.</P>

<P>Terrorist's trained in Pakistan carried out a series of explosions in
India during 1997. This included 26 explosions in Delhi killing 11 persons
and injuring 241, 5 explosions in Haryana during 1996/97 killing 1 and
injuring 39 and 3 explosions in UP during October 1997 killing 2 and injuring
19 persons. The culprits arrested revealed that they received training
in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.</P>

<P>According to well documented reports from international sources, Pakistan
continues to provide sanctuary to terrorist groups like former Harkat-ul-Ansar
and current Harkat-ul-Mujahidin and Lashkar-i-Taiba, which have threatened
not only targets in India, but also in many other countries. These organisations
enjoy safe haven in Pakistan, openly raise funds and recruit new cadres.
Pakistan has also used Afghan territory and nationals to foment terrorist
activities in India as well as other parts of the world. The <A HREF="unga-94.htm">UNGA
Declaration &quot;Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism&quot;</A>
states that acts of terrorism are criminal acts and unjustifiable whatever
the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial,
ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.</P>

<P>Pakistan's actions are not only violative of the basic norms relating
to conduct of inter-state relations, but also of the bilateral treaty obligations
flowing out of the Simla Agreement and Lahore Declaration. Under the Lahore
Declaration, the two countries have reaffirmed their condemnation of terrorism
and their determination to combat this menace.</P>
