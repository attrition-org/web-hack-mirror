<p>In May, 1998, India conducted five nuclear tests. More than two years
later, the United States, with a record of 949 nuclear tests during the
five decades since Hiroshima, is still enforcing punitive economic sanctions
against New Delhi, poisoning the entire relationship between the world's
two largest democracies.&nbsp;
<p>President Clinton should quietly bury this self-defeating policy when
he meets with Prime Minister Atul Behari Vajpayee at the White House this
week. Pressuring India to reverse its commitment to develop nuclear weapons
merely strengthens Indian hawks who oppose closer relations with Washington
and favor an all-out nuclear buildup that would stimulate nuclear arms
races with China and Pakistan.&nbsp;
<p>The United States should accept the reality of a nuclear-armed India
as part of a broader recognition of its emergence as a major economic and
military power. Such a shift would remove the last major barrier blocking
a rapid improvement in Indo-U.S. relations. President Clinton has kept
up the pressure on India to forswear nuclear weapons despite the fact that
all sections of Indian opinion strongly favor a nuclear deterrent.&nbsp;
<p>Instead of persisting in a futile effort to roll back the Indian nuclear
weapons program, the United States should seek to influence the current
debate in New Delhi over the size and character of the nuclear buildup.
A more relaxed relationship with New Delhi would facilitate U.S. cooperation
with moderate elements in the Indian leadership who favor nuclear restraint.&nbsp;
<p>A U.S. policy focused on nuclear restraint rather than nuclear rollback
should not only seek to minimize the number of warheads but also to keep
them under civilian control and to limit the frequency of missile tests.
Other key U.S. goals should be to get India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty and to formalize de facto Indian restrictions on the export
of nuclear technology.&nbsp;
<p>Moderate elements in New Delhi are sympathetic to many of these objectives
but need U.S. quid pro quos to make them politically attainable. For example,
the continuation of sanctions makes it impossible for the Indian government
to sign the test ban without appearing to surrender to foreign pressure.
Equally important, the sanctions have blocked $3 billion in multilateral
aid credits for power projects and other economic development priorities.&nbsp;
<p>Together with the removal of sanctions, the U.S. should greatly reduce
the blanket restrictions on the transfer of dual-use technology that were
imposed after the 1998 tests. These restrictions cover many items with
little relevance to nuclear weapons.&nbsp;
<p>The most important U.S. quid pro quo would be the relaxation of the
existing U.S. ban on the sale of civilian nuclear reactors badly needed
by
India to help meet its growing energy needs. Indians find it galling that
China is permitted to buy U.S. reactors, while India is not.&nbsp;
<p>The reason for this blatantly discriminatory policy lies in legalistic
hair-splitting in the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since
China had tested nuclear weapons in 1964, it was classified as a "nuclear
weapons state" under the treaty. As such, Beijing was eligible to sign
the NPT, along with the other powers then possessing nuclear weapons, the
United States, Russia, Britain and France.&nbsp;
<p>All other states were barred in perpetuity from the nuclear club and
asked to forswear nuclear weapons formally by signing the treaty. India
branded the NPT as discriminatory and refused to sign. Now it would like
to sign as a nuclear weapon state but the U.S. will not permit it.&nbsp;
<p>The NPT itself does not bar its signatories from providing nuclear technology
to non-signatories such as India, However, the U.S. Congress went beyond
the NPT with a law stipulating that non-signatories cannot receive U.S.
nuclear technology even if they accept International Atomic Energy Agency,
or IAEA, safeguards on its use, which India is willing to do. This legislation
even bars the U.S. from helping India to make its nuclear reactors safer.&nbsp;
<p>Significantly, Hans Blix, the respected former IAEA director who now
heads the U.N. arms inspection mission to Iraq, has urged that the ban
on civilian nuclear sales to both India and Pakistan be lifted if they
are willing to make two major concessions: signing the test ban and agreeing
to freeze their stockpiles of weapons-grade fissile material at present
levels.&nbsp;
<p>"There is nothing in the NPT that would stand in the way of such an
arrangement," Blix noted at a Stockholm seminar, and as matters stand,
"India and Pakistan are most unlikely to discard whatever nuclear weapons
capacity they possess. There is even a clear risk of a race between them
to increase fissile material stocks."&nbsp;
<p>The United States has been pushing India to join in a multilateral moratorium
on fissile material production but without offering clear incentives. Blix
has proposed a more realistic approach. U.S. policy should be based on
a tacit recognition that a multipolar Asian balance of power in which India
possesses a minimum nuclear deterrent will be more stable than one in which
China enjoys a nuclear monopoly.&nbsp;
