<p><b><tt><font color="#000000">By P K IYENGAR</font></tt></b>
<p><font color="#000000">AFTER a long period of indecision and ambivalence
regarding its nuclear preparedness, India detonated five nuclear devices
in May 1998. Consequently, it declared itself a nuclear weapons country.
However, it is unlikely that we will be accepted as a weapons country under
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), because there is no provision
for threshold states maturing to become nuclear powers.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">When Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visits
the US next month, the CTBT will certainly be one of the important issues
raised by the Americans. There may be political arguments both for and
against signing the CTBT, but if we have decided to follow a policy of
nuclear deterrence, which will require weaponisation, then, scientifically,
we have no option but to continue testing. It is the scientific case that
I wish to make here.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">If one goes by the numbers for the total nuclear
yield put out by the Department of Atomic Energy, which I see no reason
to dispute, the yield of the thermonuclear device detonated on May 11,
1998 was around 40 kilotons. This is a rather low yield. If the yield was
deliberately kept low to restrict damage to the nearby villages, then surely
it would have been more sensible to test the thermonuclear device separately,
and not along with the 15 kt fission device. Now, the thermonuclear device
itself consisted of two parts: the fission trigger and the fusion core.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The crucial question is not what the total yield
of the device was, but what was the ratio of fission energy to fusion energy?
Clearly, for a given total yield, the greater the fraction of the fusion
energy, the more efficient is your thermonuclear device. In my opinion,
that ratio musts have been around 1:1, and no one has so far, to my knowledge
either publicly or privately, disputed that number. Therefore, by my estimate,
the fusion yield could not have been more than 20 kt. Further, it seems
likely that a fission `spark-plug' was used at the centre of the fusion
core, in which case the actual fusion yield would have been even less.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Sticking to the larger number of a 20 kt fusion
yield, one can easily calculate that the amount of LiD fusion material
needed would be only around 400 grams or around 500 cc. This is a very
small size for the fusion core, and the actual core used must certainly
have been much larger. This suggests that the fusion core burnt only partially,
perhaps less than 10 per cent. This can easily be checked; if the burn
was only partial, there should have been a lot of tritium produced, which
should have been detected after the explosions.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In such a complex system as a two-stage thermonuclear
device, getting any burn at all is a credit to the abilities of the scientists
and engineers of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). However, a thermonuclear
device that only burns partially is certainly inefficient. Logically and
scientifically, the next step would be to improve the design of the device
to achieve greater efficiency. This is particularly important from the
point of view of a weaponisation programme.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The government has declared a policy of maintaining
a minimum nuclear deterrent. Nuclear deterrence means that we have a demonstrable
nuclear capability that deters a potential adversary from attacking us.
For us to have a nuclear deterrent we must weaponise. For this, we must
have fusion weapons, because these are smaller, lighter, and more efficient
than fission weapons. But for that deterrent to be viable, we must master
all aspects of thermonuclear weapons, and demonstrate that expertise not
just in one, but many thermonuclear designs, particularly those of greater
efficiency.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Whether that should include a neutron bomb or
not, is not of the essence. In a neutron bomb, one establishes a thermonuclear
burn by igniting only a part of the core, and making the burn propagate.
This is the crux of the matter in designing an efficient thermonuclear
device. One may not have a neutron bomb in one's arsenal, but it would
strengthen our abilities if we successfully tested one.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Some people argue that we have benchmarked our
computer simulations using the data from the Pokhran tests, and, therefore,
further weapons can be designed based on those computer simulations. We
should note that we have conducted only one thermonuclear test, and that
too of low yield. It is, as mentioned before, likely that this device burnt
only partially. Devices that are more efficient will have to be built.
In order to weaponise, we will need missile-mountable devices, which will
have a different geometry. They will also have to be of higher yield. Then
these will have to be made compact, and integrated with delivery as well
as command and control systems. Can our nuclear deterrent be credible if
we go through this long process of weaponisation without a single additional
test? The bottom line is that we just cannot hand over to the army, or
deter potential aggressors with, weapons based on computer simulations.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">It is unscientific to embark on a long programme
of weaponisation, and develop elaborate plans for maintaining a credible
nuclear deterrent, all based on just one, low yield, thermonuclear test.
When we do not do this for the Agni or Prithvi missiles, why would we want
to take this risk for nuclear weapons? I am sure that the BARC scientists
themselves, like their DRDO counterparts, would prefer to take a more conservative
approach and test further to refine their designs and their capabilities.
This is the scientific way. It would be wrong for the government to pressure
the scientists to put a premature end to nuclear tests, for political expediency.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In principle, India accepts nuclear disarmament,
and hopes its problems will be solved if all countries accept non-discriminatory,
global, nuclear disarmament. Yet, this is unlikely to happen, from what
we see around us as well as in the `N5' (five nuclear weapons) countries.
In spite of long and friendly discussions with the US, we haven't come
to any concrete decision relating to a new status under the CTBT. If we
are to maintain our independence in today's world, it is essential for
us to have a credible nuclear deterrent, and this requires us to continue
testing.&nbsp;</font>
