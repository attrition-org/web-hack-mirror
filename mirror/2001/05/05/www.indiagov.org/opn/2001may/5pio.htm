<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>V</font></font></b>ajpayee's
visit to Iran was overdue. The greatest threat to our national security
comes from Pakistan-abetted terrorism and Jihad fanned by fundamentalists
in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Jaswant Singh's visit to the US was also a
success. But what about our neighbours?&nbsp;
<p>First Nepal was taking anti-Indian postures and now it's Bangladesh.
We have an arc of hostility ranging for Myanmar (Chinese-dominated), through
Bangladesh, Nepal and on to Pakistan. The ISI has encircled India and the
Sino-Pakistani nexus presents a clear and present danger to our very nationhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Our policy towards our neighbours has been weak and too soft. What the
present Government needs is to formulate a clear-cut guideline. We dithered
during Kargil, with Nepal and now with Bangladesh. We cannot allow ourselves
to be a convenient target whenever it suits the political interests of
our neighbours. Neighbours must learn to respect us and any threat to our
national security should carry a heavy penalty.
<p>The US seems interested in improving relations with us and moving towards
some kind of strategic understanding. This may partly be because the Bush
team comprises Cold War warriors, for whom China has replaced the former
Soviet Union as the major threat. The second factor could be the fear of
Islamic fundamentalism coming from the Pakistan-Taliban nexus. The message
conveyed to the Indian Foreign Minister was that the US would no longer
equate India with Pakistan, and would deal with each country separately
on the merits of the issue. There was no pressure or insistence for a dialogue
with Pakistan, or for settlement of the Kashmir issue. CTBT is also no
longer a priority with the Bush Administration. Jaswant Singh's ability
to strike up personal rapport may again become a positive factor.
<p>However, the world's only Superpower has its own agenda and interests.
It would be interested in some quid-pro-quo with India. The Indian market
is no longer an attraction after the economic chaos brought about by the
stock market scam. It will take considerable time before investor confidence
can be restored. The infighting within the Sangh Parivar, and with scams
surfacing daily, it is hardly likely the US investor is going to pour any
money into this country. A best there will be sectoral investment, largely
in the IT Sector.
<p>On the political and security front, we present a dismal picture. Whether
it was Kargil, or the late skirmish with Bangladesh, we seem to be totally
inept at safeguarding national security. So what can we possibly provide
or contribute towards the containment of China, or for that matter towards
checking the Taliban.? As a country we cannot deliver on the economic,
political and the military front.
<p>The visit to Iran was vital from the security angle. Containment of
the Sunni axis of Pak/Taliban fundamentalists has to be a national priority.
Iran is as much a victim as it is a Shiaite state, and the Taliban is as
hostile to Iran as it is to us. Iran has had to absorb a large number of
refugees from Afghanistan. There is the additional dimension of the spread
of fundamentalism to the Central Asian States, which are also a common
concern of Iran and India.
<p>During the latter half of 1996, the then Iranian Foreign Minister literally
pleaded with our Minister for External Affairs for some kind of an alliance
between India, Russia and Iran to check the rise of the Taliban. At that
time the Taliban had not yet reached Kabul. Unfortunately, our man's obsessive
love for Pakistan led to total inaction on this issue despite Iranian entreaties.
The Buddha statues may have been standing today had India taken firm action
and heeded Iranian advice. The world has lost a great cultural heritage
because of this monumental blunder.
<p>Sheer anti-Talibanism will not be sufficient to bind India and Iran
together. There has to be greater interaction and intensification of economic
relations. The gas pipeline is a suitable project but will have to be offshores.
Pakistan cannot be trusted, as it will only use revenues from India to
boost terrorism.
<p>We have to formulate a firm policy towards our neighbours. They cannot
be allowed to heap abuse or harm Indian national interest while we continue
to give one concession after the other as has been the case with Nepal.
Bangladesh is using us a pawn for their own domestic elections and we seem
to be standing by as hapless spectators. We should be generous with smaller
neighbours (Pakistan excluded) but must be firm where our national interest
or security is concerned. Essentially it has to be a carrot and stick approach.
<p>As usual we continue to bungle in Kashmir. A futile unilateral ceasefire
which has misfired as was predicted, and now a vain hope that a new interlocutor
may pull a rabbit out of the hat. The Hurriyat should have been allowed
to go to Pakistan, they would have achieved nothing. Pakistan has a direct
line and daily contact with certain Hurriyat leaders, and will not allow
a meaning dialogue with India unless it suits its interests. The ceasefire
will end in May, the dialogue will not get started, and this government
will once again be back to square minus one.
<p>The real weakness now use with the present Government. Its image is
tarnished; it is under siege from within its ranks (Sangh Parivar), its
NDA allies, and a divided Opposition. Only one thing the present Government
has in its favour is the Opposition, which keeps shooting itself in the
foot and mouth and all over the place. There cannot be any serious dialogue
with the Kashmiris, of all hues, or even the United States until this Government
can get its act together. Nobody is going talk to a Government, which appears
to be weak.
<p>Unfortunately the PMO has also been attacked rather viciously which
has weakened the authority of the PM. He is the cementing factor for the
NDA. But he cannot, and must not allow a partner, like the TDP to extract
whatever concessions they like. That will further damage his standing.
The Prime Minister has to regain his credibility if his Government is to
country otherwise there will be mid-term elections.
<p>The issue of corruption will not go away. It has become a part and parcel
of our daily life with little or no chance of being eradicated. If it is
not financial corruption, it is nepotism. Nepotism another from of corruption
and has equally bad consequences for the country. One former Prime Minister
took nepotism to an extreme degree. This aspect also needs attention. While
we talk financial corruption one comes across a strange contradiction.
Unless there is irrefutable evidence, the so-called "smoking gun", it is
considered unfair to charge someone with corruption. What if the man is
corrupt, is known to take money, but there is no conclusive proof. Should
such a person be allowed to continue with his ill-gotten gains? This is
where the media, and the public can play a constructive role. All such
persons must be exposed by fair means or foul. Till such time there is
genuine fear of taking bribes, there will be no respite. The crime must
get a befitting punishment, legally or through media exposure.
<p>National security does not mean only military or internal security.
Economic, environmental food security are all a pat of national security.
Corruption hits at the very fundamentals of all factors which constitute
national security.</td>
