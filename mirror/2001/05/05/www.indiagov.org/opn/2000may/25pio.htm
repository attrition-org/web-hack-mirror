<br><b>Sushil Kumar - <i>The Pioneer</i></b>
<p>India's nuclear strategy has been a policy of universal peace from the
very beginning.
<br>It has persistently denounced the use of nuclear weapons ever since
the holocaust at
<br>Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. However, these weapons have
dominated
<br>India s strategic planning and perceptions, which take into account
the possibility of
<br>a nuclear misadventure by its adversaries. Quite a few nations have
been expanding
<br>their nuclear arsenals under false pretexts or against dictates of
reason. Quite
<br>contrary to this, India, keeping in view the interests of humanity
at large, was in the
<br>forefront for the test ban negotiations right from the 1950s. Jawaharlal
Nehru had
<br>asked for assurance that the nuclear limitation treaties would be non-discriminatory
<br>and for the common good of the world populace.
<p>India's sincerity to the proclamation is established by the fact that
the very first
<br>international conference on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy held
in Geneva in
<br>1955 was presided over by none other than Homi Jehangir Bhaba, an eminent
Indian
<br>physicist and visionary. Dr Bhabha had enunciated the economic benefits
of using
<br>plutonium explosives in place of conventional ones for engineering
projects, etc.
<p>Taking a cue from this, the Americans and Russians commenced gainfully
their
<br>projects for the peaceful use of nuclear explosions. However, the Indian
leadership
<br>decided to stagger this endeavour lest others should see a hidden agenda
or design.
<br>The Indian intelligentsia has not been able to free itself from what
others may think or
<br>say and some of them even see an agenda in the straight forward efforts
of the
<br>Government to assert the country s autonomy.
<p>However much India's democratic values allow for their anxieties, it
is sad. As a
<br>people, we need to understand that the mighty in world history have
always been a
<br>more exalted figure than the weaklings. Both the world wars had erupted
because of
<br>the power struggle in the West and the developing countries had to
bear its brunt
<br>alongside the industrially and technologically advanced countries.
Since then the
<br>Western countries have been expanding their arsenals with more and
more deadly
<br>weaponry in the race for a superpower status.
<p>After the First World War there was an awakening among the Asians and
they too
<br>took to industrial developments. There was envy amongst the White races
and it
<br>would not be wrong to construe the Second World War as one goaded by
racial bias in its content. It is doubtful if the Americans could have
chosen to use the atomic
<br>bombs on the cities of Germany even if the Germans had not ended the
war in May
<br>1945. The technological progress and material expansions of the Japanese
had
<br>troubled the Western powers for too long and, in the atomic bombings
of Hiroshima
<br>and Nagasaki, the whole Western world, as it were, joined hands to
ensure the
<br>humbling of Japan.
<p>It is a different matter that now it has been proved beyond doubt that
the fire bombs
<br>and atomic bombs could not end the Second World War and finally the
Americans
<br>had to hurriedly accept the conditions set forth by the Japanese. The
war ended on
<br>the call of the Japanese emperor, weeks after the atom bombs had been
tested on
<br>innocent civilian populace. The horrendous impact of American atomic
bombs on
<br>Japanese human beings did not deter the British, the French and the
Russians in their
<br>resolve to have the atomic weapons.
<p>When China embarked upon the bomb project years after the end of the
Second World War, it was malafidely termed as the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and the
<br>Americans were very keen to bomb the Chinese nuclear sites in 1963
provided the
<br>Soviets cooperated with them. But the Soviets (Russians) have as many
Asians as
<br>European-origin people amongst them; they rightly did not agree. This
also shows
<br>the kind of containment the Western powers wanted in the proliferation
of nuclear
<br>weapons. American bomb in 1945, Russian bomb in 1949, British bomb
in 1952, and uptil the French bomb in 1960 there was no talk about stemming
the tide of nuclear proliferation.
<p>On the other hand, there were myriad efforts amongst the Western countries
to gain
<br>nuclear superiority and train others covertly to gain nuclear allies
so that nuclear
<br>battlefields be away from their homelands. India could have converted
the know-how and ability to use the atoms for peace in to the one for warring;
yet it chose not to enter the mad hawk-race because it believed that atomic
weapons are no weapons of war; these are the instruments of wrecking havoc
upon the sentient life on the globe.
<p>It was the Chinese aggression of 1962 that shattered India s faith in
the self denials
<br>and goaded it to produce weapon-grade plutonium; later it was the projected
threat
<br>of American Fifth Fleet in the Bay of Bengal in 1971 that forced India
to tell the world in 1974 that it knew well how to balance the imbalance
in the nuclear order.
<p>The nuclear explosion of India was for peaceful purposes and the test
was conducted underground and not in atmosphere unlike others. The unique
features of India's nuclear programme have been its totally indigenous
research and development and civilian-nuclear-technology and a non-compromise
on nuclear autonomy that may keep our option open. Between 1974 and 98
the P-5 managed to throttle India's nuclear programme.
<p>But there started, at the instigation of extra-subcontinental powers,
trouble in
<br>Kashmir, which witnessed an armed conflict at Kargil just a year ago.
It was a long
<br>war that resulted in hundreds of Indian casualties. However, even before
the lessons
<br>of Kargil could sink in with the side that perpetrated it, there was
a military coup in
<br>Pakistan. Democracy has, for all practical purposes, been shown the
door.
<p>In such an environment it is unfair of the Western powers to cry foul
about India s
<br>nuclear stance. Strategically, it needed the nuclear tests and it is
within India s
<br>sovereign right to do so. The threat perception is not from Pakistan
alone; the
<br>Chinese too have to be factored in. True, India is committed to the
banishment of
<br>nuclear weapons from the world and would willingly subscribe to the
international
<br>agreements like in the case of biological and chemical weapons, which
have been
<br>outlawed by international treaties. But, it is against the legitimisation
of nuclear
<br>weapons in the hands of a selective few and America should see reason
in our
<br>response so far.
<p>India is in favour of total nuclear disarmament. The United States seems
partially
<br>reconciled to a peaceful nuclear India and its President Bill Clinton
has
<br>comprehended the threats that engulf the nation. But, ultimately, it
is India which has
<br>to shed its inhibitions and assert: That it has the right to choose
its friends and
<br>identify its traditional foes on the basis of past experience. The
psychology of
<br>philosophical calculations, keeping in mind who could finally come
to our rescue and
<br>who would at the eleventh hour back out in the future, has to be given
up for
<br>pragmatism.
<p>A farsighted foreign policy based upon idealism invariably turns out
to be
<br>shortsighted in the technologically fast changing world and a shrinking
globe. India
<br>has no nuclear weapons even now but has the nuclear weapon know-how.
None
<br>should, therefore, grudge it if it is forced to turn its extended hand
for a shake into a
<br>fist for India s security and integrity. India s nuclear strategy shall
continue to be
<br>focussed on sub-continental self-defence and not for intra-war feuds.
