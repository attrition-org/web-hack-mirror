<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>&quot;What
do you think of Mahatma Gandhi?&quot;</P>

<P>'What do I think of Mahatma Gandhi?' said the poet-philosopher, emphatically:
'why, I think very highly of Gandhi. He is a great man, a great soul. He,
today, wields tremendous power over the teeming millions of India.'</P>

<P>'What is really the secret of his success?' </P>

<P>The secret of Gandhiji's success lies in his dynamic spiritual strength
and incessant self-sacrifice. Many public men make sacrifices for selfish
reasons. It is a sort of investment that yields handsome dividends. Gandhi
is altogether different. He is unique in his nobility. His very life is
another name for sacrifice. He is sacrifice itself. He covets no power,
no position, no wealth, no name and no fame. Offer him the throne of all
India, he will refuse to sit on it, but will sell the jewels and distribute
the money among the needy. Give him all the money America possesses, and
he will certainly refuse to accept it, unless to be given away for a worthy
cause for the uplift of humanity. His soul is perpetually anxious to give,
and he expects absolutely nothing in return - not even thanks. This is
no exaggeration, for I know him well: he came to our school at Bolpur and
lived with us for some time. His power of sacrifice becomes all the more
irresistible because it is wedded to his paramount fearlessness. Emperors
and Maharajas, guns and bayonets, imprisonments and tortures, insults and
injuries, even death itself, can never daunt the spirit of Gandhi. His
is a liberated soul. If anyone strangles me, I shall be crying for help;
but if Gandhi were strangled, I am sure he would not cry. He may laugh
at his strangler; and if he has to die, he will die smiling. His simplicity
of life is childlike, his adherence to truth is unflinching; his love for
mankind is positive and aggressive. He has what is known as the Christ
spirit. The longer I know him, the better I like him. It is needless -
for me to say that this great man is destined to play a prominent part
in moulding the future of the world.'</P>

<P>'Such a great man deserves to be better known in the world. Why don't
you make him known: you are a world figure?' I asked.</P>

<P>'How can I make him known ? I am nothing compared to his illumined soul.
And no truly great man has to be made great. They are great in their own
glory, and when the world is ready they become famous by dint of their
own greatness. When the time comes Gandhi will be known, for the world
needs him and his message of love, liberty and brotherhood. The soul of
the East has found a worthy symbol in Gandhi; for he is most eloquently
proving that man is essentially a spiritual being, that he flourishes best
in the realm of the moral and the spiritual, and most positively perishes,
both body and soul, in the atmosphere of hatred and gunpowder smoke.'</P>
