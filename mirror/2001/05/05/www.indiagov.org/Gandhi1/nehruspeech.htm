<P><A HREF="../Gandhi/gallery/photo14.htm"><IMG SRC="images/nehru-gandhi.gif" ALT="gandhi-nehru" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=154 WIDTH=212 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Friends
and Comrades, the light has gone out of our lives and there is darkness
everywhere. I do not know what to tell you and how to say it. Our beloved
leader, Bapu as we call him, the Father of the Nation, is no more. Perhaps
I am wrong to say that. Nevertheless, we will not see him again as we have
seen him for these many years. We will not run to him for advice and seek
solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not to me only but to millions
and millions of this country. And it is a little more difficult to soften
the blow by any other advice that I or anyone else can give you.</P>

<P>The light has gone out, I said, and yet I was wrong. For the light that
shone in our country was no ordinary light. The light that has illumined
this country for these many many years will illumine this country for many
more years, and a thousand years later that light will still be seen in
this country and the world will see it and it will give solace to innumerable
hearts. For that light represented something more than the immediate present;
it represented the living, the eternal truths, reminding us of the right
path, drawing us from error, taking this ancient country to freedom.</P>

<P>All this has happened when there was so much more for him to do. We
could never think that he was unnecessary or that he had done his task.
But now, particularly, when we are faced with so many difficulties, his
not being with us is a blow most terrible to bear.</P>

<P>A madman has put an end to his life, for I can only call him mad who
did it and yet there has been enough poison spread in this country during
the past years and months, and this poison has had an effect on people's
minds. We must face this poison, we must root out this poison, and we must
face all the perils that encompass us, and face them not madly or badly,
but rather in a way that our beloved teacher taught us to face them. </P>

<P>The first thing to remember now is that none of us dare misbehave because
he is angry. We have to behave like strong and determined people, determined
to face all the perils that surround us, determined to carry out the mandate
that our great teacher has given us, remembering always that if, as I believe,
his spirit looks upon us and sees us, nothing would displease his soul
so much as to see that we have indulged in any small behaviour or any violence.</P>

<P>So we must not do that. But that does not mean that we should be weak,
but rather that we should, in strength and in unity, face all the troubles
that are in front of us. We must hold together, and all our petty troubles
and difficulties and conflicts must be ended in the face of its great disaster.
A great disaster is a symbol to us to remember all the big things of life
and forget the small things of which we have thought too much. In his death
he has reminded us of the big things of life, the living truth, and if
we remember that, then it will be well with India.......</P>
