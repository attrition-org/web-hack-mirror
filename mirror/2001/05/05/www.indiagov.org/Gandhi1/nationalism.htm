<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>There
can be no question that the British Indians in South Africa are hemmed
in on all sides by restrictions more or less severe according to the Colonies
in which they are imposed, and that they are also very much misunderstood.
By this time, those of our readers who have followed these columns at all
attentively, would have noticed that there is ample proof for the two statements
we have just made. The purpose of this article is to draw some lessons
from these adverse circumstances. We are told &quot;Sweet are the uses
of adversity&quot;, which should be &quot;the instructor of the wise&quot;.
Let us see, then, whether we have learnt any lesson from adversity.</P>

<P>There are in India sharp divisions between the different races inhabiting
it; for instance, the Tamils, the 'Calcutta men', aas the inhabitants of
the upper provinces are called here, the Punjabis, the Gujaratis, etc.
There are also the Mahomedans, the Hindus, the Parsis, and others according
to religions. Then among the Hindus there are the <I>Brahmans</I>, the
<I>Kshatriyas</I>, the <I>Baniyas</I>, and others. Now, to our mind, if
we have brought from India these divisions and differences as very valuable
cargo to be treasured up all this distance, then there is no doubt that
it would clog us at every step, and hinder our progress. South Africa ought
to be to the British Indians a great Puri where all divisions are abolished
and levelled up. We are not, and ought not to be, Tamils or Calcutta men,
Mahomedans or Hindus, Brahmans or Baniyas, but simply and solely British
Indians, and as such we must sink or swim together. That the interests
of all the divisions are absolutely identical cannot be gained. That being
so, it is plain enought that our duty lies in doing away with any such
prejudices. That is preliminary step, and an indispensable one. We are
quite aware that our people have made a very great advance in that direction,
but in drawing general lessons from our difficulties, the statement would
be incomplete without a warning.</P>

<P>It is also incumbent on every Indian not merely to be satisfied with
having made sufficient to feed and clothe himself and his family; he must
be prepared to put his hands deep into his pocket for the public weal,
and here again we know that the community throughout South Africa has not
altogether failed in its duty, but we have no hesitation in saying that
it might have done much better.</P>

<P>Courage and patience are qualities which one needs very badly when one
is placed in difficult circumstances. We had, during the late war, a precious
opportunity of watching these two qualities at their best among Englishmen
in South Africa. The history of the siege of Ladysmith and its relief will
always be an example of invulnerable courage and inexhaustible patience.
Many Indians who took part as stretcher-bearers will be able to recollect
the scenes that they were witnesses to at the fights of Colenso and Spion
Kop. In spite of fearful odds and bad reverses, there was no yielding.
When at one time, even General Buller was inclined to think that relief
was impossible, the world knows that there flashed across the wire a message
from the hero of Candahar, that as long as General Buller had one man left
with him, he was not to give in. The great result we all know. Ours is
not a struggle so difficult or so heroic to contend against, but it teaches
a lesson in courage and patience which we ought to learn. If no sum of
money, no quantity of blood and no amount of time were considered too great
for the honour of the British Empire to relieve what were, after all, a
handful of the besieged in Ladysmith, shall we not think similarly when
we are engaged in a struggle for our liberties, and come to the conclusions
that we must have courage and patience enough to tide over passing misfortunes?
We should not forget that &quot;calamity is man's true touchstone&quot;
and that &quot;none can cure their harms by bewailing them&quot;.</P>

<P>But we require something more also. We are apt as a nation, and the
Missionaries have brought it up against us as a charge, to look at things
material with philosophical indifference, and make little of everyday comforts
of life. Now, that is an attitude for which we have unbounded admiration;
but it would be very much misplaced in South Africa. Such an attitude would
be a credit to those who do not know that there are many Indians in South
Africa who have migrated with any other desire than that of bettering their
material position. To such, then, it would be more philosophical to fall
in with the natural order of things, and to be prepared to spend in proportion
to their earnings. The charge, then, against the Indians that they live
on nothing would be dispelled. At the same time, nothing can be further
from our thoughts than to suggest that we, as a community, should give
ourselves up to pleasure. What we do wish to emphasise is the fact that
we ought, as far as may be, to &quot;do in Rome as the Romans do&quot;,
still retaining the attitude of mental indifference. If we can have such
comforts, well and good; and if we cannot, well and good, also.</P>

<P>But, above all else, what is most needed in a community which considers
itself to be ill-treated at the hands of others is the virtue of love and
charity. It is well known that, after all, men, being creatures of circumstances,
would do things which are unjustifiable quite unconsciously, owing to the
control exercised over them by the circumstances in which they are placed.
Is it not, then, necessary for us to be charitable in our judgements? We,
as a people, are devoted to religious speculations, and to doctrines of
non-resistance and of returning good for evil. We believe firmly in the
fact of even our thought colouring the actions of those of whom we may
think. We see such instances often in daily life. A great crime committed
by a man has been known to change his face in such a way as to stamp the
crime on it. Similarly, a great good act done by a man has produced the
opposed effect on his features, and he has been known, as the case may
be, either to attract or to repulse from, himself people by his very act.
We then hold it to be our paramount duty not to think evil of those who
we may consider are dealing unjustly by us. There is hardly any virtue
in the ability to do a good turn to those that have done similarly by us.
That even the criminals do. But it would be some credit if a good turn
could be done to an opponent. If this very simple thing be always borne
in mind, we do think that success will come to us far more quickly than
we are likely to imagine. We hope, as time goes by, to develop more fully
each one of the points cursorily touched upon in this article. At present,
it is enought for us to ask our country men to ponder over what we have
said, and to be always on the alert otherwise, storm-tossed as we are,
a surging wave may all of a sudden come upon us and engulf us, when any
action we may wish to take will be too late. </P>
