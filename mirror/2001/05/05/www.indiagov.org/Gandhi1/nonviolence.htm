<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>Had
Lala Lajpat Rai first ascertained what I had actually said on <I><A HREF="../Gandhi/ahimsa.htm">ahimsa</A></I>,
his remarks in the <I>Modern Review</I> for last July would not have seen
the light of day. Lalaji rightly questioned whether I actually made the
statements imputed to me. He says that if I did not, I should have contradicted
them. In the first place, I have not yet seen the papers which have reported
the remarks in question or those wherein my remarks were criticised. Secondly,
I must confess that I would not undertake to correct all the errors that
creep into reports that appear in the public press about my speeches. Lalalji's
article has been much quoted in the Gujarati newspapers and magazines;
and it is perhaps as well for me to explain my position. With due deference
to Lalaji, I must join issue with him when he says that the elevation of
the doctrine of <I>ahimsa </I>to the highest position contributed to the
downfall of India. There seems to be no historical warrant for the belief
that an exaggerated practice of <I>ahimsa </I>synchronised with our becoming
bereft of many virtues. During the past fifteen hundred years, we have
as a nation given ample proof of physical courage, but we have been torn
by internal dissensions and have been dominated by love of self instead
of love of country. We have, that is to say, been swayed by the spirit
of irreligion rather than of religon.</P>

<P>I do not know how far the charge of unmanliness can be made good against
the Jains. I hold no brief for them. By birth I am a <I>Vaishnavite</I>,
and was taught <I>ahimsa </I>in my childhood. I have derived much religious
benefit from Jain religious works, as I have from scriptures of the other
great faiths of the world. I owe much to the living company of the deceased
philosopher Raja Chand Kavi who was a Jain by birth. Thus though my views
on <I>ahimsa </I>are a result of my study of most of the faiths of the
world, they are now no longer dependent upon the authority of these works.
They are a part of my life and if I suddenly discovered that the religious
books read by me bore a different interpretation from the one I had learnt
to give them, I should still hold to the view of <I>ahimsa </I>as I am
about to set forth here.</P>

<P>Our <I>shastras </I>seem to teach that a man who really practises <I>ahimsa
</I>in its fullness has the world at this feet, he so affects his surroundings
that even the snakes and other venomous reptiles do him no harm. This is
said to have been the experience of St. Francis of Assisi.</P>

<P>In its negative form, it means not injuring any living being, whether
by body or mind. I may not therefore hurt the person of any wrong-doer,
or bear any ill will to him and so cause him mental suffering. This statement
does not cover suffering caused to the wrong-doer by natural acts of mine
which do not proceed from ill-will. It, therefore, does not prevent me
from withdrawing from his presence a child whom he, we shall imagine, is
about to strike. Indeed the proper practice of ahimsa required me to withdraw
the intended victim from the wrong-doer, if I am in any way whatsoever
the guardian of such a chid. It was therefore most proper for the passive
resisters of South Africa then. They bore no ill will to it. They showed
this by helping the Government whenever it needed their help. Their resistance
consisted of disobedience of the orders of the Government, even to the
extent of suffering death at their hands. <I>Ahimsa </I>requires deliberate
self-suffering, not a deliberate injuring of the supposed wrong-doer.</P>

<P>In is positive form, <I>ahimsa </I>means the largest love, the greatest
charity. If I am a follower of <I>ahimsa</I>, I must love my enemy. I must
apply the same rule to the wrong-doer who is my enemy or a stranger to
me, as I would to my wrong-doing father or son. This active ahimsa necessarily
includes truth and fearlessness. A man cannot deceive the loved ones; he
does not fear or frighten him or her. 'Gift of life' is the greatest of
all gifts; A man who gives it in reality disarms all hostility. He has
paved the way for an honourable understanding. And none who is himself
subject to fear can bestow that gift. He must therefore be himself fearless.
A man cannot then practice ahimsa and be a coward at the same time, The
practice of <I>ahimsa </I>calls forth the greatest courage. It is the most
soldierly of a soldier's virtues. General Gordon has been represented in
a famous statue as bearing only a stick. This takes us far on the road
to <I>ahimsa</I>. But a soldier who needs the protection of even a stick
is to that extent so much the less a soldier. He is the true soldier who
knows how to die and stand his ground in the midst of a hail of bullets.
Such a one was Ambarish who stood his ground without lifting a finger,
though Durvasa did his worst. The Moors, who on being powdered by the French
gunners rushed into the guns' mouth with 'Allah' on their lips, showed
much the same type of courage. Only theirs was the courage of desperation.
Ambarish's was due to love. Yet the Moorish valour, readiness to die, conquered
the gunners. They frantically waved their hats, ceased firing and greeted
their erstwhile enemies as comrades. And so the South African passive resisters
in their thousands were ready to die rather than sell their honour for
a little personal ease. This was <I>ahimsa </I>in its active form. It never
barters away honour, A helpless girl in the hands of a follower of <I>ahimsa
</I>finds better and surer protection than in the hands of one who is prepared
to defend her only to the point to which his weapons would cary him. The
tyrant, in the first instance, will have to walk to his victim over the
dead body of her defender, in the second he has but to overpower the defender,
for it is assumed that the canon of propriety in the second instance will
be satisfied when the defender has faught to the extent of his physical
valour. In the first instance, as the defender has matched his very soul
against the mere body of the tyrant, the odds are that the soul in the
latter will be awakened, and the girl will stand an infinitely greater
chance of her honour being protected than in any other conceivable circumstance
- barring, of course, that of her own personal courage.</P>

<P>If we are unmanly today, we are so not because we do not know how to
strike, but because we fear to die. He is no follower of Mahavira, the
apostle of Jainism, or of Buddha or of the Vedas, who being afraid to die
takes flight before any danger, real or imaginary, all the while wishing
that somebody else would remove the danger by destroying the person causing
it. He is no follower of <I>ahimsa </I>( I agree with Lalaji) who does
not care a straw if he kills a man by inches by deceiving him in trade,
or who will protect by force of arms a few cows and make away with the
butcher, or who in order to do a supposed good to his country does not
mind killing off a few officials. All these are actuated by hatred, cowardice
and fear. Here love of the cow or the country is a vague thing intended
to satisfy one's vanity or soothe a stinging conscience.</P>

<P><I>Ahimsa</I>, truly understood, is in my humble opinion a panacea for
all evils, mundane and extra-mundane. We can never overdo it. Just at present,
we are not doing it at all. <I>Ahimsa </I>does not displace the practice
of other virtues, but renders their practice imperatively necessary before
it can be practised even in its rudiments. Lalaji need not fear the <I>ahimsa
</I>of his father's faith. Mahavira and Buddha were soldiers, and so was
Tolstoy. Only they saw deeper and truer in their profession, and found
sharers with these teachers and this land of ours will once more be the
abode of gods.</P>
