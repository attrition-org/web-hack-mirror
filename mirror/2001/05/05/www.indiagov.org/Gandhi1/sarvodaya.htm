<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>People
in the West generally hold that it is man's duty to promote the happiness
- prosperity, that is - of the greatest number. Happiness is taken to mean
material happiness exclusively, that is, economic prosperity. If, in the
pursuit of this happiness, moral laws are violated, it does not matter
much. Again, as the object is the happiness of the greatest number, people
in the West do not believe it to be wrong if it is secured at the cost
of the minority. The consequences of this attitude are in evidence in all
western countries.</P>

<P>The exclusive quest for the physical and material happiness of the majority
has no sanction in divine law. In fact, some thoughtful persons in the
West have pointed out that it is contrary to divine law to pursue happiness
in violation of moral principles. The late John Ruskin was foremost among
these. He was an Englishman of great learning. He has written numerous
books on art and crafts. He has also written a great deal on ethical questions.
One of these books, a small one Ruskin himself believed to be his best.
It is read widely wherever English is spoken. In the book, he has effectively
countered these arguments and shown that the well-being of the people at
large consists in conforming to the moral law.</P>

<P>We in India are much given now-a-days to imitation of the West. We do
grant that it is necessary to imitate the West in certain respects. At
the same time there is no doubt that many western ideas are wrong. It will
be admitted on all hands that what is bad must be eschewed. The condition
of Indians in South Africa is pitiable. We go out to distant lands to make
money. We are so taken up with this that we become oblivious of morality
and of God. We become engrossed in the pursuit of self-interest. In the
sequel, we find that going abroad does us more harm than good, or does
not profit us as much as it ought to. All religions pre-suppose the moral
law, but even if we disregard religion as such, its observance is necessary
on grounds of common-sense also. Our happiness consists in observing it.
This is what John Ruskin has established. He has opened the eyes of the
Western people to this, and today, we see a large number of Europeans modelling
their conduct on his teaching. In order that Indians may profit by his
ideas, we have decided to present extracts from his book, in a manner intelligible
to Indians who do not know English.</P>

<P>Socrates gave us some idea of man's duty. He practised his precepts.
It can be argued that Ruskin's ideas are an elaboration of Socrates's.
Ruskin has described vividly how one who wants to live by Socrates's ideas
should acquit himself in the different vocations. The summary of his work
which we offer here is not realy a translation. If we translated it, the
common reader might be unable to follow some of Biblical allusions, etc.
We present therefore only the substance of Ruskin's work. We do not even
explain what the title of the book means, for it can be understood only
by a person who has read the Bible in English. But since the object which
the book works towards is the welfare of all that is, the advancement of
all and not merely of the greatest number we have entitled these articles
&quot;<I>Sarvodaya</I>&quot;.</P>
