<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>We
have been waiting for the Person, such a personality as we see in Mahatma
Gandhi. It is only possible in the East for such a man to become a great
personality. He has neither physical nor material power, but through his
great influence people who have been in subjection to all kinds of tyrannical
power have stood up; and he is the strongest spiritual power in this world
today. Not because of his political prudence, but for his spiritual influence
the people believe in him, and they are ready to die for their faith. They
are ready to suffer. It is a miracle that these people, downtrodden for
centuries, are coming out; and without doing any injury to others they
suffer, and through suffering, conquer.</P>

<P>And our women, - only the other day they were secluded in their own
inner apartments - they, too, have come out to follow this man, this leader.
Not an association, not an organisation, not a politician, but a Man! And
his message goes deep into our veins. He attacks the enemies that are within
us. Not like the political machinery which you have that attacks from the
outside and that tries to work through the external. But he attacks the
inner man.</P>
