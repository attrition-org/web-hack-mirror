<P><IMG SRC="images/bapu_s.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=61 ALIGN=LEFT>So
many strange things have been said about my views on national education,
it would perhaps not be out of place to formulate them before the public.</P>

<P>In my opinion the existing system of education is defective, apart from
its association with an utterly unjust Government, in three most important
matters:</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is based upon foreign culture
to the almost entire exclusion of indigenous culture.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>It ignores the culture of the
heart and the hand, confines itself simply to the head.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=-1>Real education is impossible
through a foreign medium.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P>Let us examine the three defects. Almost from the commencement, the
text-books deal, not with things the boys and the girls have always to
deal with in their homes, but things to which they are perfect strangers.
It is not through the text-books, that a lad learns what is right and what
is wrong in the home life. He is never taught to have any pride in his
surroundings. The higher he goes, the farther he is removed from his home,
so that at the end of his education he becomes estranged from his surroundings.
He feels no poetry about the home life. The village scenes are all a sealed
book to him. His own civilisation is presented to him as imbecile, barbarous,
superstitious and useless for all practical purposes. His education is
calculated to wean him from his traditional culture. And if the mass of
educated youths are not entirely denationalised, it is because the ancient
culture is too deeply embedded in them to be altogether uprooted even by
an education adverse to its growth. If I had my way, I would certainly
destroy the majority of the present text-books and cause to be written
text-books which have a bearing on and correspondence with the home life,
so that a boy as he learns may react upon his immediate surroundings.</P>

<P>Secondly, whatever may be true of other countries, in India at any rate
where more than eighty per cent of the population is agricultural and another
ten per cent industrial, it is a crime to make education merely literary
and to unfit boys and girls for manual work in after-life. Indeed I hold
that as the larger part of our time is devoted to labour for earning our
bread, our children must from their infancy be taught the dignity of such
labour. Our children should not be so taught as to despise labour. There
is no reason, why a peasant's son after having gone to a school should
become useless as he does become an agricultural labourer. It is a sad
thing that our schoolboys look upon manual labour with disfavour, if not
contempt. Moreover, in India, if we expect, as we must, every boy and girl
of school-going age to attend public schools, we have not the means to
finance education in accordance with the existing style, nor are millions
of parents able to pay the fees that are at present imposed. Education
to be universal must therefore be free. I fancy that even under an ideal
system of government, we shall not be able to devote two thousand million
rupees which we should require for funding education for all the children
of school-going age. It follows, therefore, that our children must be made
to pay in labour partly or wholly for all the education they receive. Such
universal labour to be profitable can only be (to my thinking) hand-spinning
an hand weaving. But for the purposes of my proposition, it is immaterial
whether we have spinning or any other form of labour, so long as it can
be turned to account. Only, it will be found upon examination, that on
a practical, profitable and extensive scale there is no occupation other
than the processes connected with cloth production which can be introduced
in our schools throughout India.</P>

<P>The introduction of manual training will serve a double purpose in a
poor country like ours. It will pay for the education of our children and
teach them an occupation on which they can fall back in after-life, they
choose, for earning a living. Such a system must make our children self-reliant.
Nothing will demoralise the nation so much as that we should learn to despise
labour.</P>

<P>One word only as to the education of the heart. I do not believe, that
this can be imparted through books. It can only be done through the living
touch of the teacher. And, who are the teachers in the primary and even
secondary schools? Are they men and women of faith and character? Have
they themselves received the training of the heart? Are they even expected
to take care of the permanent element in the boys and girls placed under
their charge? Is not the method of engaging teachers for lower schools
an effective bar against character? Do the teachers get even a living wage?
And we know, that the teachers of primary schools are not selected for
their patriotism. They only come who cannot find any other employment.</P>

<P>Finally, the medium of instruction. My views on this point are too well
known to need re-stating. The foreign medium has caused brain-fag, put
an undue strain upon the nerves of our children, made them crammers and
imitators, unfitted them for original work and thought, and disabled them
for filtrating their learning to the family or the masses. The foreign
medium has made our children practically foreigners in their own land.
It is the greatest tragedy of the existing system. The foreign medium has
prevented the growth of our vernaculars. If I had the power of a despot,
I would today stop the tuition of our boys and girls through a foreign
medium, and require all the teachers and professors on pals of dismissal
to introduce the change forthwith. I would not wait for the preparation
of text-books. They will follow the change. It is an evil that needs a
summary remedy.</P>

<P>My uncompromising opposition to the foreign medium has resulted in an
unwarranted charge being levelled against me of being hostile to foreign
culture or the learning of the English language. No reader of <I>Young
India</I> could have missed the statement often made by me in these pages,
that I regard English as the language of international commerce and diplomacy
and therefore consider its knowledge on the part of some of us as essential.
As it contains some of the richest treasures of thought and literature,
I would certainly encourage its careful study among those who have linguistic
talents and expect them to translate those treasures for the nation in
its vernaculars.</P>

<P>Nothing can be farther from my thought that we should become exclusive
or erect barriers. But I do respectfully contend, that an appreciation
of other cultures can fitly follow, never precede an appreciation and assimilation
of our own. It is my firm opinion, that no culture has treasures so rich
as ours has. We have not known it, we have been made even to deprecate
its study and depreciate its value. We have almost ceased to live it. An
academic grasp without practice behind it is like an embalmed corpse, perhaps
lovely to look at but nothing to inspire or ennoble. My religion forbids
me to belittle or disregard other cultures, as it insists under pain of
civil suicide upon imbibing and living my own.</P>
