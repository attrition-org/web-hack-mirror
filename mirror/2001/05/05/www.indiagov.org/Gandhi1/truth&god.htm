<P><IMG SRC="images/mahatmagandhi.gif" ALT="Gandhi" HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=84 ALIGN=LEFT>You
have asked me why I consider that God is Truth. In my early youth I was
taught to repeat what in Hindu scriptures are known as one thousand names
of God. But these one thousand names of God were by no means exhaustive.
We believe - and I think it is the truth - that God has as many names as
there are creatures, and, therefore, we also say that God is nameless and
since God has many forms we also consider Him formless, and since He speaks
to us through many tongues we consider Him to be speechless and so on.
And so when I came to study Islam I found that Islam too had many names
for God. I would say with those who say God is Love, God is Love. But deep
down in me I used to say that though God may be Love, God is Truth, above
all. If it is possible for the human tongue to give the fullest description
of God, I have come to the conclusion that for myself, God is Truth. But
two years ago I went a step further and said that Truth is God. You will
see the the fine distinction between the two statements, viz., that God
is Truth and Truth is God. And I came to that conclusion after a continuous
and relentless search after Truth which began nearly fifty years ago. I
then found that the nearest approach to Truth was through love. But I also
found that love has many meanings in the English language at least and
that human love in the sense of passion could become a degrading thing
also. I found too that love in the sense of <I><A HREF="../Gandhi/ahimsa.htm">ahimsa
</A></I>had only a limited number of votaries in the world. But I never
found a double meaning in connection with Truth and not even atheists had
demurred to the necessity or power of truth. But in their passion for discovering
truth the atheists have not hesitated to deny the very existence of God
- from their own point of view, rightly. And it was because of this reasoning
that I saw that rather than say that God is Truth I should say that Truth
is God. I recall the name of Charles Bradlaugh who delighted to call himself
an atheist, but knowing as I do something of him, I would never regard
him as an atheist. I would call him a God-fearing man, though I know that
he would reject the claim. His face would redden if I would say, &quot;Mr.
Bradlaugh, you are a truth-fearing man, and not a God-fearing man.&quot;
I automatically disarm his criticism by saying that Truth is God, as I
have disarmed the criticisms of many a young man. Add to this the great
difficulty that millions have taken the name of God and in His name committed
nameless atrocities. Not that scientists very often do not commit cruelties
in the name of truth. I know how in the name of truth and science inhuman
cruelties are perpetrated on animals when men perform vivisection. There
are thus a number of difficulties in the way, no matter how you describe
God. But the human mind is a limited thing, and you have to labour under
limitations when you think of being or entity who is beyond the power of
man to grasp. And then we have another thing in Hindu philosophy, viz.,
God alone is and nothing else exists. In fact the Sanskrit word for Truth
is a word which literally means that which exists - <I>Sat</I>. For these
and several other reasons that I can give you I have come to the conclusion
that the definition - Truth is God - gives me the greatest satisfaction.
And when you want to find Truth as God the only inevitable means is Love,
ie., non-violence, and since I belive that ultimately the means and end
are convertible terms, I should not hesitate to say that God is Love.</P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">What then is Truth?</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>A difficult question, but I have solved it for my self by saying that
it is what the voice within tells you. How then, you ask, do different
people think of different and contrary truths? Well, seeing that the human
mind works through innumerable media and that the evolution of the human
mind is not the same for all, it follows that what may be truth for one
may be untruth for another, and hence those who have made these experiments
have come to the conclusion that there are certain conditions to be observed
in making those experiments. Just as for conducting scientific experiments
there is an indispensable scientific course of instruction, in the same
way strict preliminary discipline is necessary to qualify a person to make
experiments in the spiritual realm. Everyone should, therefore, realise
his limitations before he speaks of his inner voice. Therefore we have
the belief based upon experience, that those who would make individual
search after truth as God, must go through several vows, as for instance,
the vow of truth, the vow of <I>brahmacharya </I>(purity), for you cannot
possibly divide your love for Truth and God with anything else - the vow
of non-violence, of poverty and non-possession. Unless you impose on yourselves
the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all. There are several
other conditions prescribed, but I must not take you through all of them.
Suffice it to say that those who have made these experiments know that
it is not proper for everyone to claim to hear the voice of conscience
and it is because we have at the present moment everybody claiming the
right of conscience without going through any discipline whatsoever that
there is so much untruth being delivered to a bewildered world. All that
I can in true humility present to you is that truth is not to be found
by anybody who has not got an abundant sense of humility. If you would
swim on the bosom of the ocean of Truth you must reduce yourself to a zero.
Further than this I cannot go along this fascinating path.</P>
