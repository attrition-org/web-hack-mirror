<td>San Francisco, May 4: New Delhi’s support of President George W. Bush’s
proposal to cut America’s nuclear arsenal and its studied silence on the
US’ plans to build its missile defences, has earned the praise of South
Asian analysts and members of the Indian-American community alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Almost all those interviewed by The Asian Age were unanimous in their
assessment that New Delhi’s reaction was a welcome “break from the past”
and a positive portent for future Indo-US relations as well.&nbsp;
<p>“It is a break from the past, and India appears to be examining these
issues in terms of Indian interests instead of global interests,” agreed
Prof. Stephen Cohen, director of the South Asia programme at the Washington
D.C.-based Brookings Institution. “Till now, India tended to respond to
such programmes with a knee-jerk reaction.”
<p>In a speech at the National Defence University in Washington on May
1, President Bush had announced his plan to create a National Missile Defence
shield to protect the United States from missile attack. The proposal drew
sharp protests from Russia and China with both countries expressing concern
that the plan would initiate a new arms race.
<p>Along with America’s European allies, New Delhi had welcomed Mr Bush’s
announcement and had applauded his expressed desire to make a “clean break
from the past” and, especially from the “adversarial legacy of the Cold
War.”
<p>“For a change, the Indian government has been way ahead of the whole
world on this vitally important issue that concerns the very survival of
humanity,” said a Congressional analyst who follows Indian sub-continental
affairs closely. “In a way, the Indian response reflects the values and
spiritual ethos of that ancient land.”
<p>Requesting anonymity, this analyst added: “What is stunning to me are
the run-of-the-mill, knee-jerk and hollow reactions from the spokesman
of the Congress Party and editorial writers of the elitist English-language
press in India... They appear to be caught up in a time warp and don’t
seem to realise that nuclear theology needs to be redefined and New Delhi
has to play a leading role along with the United States in this process.”
<p>A professor of Asian studies and government at the University of Texas,
Austin, Sumit Ganguly described New Delhi’s reaction as “extremely skilful.”
Agreeing with Mr Cohen that it avoided “the typical knee-jerk reaction
that anything the US does on nuclear weapons is bad,” Prof. Ganguly added
that from the standpoint of Indo-US relations, New Delhi’s measured endorsement
would have a very salutary effect on relations.&nbsp;
<p>“It is now up to the US to reciprocate the sensitivity displayed by
India,” he added. Prof. Ganguly cautioned that the only potential adverse
affect was “if the Chinese step up production of nuclear weapons as a consequence
of Mr Bush’s announcement, then the Indians would also have to do the same.”
<p>However, he added that this was “not such a bad thing” especially for
the Vajpayee government, which was in any case “keen to develop a robust
nuclear capability.” Mr Cohen said India was correct to adopt a “wait-and-see”
policy. “Its response seems to be parallel to that from the European allies,”
he said, adding that this was “a prudent response and not an endorsement
of a plan that hasn’t even been spelt out as yet.”&nbsp;
<p>“India is no longer being a global nanny and is for a change, viewing
issues in terms of its own security interests,” Mr Cohen said. All praise
for those handling foreign and defence policy in New Delhi, Prof. Ganguly
said, “They are very deft. This is a muted, calibrated reaction that focuses
on the US’ willingness to reduce its arsenal.”
<p>Reacting to concerns raised by Russia and China that the proposal could
lead to an arms race and destabilise Asia, Prof. Ganguly said, “India has
an independent foreign policy. While Russia is a declining power, India
has a contentious relationship with China. Why should we bother about them?”
<p>He said the Chinese had done lots of things that were not necessarily
in India’s interests, and India must now do what’s in its interests. “For
far too long India was far too solicitous.”
<br>Missouri-based chairman of the southern chapter of the Coalition of
Indian-American Physicians for George W. Bush, Dr Sampat Shivangi said
it was “a positive thing” for India to have some deterrent to China’s “expansionist
designs.”
<p>“Mr Bush’s proposal will give the Indians a kind of umbrella. This is
a positive step for all the countries around China, including Japan and
Korea,” Dr Shivangi said, adding, “China will think twice before flexing
its muscles.” Speaking about national security advisor Condoleezza Rice’s
telephone call to foreign minister Jaswant Singh prior to Mr Bush’s speech
on May 1, Dr Shivangi said, “It looks like they have developed a good rapport.&nbsp;
<p>Ms Rice is not a political person, but she’s the one who formulates
Mr Bush’s foreign policy. She realises that while Mr Bush remains hawkish
on China, the US needs to befriend the next biggest power in the region
— India.” Minnesota-based Republican, Mr Gopal Khanna said that now that
the Cold War was over, India needed to shift to a new global paradigm in
which it could play a very important role.
<p>“I find it very gratifying that India has taken a supportive stand.
I think it will lead to better relations between the two countries,” he
said. Mr Khanna was of the opinion that the biggest gain for India, which
would emerge from this skilful bureaucracy, would be “America’s goodwill.”
<p>“Any alliance is based on goodwill and trust and an understanding of
each other’s position New Delhi’s support sends a message that India is
serious about an alliance with the United States.” Dr Shivangi pointed
out that besides goodwill, India would also benefit by sharing technology
and the involvement of Indian programmers in developing a missile shield.
<p>Mr Khanna said there were many issues that both India and the US had
in common and mutual security interests in the region were inter-woven
— “the US wants to contain global terrorism and China’s hegemony in Asia,
this is also in India’s interest”. Los Angeles-based president-elect of
the National Federation of Indian-American Associations, Ms Anna Prasad
said she was “glad India and the US have begun to see eye to eye on certain
issues.”
<p>“Both India and the US have common interests, and maybe some common
enemies as well. I am glad the US is looking on India as a global leader
and is not nit-picking on minor irritants,” Ms Prasad said. Washington-based
president of the National Council of Asian Indian Associations, Mr Shreekanta
Nayak, however, was one of the few who disagreed with India’s support to
Mr Bush’s plan.
<p>“You cannot just take the example of a few rogue nations and come up
with a new concept on Star Wars technology,” Mr Nayak argued, adding, “Does
this mean the US is going to play big brother again? How can we just write
off the ABM treaty?” Agreeing that India and the US must have strong relations,
Mr Nayak said New Delhi must not offer “blindfolded” support.
<p>He, however, added that Moscow is not going to listen only to the US
but will also put forward its position. He said Russian President Vladimir
Putin had already come up with a cohesive programme with reference to missile
defence and that Russia had proposed a substantial reduction of nuclear
weapons to bring them down to 1,500 on both sides.&nbsp;
<p>It was reiterated during the meeting, which covered bilateral, regional
and international issues, that agreements between India and Russia must
be respected and any modification of these should be done through mutual
consultation and understanding.&nbsp;</td>
