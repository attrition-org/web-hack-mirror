<td>New Delhi, May 4: India and Croatia today signed a bilateral investment
promotion and protection agreement which is expected to impact a new momentum
to the Indo-Croatian economic relations.&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.the-hindu.com/images/02050001.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=1 height=171 width=250 align=RIGHT>
<p>The agreement was signed by the Finance Minister, Mr. Yashwant Sinha,
and the visiting Croatian Foreign Minister, Mr. Tonino Picula, at a function
here today.&nbsp;
<p>The agreement with Croatia is the 43rd such agreement signed by India.&nbsp;
<p>It shall come into force on the thirtieth day after both Governments
have notified each other the fulfilment of the Constitutional requirements
and shall remain in force for a period of 10 years and may thereafter continue
unless either Government gives one year's written notice of its intention
to terminate the agreement.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Ivanov's statements were contrary to expectations that Russia would
react adversely to India's embrace of Bush's missile-based nuclear doctrine.
Along with a press conference he had held about Bush's plan just before
leaving for India, his statements indicate Moscow has taken note that Bush
had stated Russia was not a strategic adversary of the US.&nbsp;
<p>Prior to his meeting with Singh, Ivanov had called on Prime Minister
Vajpayee and gave him a letter from President Vladimir Putin, which proposed
specific steps to improve bilateral co-operation. Russia has welcomed a
greater participation by India in its economic recovery and hopes for more
joint ventures. A summit level meeting was proposed for November in Moscow
and India confirmed that Vajpayee would be accepting the offer.&nbsp;
<p>On the question of a New Delhi-Moscow-Beijing axis, the two foreign
ministers said the idea harked back to cold war-era formations which were
no longer desirable. Ivanov said all three countries were working with
each other on a bilateral basis.&nbsp;</td>
