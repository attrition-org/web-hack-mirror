<td>New Delhi, May 4: India and Russia on Friday discussed threadbare the
international ramifications of United States President George Bush's new
security policy. Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, and India's external
affairs minister Jaswant Singh agreed during their talks today that the
two countries need to be in close consultation with each other as the US
proposals concerned global security.&nbsp;
<p>In his first public reaction today to the US proposal, made during a
joint press conference, the Indian minister said he was against the unilateral
abrogation of the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty. He reminded his guests
that India's welcome to the US plan was a qualified one. "Between mutually
agreed decisions and mutually assured destruction we prefer the former,"
he said.&nbsp;
<p>Ivanov made it clear he had no objections to India's optimism regarding
Washington's new nuclear plans. "Our approaches mostly coincide," he said.
He said he was looking forward to meeting the delegation of experts that
the US President has promised to send to explain the US plan in detail.
"But we will not just listen. We have something to say."&nbsp;
<p>Ivanov's statements were contrary to expectations that Russia would
react adversely to India's embrace of Bush's missile-based nuclear doctrine.
Along with a press conference he had held about Bush's plan just before
leaving for India, his statements indicate Moscow has taken note that Bush
had stated Russia was not a strategic adversary of the US.&nbsp;
<p>Prior to his meeting with Singh, Ivanov had called on Prime Minister
Vajpayee and gave him a letter from President Vladimir Putin, which proposed
specific steps to improve bilateral co-operation. Russia has welcomed a
greater participation by India in its economic recovery and hopes for more
joint ventures. A summit level meeting was proposed for November in Moscow
and India confirmed that Vajpayee would be accepting the offer.&nbsp;
<p>On the question of a New Delhi-Moscow-Beijing axis, the two foreign
ministers said the idea harked back to cold war-era formations which were
no longer desirable. Ivanov said all three countries were working with
each other on a bilateral basis.&nbsp;</td>
