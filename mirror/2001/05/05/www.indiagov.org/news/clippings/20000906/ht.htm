<h2>China constant supplier of N-products to Pak: Study
<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"></h2>
Wasnington, September 5: Despite China's persistent denial that it did
not encourage nuclear proliferation, a recent study by a US think-tank
has indicated that Beijing has been a constant supplier of a variety of
nuclear products and services to Pakistan, ranging from uranium enrichment
technology to research and power reactors.
<p>The study published by the Centre for NonProliferation Studies at the
Monterey Institute of International Studies has come up with fresh details
about how China helped Pakistan become a significant nuclear and missile
power in South Asia.
<p>US intelligence agencies said the study had reported, as early as 1983,
that Beijing had by then transferred a complete nuclear weapon design to
Islamabad, along with enough weapons-grade uranium for two nuclear weapons.
<p>In 1986, China concluded a comprehensive nuclear cooperation agreement
with Pakistan and in the same year, they began assisting Islamabad with
the enrichment of weapons-grade uranium. China also reportedly transferred
enough tritium gas to Pakistan for 10 nuclear weapons. In 1989, China allegedly
involved Pakistani scientists in a nuclear test at its Lopnur test site.
In 1994-95 5000 China sold ring magnets to a Q. Khan research lab at Kahuta
which were used in gas centrifuges to make weapons-grade enriched uranium.
The destination of the magnets, the research lab, is not subject to International
Atomic Energy safeguards and is believed to be involved with Pakistan's
nuclear weapons programme.
<p>China has also routinely supplied Pakistan heavy water (D20) which was
needed, both for safeguarding Kanupp facility as well as for operating
some reactors like the Khushab facility, to be used for producing plutonium
for nuclear weapons.
<p>Beijing also sold a special industrial furnace for the Khushab facility
in 1996 and Chinese scientists were reportedly in Pakistan to help install
the furnace, the study said, adding the furnace can be used to melt uranium
into the shape of a nuclear bomb core besides having civilian applications.
<p>In 1983, China supplied Pakistan the complete design of a nuclear weapon
- a 25 kiloton nuclear bomb, possibly a Chic-4. China reportedly reached
a deal with Pakistan to supply heavy water to the Kanupp facility but the
deal was delayed due to concerns that it might be diverted to the nearby
unmanned facility. For the Chashma pressurized water reactor (300 mw),
under International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) safeguards, China
supplied auxiliary equipment, including heaters, condensers, and water
tanks in 1996. China also exported a power plant computer system in 1997
but discussions for Chinese sale of a second facility for the Chashma site
were delayed over financing arrangements (1995-96). The Parr-3 research
reactor (27 kw) at Rawalpindi, under IAEA safeguards, was built and designed
with Chinese assistance in 1989, the study said. The study also gives details
of Chinese exports of missiles, components and related technologies to
Pakistan. China provided ballistic missiles and launchers, up to 30 M-11/DF11
missiles to Pakistan's Sargodha air force base near Lahore in 1992 and
M11 transporter-erector-launchers in 1991. It exported cruise missiles
Hy-1, Hy-2, FL-1 and FL-2 and helped develop Pakistan's indigenous ballistic
missiles Hatf-1 Hatf-2 (similar to M-11), Hatf-3 (similar to M-9) or Pakistani
designation for M-11, follow-on to Hatf-3 (Hatf-M) and Anza surface-to-air
missile.
