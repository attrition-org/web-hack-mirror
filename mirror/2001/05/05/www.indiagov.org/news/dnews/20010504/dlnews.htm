<p>1. The Government has rejected the criticism that its reaction to U.S.
President’s announcement of a new nuclear and global security policy was
taken in haste. An External Affairs Ministry spokesman said, India’s response
was in keeping with the larger global impact. Stating that there has been
no change in its stand on the issue, he said, what the Government welcomed
was the elements which had been advocated by India for long. But the clarification
did not go well with the Congress, which has demanded an explanation from
the government on how it endorsed President Bush’s new policy in a hurry
without arriving at a consensus within the country.&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile Mr. George Bush is sending a special emissary to New Delhi
to discuss the new framework. The special emissary, Deputy Secretary of
State Richard Armitade, will reach Delhi next Thursday. The new security
policy is likely to come up during discussions with the visiting Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who arrived in New Delhi yesterday on a three-day
visit. Moscow is perhaps the strongest opponent of the American programme.
Mr. Igonov’s visit comes within seven months of the Russian President Vladimir
Putin’s India visit last October, when the two countries signed a Declaration
on Strategic partnership to improve the quality of bilateral ties.
<p>2. Bangladesh has accepted India’s invitation for talks in New Delhi
on the boundary issues. The country’s Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
said in Dhaka that a Bangladesh delegation would visit New Delhi later
this month.
<p>3. Indo-US military cooperation is likely to begin this month after
a break of three-years following imposition of economic sanctions after
Pokhran-II. Talking to the Washington Times, the Indian Ambassador to the
U.S.A. Mr. Lalit Mansingh, said that the decision follows the visit of
the External Affairs and Defence Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh to the US
last month. General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint chief of Staff
of USA is to visit India to work on a closer relationship between the two
nations’ military forces. India is interested in developing service to
service relationship, cooperation on military doctrine and training and
also in co-production and sale of weapons.
<p>4. Russian Foreign Minister Mr. Igor Ivanov arrived in New Delhi last
evening on a two day official visit. The main focus of his talks with Indian
Leaders is likely to be on the international issues including Afghanistan
and the US National Defence Missile System. Speaking to reporters at the
airport Mr. Ivanov said that his discussions will also prepare ground for
the coming up visit of the Prime Minister to Moscow later this year. Mr.
Ivanov will call on Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee today, and later have extensive
discussions with the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh.
<p>5. The Central government mediator on Kashmir Mr. K.C.Pant has described
the communication from the Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party&nbsp;
leader Shabir Shah as a step forward to resolve the Kashmir issue. The
letter was delivered by Mr. Shah’s emissaries Saleem Geelani and Mohammed
Abdul Tari in New Delhi yesterday. Mr. Shah has sought certain clarifications
from the Government. Mr. Pant later, told reporters that he would reply
to the letter after studying it.
<p>6. Even as the Bihar government took an offensive posture on the striking
chemists by invoking the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), the All India
Chemists and Druggists Association have called for a nation-wide closure
of drug shops tomorrow in support of their counterparts&nbsp; in Bihar.
The State government has given a fresh directive to all the District Magistrates
to ensure opening of closed medicine shops and lodge an FIR against the
striking chemists and druggists. Over 20,000 retail and wholesale drugs
shops had kept their shutters closed in support of their demand of immediate
withdrawal of Turn-over tax.
<p>7. The Centre has banned the militant organisation, Deendar-e-Anjuman
which was behind the bomb blasts in and outside church premises and other
places in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa. A&nbsp; Home Ministry spokesman
said in New Delhi that the militant organisation has been declared as an
unlawful organisation as its activities were detrimental to the peace,
communal harmony and internal security of the country.
<p>8. In Assam, the security cover for the candidates has been stepped
up in the wake of escalating poll violence. 18 people&nbsp; including the
BJP candidate from Dibrugarh have been killed and 35 injured by suspected
ULFA militants during electioneering in the last one week. The Centre is
rushing five more companies of para-military forces to the state.
<p>9. In West Bengal, five CPI(M) supporters were killed and many injured
in a clash over land dispute at South 24 Parganas district yesterday. Police
sources said firearms, bombs and lethal weapons were used in the clash
at Dariagram village under canning police station. Eight persons have been
arrested.
<p>10. The government has clarified that under the revised guidelines,
foreigners cannot directly adopt an Indian child. The clarification follows
speculation in the media that Indian children given in Inter-country adoption
may be exploited for immoral purposes or sold illegally for huge sums to
foreigners. The Central Adoption Resource Agency, an autonomous body under
the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry, in a statement yesterday said
that all foreign parents, including NRIs desirous of adopting an Indian
child, have to be sponsored by a licensed adoption agency in their own
country which is permitted to work in India.
<p>11. The Sensitive Index of Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday suffered
a loss of 44 points to close at 3494.
<p>12. India take on Yemen in the return match of the Asian Zone Group
‘8’ World Cup Football qualifying match at Sa’ana in Yemen today. It is
a do and die situation for India. In the home match in Bagalore last month,
India held Yemen to a 1-1 draw in the first leg.&nbsp;</td>
