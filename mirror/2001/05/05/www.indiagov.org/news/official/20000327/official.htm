<p><b>Visit of H.E. Mr. Bulent Ecevit, Prime Minister of the Republic of
Turkey</b></center>

<p>At the invitation of Prime Minister of India, H.E. Mr. Bulent Ecevit,
Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, accompanied by Madame Rahsan
Ecevit and a high-level delegation will pay a State visit to India from
March 31 – April 2, 2000. A business delegation is accompanying the Turkish
Prime Minister to participate in the fourth meeting of the Indo-Turkish
Joint Business Council (JBC) also to be held during the visit.
<p>High level contacts have been a feature of India-Turkey relations. Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal’s visit in 1986 started the current phase of interaction.
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited Turkey in 1988. President Kenan Evren
visited India in 1989 which was reciprocated by President S.D. Sharma in
1993. President Suleyman Demirel came to India in 1995 and President K.R.
Narayanan paid a return visit in 1998. Vice-President Krishan Kant visited
Turkey in 1998 to participate in the 75th anniversary of the Turkish Republic.
<p>Prime Minister Ecevit’s forthcoming visit is expected to provide a strong
impulse to the strengthening of Indo-Turkish cooperation, particularly
in the economic and commercial spheres. The visit also re-affirms the cultural
affinity between the two peoples, to which Prime Minister Ecevit’s personal
contribution has taken the form of translation into Turkish language of
Bhagavat-Gita and Rebindranath Tagore’s ‘Gitanjali’.
<p>Apart from meeting with the Prime Minister, the visiting dignitary is
to call on the President and the Vice-President and meet with senior Ministers
of the Government of India and the Leader of the Opposition. He will be
conferred with an honorary degree of D.Litt. (Deshikottam) by Visva Bharati
at Shantiniketan. Prime Minister Ecevit will address business and industry
leaders of the two countries at a meeting organized by FICCI.
<p>A number of agreements, including cooperation in the field of agriculture
and establishment of mechanism for political consultations between the
foreign ministries of India and Turkey, would be signed.

<p>India and the United States are pleased to announce their agreement
to commence negotiation of a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty soon, which
we hope to conclude this year.
<p>This proposed MLAT is a natural follow-on to the new Extradition Treaty
between India and the United States that entered into force on July 21,
1999.
<p>Conclusion of an MLAT would enhance law enforcement cooperation between
India and the United States by providing a streamlined and effective mechanism
for assisting one another in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.
