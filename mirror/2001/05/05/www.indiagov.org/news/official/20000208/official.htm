<br><font size=+1>Joint US-India Statement on Counter-terrorism Working
Group</font></center>

<p>Last month, the United States and India agreed to establish a Joint
Working Group on Counterterrorism. The agreement was announced following
meetings between Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott and Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh in London.&nbsp;
<p>The inaugural meeting of the U.S.-India Counter-terrorism Working Group
was held today in Washington. Ambassador Michael A. Sheehan, U.S. Coordinator
for Counterterrorism, hosted the meeting at the Department of State. The
Indian delegation was headed by Joint Secretary Alok Prasad of the Ministry
of External Affairs. Both delegations included an interagency group of
counter-terrorism and law enforcement officials.&nbsp;
<p>The two sides expressed concern at the growing menace of international
terrorism, extremism, and drug trafficking. The two sides unequivocally
condemned all acts, methods, and practices of terrorism as criminal and
unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical,
ideological, racial, ethnic, religious, or any other nature that may be
invoked to justify them.&nbsp;
<p>The two sides agreed to intensify their joint cooperation to ensure
that the perpetrators of the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 are
brought to justice, as part of their joint efforts to combat international
terrorism.&nbsp;
<p>The Indian Government agreed to the U.S. offer of Anti-terrorism Assistance
programs, the specifics to be determined in future visits. The group also
decided to convene a meeting of each side's legal experts in April to discuss
the Indian-proposed UN Terrorism Convention.&nbsp;
<p>Inter-agency teams from the two countries agreed on a range of measures
to enhance cooperation between the two countries to combat international
terrorism. The two sides would share experience, exchange information,
and coordinate approaches and action.&nbsp;
<p>Both India and the United States have a shared interest in strengthening
a regime to counter international terrorism. This working group is intended
to enhance the effectiveness of our efforts to counter international terrorism
worldwide.&nbsp;
<p>The next meeting of the U.S.-India Counter-terrorism Working Group will
be held in India on mutually agreed dates.
