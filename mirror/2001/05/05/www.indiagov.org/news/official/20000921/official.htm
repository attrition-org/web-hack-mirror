<br>India has always had an abiding commitment to the cause of international
peace and stability. In this context, India has contributed generously
to U.N. peace-keeping operations in different parts of the world. Indian
armed forces personnel have addressed themselves to all situations with
a high degree of professionalism and
<br>military capabilities.
<p>India has participated in UN peace-keeping operations in Sierra Leone
for the past two years, first as a part of UN observer mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL) and then as a part of UN mission to Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).
This was a reflection of India’s unflagging involvement with U.N. peace-keeping
operations as well as its long standing ties of friendship and cooperation
with Africa.
<p>The Government of India has decided to withdraw India’s contingent from
UNAMSIL in a phased manner.&nbsp; This has been conveyed to the United
Nations through appropriate diplomatic channels.&nbsp; It is our view that
an opportunity should be given to other countries to take part in the peace-keeping
mission in Sierra Leone.
<p>India remains resolutely committed to UN peace-keeping efforts and is
willing to consider joining peace-keeping missions in other parts of the
world, if requested.
<p>With respect to the continuation of General Jetley as Force Commander
of the UNAMSIL, a decision would be taken at the appropriate time.&nbsp;
In consonance with the decision to withdraw the Indian contingent from
UNAMSIL, the appointment of a new Force Commander from India is not anticipated.
