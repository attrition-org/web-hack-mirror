<p><b>Agenda for the Indo-German Partnership in the 21st Century</b></center>

<p>The Governments of India and Germany keeping in view the excellent relationship
between their respective countries, have agreed to expand and intensify
their relationship and to introduce therein a new strategic dimension.&nbsp;
<p>Towards this end the Foreign Ministers of India and Germany have adopted
the following “Agenda for the Indo-German Partnership in the 21st Century”
on 18 May 2000 which would anchor and guide the relationship in a rapidly
changing international environment.&nbsp;
<p>India and Germany are natural partners: Basic common interests and shared
democratic values as well as the trust developed through good relations
over a long period of time constitute a sound basis for a joint approach
to the challenges of the future.&nbsp;
<p>Both countries are determined to exploit the vast potential of an intensified
bilateral partnership, especially in the economic, cultural, scientific
and technological fields. They also wish to work together more closely
to meet new global challenges, sharing the common goal to promote peace,
stability and security as well as economic prosperity in their respective
regions and beyond.&nbsp;
<p>Both sides are convinced that the further strengthening of Indo-German
friendship would bear fruit and benefit people of both our countries. They
therefore call upon all concerned agencies and organisations, to undertake
an active role in the implementation of this Agenda.&nbsp;
<p><b>(1) Bilateral political relations&nbsp;</b>
<p>The Governments of India and Germany accord the highest priority to
the exchange of high-level visits for the intensification of bilateral
dialogue.&nbsp;
<p>The two Governments will aim for regular and frequent exchange of visits
at Head of State and Government level. The Foreign Ministers would endeavour
to meet annually. The two partners have also agreed to benefit from the
opportunity for high-level talks and consultations during or on the occasion
of international conferences or meetings.&nbsp;
<p>The existing framework of regular consultations at senior official level
is to be developed further. This particularly applies to the annual consultations
of the State Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and the Strategic Dialogue.&nbsp;
<p>India and Germany also propose to promote consultations and exchange
of views between the diplomatic missions of the two countries in third
countries and multilateral organisations.&nbsp;
<p>Both sides appreciate the special significance of contacts between Parliamentarians
of the two countries in shaping the relations between the two countries
and recommend a further intensification of these contacts.&nbsp;
<p>The two sides recognise the Indo-German dialogue could usefully be extended
to the non-governmental level as well. Both Governments will take steps
to better involve associations, federations and social groups in the dialogue
and encourage them to develop their own initiatives.&nbsp;
<p>Both Governments welcome the work of the Indo-German Consultative Group
whose recommendations have provided valuable momentum to bilateral relations
in all areas. They expect further impetus and initiative from this independent
body.&nbsp;
<p><b>(2) Security policy / disarmament issues&nbsp;</b>
<p>Both Governments are committed to the aim of global disarmament and
non-proliferation despite differing opinions on how this goal is to be
achieved.&nbsp;
<p>They recall that as early as in 1993 the two Governments had agreed
to hold regular consultations on issues of disarmament, arms control and
non-proliferation which are to be used intensively to narrow differences
on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Both Governments will continue
the exchange of views on disarmament policy in the UN and extend this to
include topics dealt with at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament (CD).
They agree furthermore to discuss security policy issues within their bilateral
Strategic Dialogue.&nbsp;
<p>The two Governments acknowledge that the research institutes active
in the field of security and strategic studies should be more involved
in the security policy dialogue, for example by holding seminars with security
policy and military experts from both sides.&nbsp;
<p>Both Governments advocate stronger confidence-building and conflict
prevention measures. They welcome in particular the progress attained within
the ASEAN Regional Forum in which India and the European Union participate
as ASEAN dialogue partners.&nbsp;
<p><b>(3) Economic relations&nbsp;</b>
<p>India and Germany share a long and successful tradition of cooperation
in the fields of trade, industry and technological advancement. The two
Governments acknowledge that economic reforms and accelerated economic
growth in India, as well as improved growth in Germany, have vastly increased
the scope for further development of bilateral economic relations.&nbsp;
<p>Both sides will endeavour to tie on to the dynamism of the boom in economic
relations initiated by the Indian reform process at the beginning of the
nineties. Both Governments will therefore do their utmost to improve the
framework conditions and pursue their efforts to open up markets, simplify
procedures as well as remove identified obstacles in the legal and administrative
spheres with the objective of increasing bilateral trade and direct investment
in both countries.&nbsp;
<p>The German Government will employ its foreign trade instruments to actively
promote bilateral economic relations.&nbsp;
<p>The participation of businesses in trade fairs in both countries is
considered to be an important approach to extend trade as well as to foster
cooperation between companies.&nbsp;
<p>Both sides reiterate the benefits of bilateral visits by economic delegations
from the Federal Lander (states) or the Indian Union States. They will
strive to intensify such exchanges of visits.&nbsp;
<p>The two Governments will encourage the economic federations and institutions
in their countries to continue their dialogue. With the Indian Economic
Committee on the German side and the German Committee on the Indian side,
the federations have suitable fora for such dialogue.&nbsp;
<p>The two sides reiterate their will to work out further proposals for
expansion of the economic relations within the Indo-German Joint Commission
on Industrial and Economic Cooperation and its working groups on infrastructure,
coal and tourism. Both sides consider the prospects for cooperation in
the fields of information technology, biotechnology, telecommunications,
environmental technology (including those related to infrastructure such
as sewage treatment), mechanical engineering, chemical and pharmaceutical
industries, food processing and modern technical services to be particularly
promising. They encourage the working group for infrastructure to work
on further proposals for improved cooperation in the energy sector and
to discuss options for cooperation in other fields, for example in the
modernisation / privatisation of airports and ports and in the telecommunications
sector.&nbsp;
<p>India and Germany realise that cooperation between small and medium-sized
enterprises in the two countries is particularly important for economic
relations and emphasise that these companies rely particularly on a favourable
economic environment as well as reliable and clear framework conditions
and structures.&nbsp;
<p>India and Germany believe that there is a favourable investment climate
in both the countries to be exploited by investors. The German Government
points that promotion instruments designed to foster investment in new
Federal Lander (states) are also available to Indian companies&nbsp;
<p>Both sides endeavour to expand bilateral tourism and welcome in this
context the activities of the working group on tourism.&nbsp;
<p><b>(4) Relations in science, research and technology&nbsp;</b>
<p>Cooperation in Science, Research and Technology has been one of the
main pillars of Indo-German friendship and for imparting their bilateral
relationship with a dynamic and a forward looking outlook. The two Governments
intend to expand this cooperation for the mutual benefit of both countries
considering greater involvement of industry in particular to be desirable.
Both sides regard the prospects for the further extension of this cooperation
to be good: outstanding scientific resources on both sides and a broad
foundation of legal arrangements between both Governments, as well as between
intermediary organisations and research institutes, which should be involved
more intensively in the future.&nbsp;
<p>The two Governments consider the bilateral Committee on Science &amp;
Technology (CST) and the CST Coordinators to be suitable instruments to
better coordinate and concentrate the many activities which at the same
time can provide crucial impetus for the deepening of scientific and technological
cooperation. Both sides endeavour to rapidly implement the recommendations
made by the bilateral CST Committee in January 2000. They believe that
intensified cooperation between small and medium-sized firms and research
institutes requires particular attention.&nbsp;
<p>Since early 1999 a Technology Area Manager has been employed in the
Indo-German Chamber of Commerce in New Delhi to act as a port of call for
German and Indian small and medium-sized enterprises and to initiate and
prepare research and development cooperation measures.&nbsp;
<p>The two Governments welcome the positive developments in the exchange
of scientists and students, in particular the new exchange programme between
the five Indian Institutes of Technology and six Technical Universities
in Germany, which includes a training placement in a German company, as
well as the introduction of numerous English-language study courses at
German institutions of higher education. They emphasise that academic exchange
should be a key component of future cooperation and should be intensified.
They will support the extension of current programmes in this sphere and
the launching of new initiatives where necessary.&nbsp;
<p>The Arrangement concerning scientific cooperation concluded in February
1999 between the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) and the Conference
of Rectors and Presidents of Universities and other Higher Education Institutions
in the Federal Republic of Germany (HRK) sets the stage for enhanced cooperation
between Indian and German universities. The perspectives for an increase
in the level of exchanges for students and scientists ought to be used
to the full, in particular by setting up partnerships between Universities.
Extending academic exchange cannot be left to Governmental agencies alone.
Both sides therefore advocate a private Indo-German scholarship fund to
be set up by industry with the task of mobilising funds from German and
Indian private sponsors and companies.&nbsp;
<p><b>(5) Cultural Relations&nbsp;</b>
<p>The Governments of India and Germany appreciate the high level of cooperation
in the cultural sector. They underline that cultural cooperation makes
a valuable contribution to increasing knowledge and mutual understanding
and therefore occupies a key position in bilateral relations.&nbsp;
<p>The two sides agree that the Indian and German institution and non-governmental
organisations active in the respective host country should be more intensively
involved in cultural cooperation. Both sides recommend closer interaction
between the institutions working in the cultural sphere and decision-makers
in industry so as to attract the interest of the latter for joint projects.&nbsp;
<p>The Indo-German Friendship Societies in the two countries are important
institutions for promoting cultural exchange and understanding. In acknowledging
the excellent work undertaken by these institutions, the two sides recognised
the need for the greater involvement of younger citizens of both countries
and key figures in politics, economics and society, within the scope of
their activities.&nbsp;
<p>The German Festival in India opening in September 2000 will be an opportunity
for both Governments to further extend cultural links.&nbsp;
<p>Cultural and scientific cooperation between India and Germany must also
be geared to the future. It should help to provide people in both countries
with technological capabilities enabling them to meet the complex challenges
of ongoing globalisation in many areas of life. Scientific and cultural
players can make a crucial contribution to ensuring that the people in
both countries perceive themselves as subjects rather than objects of the
globalisation process and thus play an active role in its evolution.&nbsp;
<p>Indo-German cooperation will therefore make increased use of the potential
of culture and science to establish peoples networks and promote dialogue
beyond national borders. Productive use must be made of advances in communication
and media technology. There is broad agreement that existing cooperation
instruments need to be examined and possibly adapted to the changed framework
conditions.&nbsp;
<p><b>(6) Air traffic&nbsp;</b>
<p>In order to ensure that air traffic between the two countries is able
to meet the increased demands arising from growing bilateral interaction,
enhanced people to people contacts and tourism, the German and the Indian
Governments will seek a corresponding increase in the air traffic capacity
between India and Germany. This will be part of a step-by-step plan which
establishes changes to the so-called hard rights needed to increase the
number of flights.&nbsp;
<p><b>(7) Environmental policy&nbsp;</b>
<p>Aware that environmental problems arising from rapid industrialisation
and urbanisation have not just local but also increasingly regional and
global repercussions, both Governments resolve to increase cooperation
in the field of environmental protection, bilaterally and within the framework
of multilateral agreements. They refer in this context to the Memorandum
of Understanding signed by their Ministries of Environment in September
1998. They will pay special attention to questions of climate change and
bio-diversity.&nbsp;
<p><b>(8) Media policy&nbsp;</b>
<p>The two sides acknowledge the important role played by the free media
in both India and Germany in shaping the public image of the other country.
They believe that media reporting in both countries needs to be placed
on a broader and more differentiated information basis. They therefore
advocate a broad and free flow of information between the media of both
sides. They suggest that the media organisations themselves take the initiative
to strengthen the exchange of information and journalists.&nbsp;
<p><b>(9) Cooperation in the United Nations&nbsp;</b>
<p>India and Germany will cooperate in ongoing efforts to reform the United
Nations. They agree that the structure, working methods and the financing
of the United Nations have to be adapted to the realities of today so that
the UN can successfully rise to the challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp;
<p>Both sides reaffirm the need for reform and balanced enlargement of
the Security Council of the United Nations to make it more representative
and improve its ability to act and function properly. Both Governments
will do their utmost to ensure the reform debate to be intensified and
carried out in a targeted fashion. Germany and India stress their readiness
to assume responsibility as permanent members of the Security Council as
part of such reform.&nbsp;
<p><b>(10) Cooperation in the fight against terrorism and drug abuse&nbsp;</b>
<p>Both Governments are resolved to strengthen Indo-German cooperation
on fighting terrorism and organised crime in all forms. They attach particular
importance to the signing, ratification and implementation of the UN conventions
in the field of drugs control and terrorism. They underline the need for
international cooperation in fighting drugs trafficking and terrorism.
Similarly they strive for close coordination in the negotiations on UN
conventions to combat terrorism.<b></b>
