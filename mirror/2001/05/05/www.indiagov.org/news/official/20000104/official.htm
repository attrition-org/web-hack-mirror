<br><b>Tatkaal Scheme for out-of-turn passports</b></center>

<p>Minister of State for External Affairs Shri Ajit Kumar Panja announced
on 24 December, 1999 the introduction of a 'Tatkaal' Scheme for issue of
out-of-turn passports with effect from 1st January, 2000. Under this scheme,
passports would be issued on the payment of additional fee over and above
the normal passport application fee. The proposed additional fee structure
is based on the fact that the issue of one out-of-turn passport disrupts
the normal chain of issue of passports and involves extra amount of work,
manpower and equipment required for the issue of five normal passports.
<p>&nbsp;The additional fee for out-of-turn (Tatkaal) passports would be
as follows:
<p>i) For issue of fresh out-of-turn (Tatkaal) Passports within seven working
days of the date of application an additional fee of Rs. 1500/- plus the
passport fee as applicable in India and Rs. 3750/- plus the passport fee
as applicable abroad.
<p>ii) For issue of fresh out-of-turn (Tatkaal) passports between seven
to twenty-eight working days of the date of application an additional fee
of Rs. 1000/- plus the passport fee as applicable in India and Rs. 2250
plus the passport fee as applicable abroad.
<p>iii) For issue of duplicate out-of-turn (Tatkaal) Passpost within five
working days of the date of application in lieu of an ordinary passport
where it has been stolen, damaged destroyed or for any other such reasons
an additional fee of Rs. 2500/- plus the passport fee as applicable in
India and no additional fee abroad.
<p>iv) In all re-issue cases after expiry of ten / twenty years' validity,
where passport is to be re-issued within five working days of the date
of application an additional fee of Rs. 1500/- plus the passport fee as
applicable in India and Rs. 3750/- plus the passport fee as applicable
abroad.
<p>&nbsp; The 'Tatkaal' scheme would only be applicable in cases where
either the police verification report is not required (minors less than
15 years of age) or where a passport can be issued on post police verification
basis (duplicate passport / re-issue of passport without change in address,
Government servants with NOC and their spouses and applications with Verification
Certificates). Initially, passports under the Tatkaal scheme would be granted
in cases where there is a genuine urgency and would cover the following
categories:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>i) patients requiring to go abroad for medical treatment (without any
enhanced fee).
<p>ii) in case of death abroad of a close relative (spouse, father, mother,
children, children's spouses, grand children, brothers and their spouses,
and sisters and their spouses) of applicant (without any enhanced fee).
<p>iii) students requiring a passport for appearing in examinations such
as SAT (without any enhanced fee if the earnings of the parents / guardian
of the student applicant is less than Rs. 2000/- per month).
<p>iv) students going abroad to join foreign universities (without any
enhanced fee if the earnings of the parents / guardian of the student applicant
is less than Rs. 2000/- per month.
<p>v) businessmen wishing to travel abroad urgently for trade, conferences,
trade fair etc.
<p>vi) blood relatives of a person residing abroad who is serious ill.
<p>vii) spouse, parents, parents-in-law, children, brother, sister, brother-in-law
and sister-in-law of individuals working abroad.
<p>viii) winners of promotional awards and schemes where foreign travel
is a prize / incentive.
<p>ix) spouses of officials / passport holders going abroad and availing
of companion ticket.
<p>x) for marriage or honeymoon after marriage.
<p>xi) individuals wishing to go abroad to attend marriage of relatives
such as children, grand children, brother, sister, niece or nephew.
