<br>The Regional Passport Office, Chennai has developed its own website
to active collaboration with National Information Centre, Chennai.&nbsp;
The website can be accessed at http://www/tn.nic.in/passport.&nbsp;
<p>2. A special feature of the website is the application status enquiry.&nbsp;
Anyone willing to know his/her application status has to enter file number
and date of birth after accessing the website and the display will inform
not only deficiency, if any, but also solution to fulfil the formalities
required.&nbsp; To start with, status will be updated every week and our
endeavour is to update the status on daily basis in the coming months.
<p>3. On 19th July, 2000, a Passport Application Collection Centre (PACC)
was inaugurated at Pondicherry by Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Hon’ble Minister

Complex, Maraimalai Adigal Salai, Pondicherry will annually serve about
30000 applicants hailing from Karaikkal, Villupuram, Cuddalore districts
