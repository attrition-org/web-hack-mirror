<p>Since the sudden escalation of tension and consequent violence, authorities
in Israel, in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and from other concerned
governments have been in regular contact with the government of India.&nbsp;
Prior to these developments both PNA and Israel had repeatedly sought India’s
intervention in the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP).
<p>&nbsp;This continuation, indeed, escalation of violence; deliberate
acts of provocation; excessive use of force; wanton killings of innocents
including, most sadly, children, desecration and damage to places of worship;
taking hostages and retaliation killing of soldiers are all acts that contribute
to a chain of event and reaction; such acts contribute directly to a descent
into uncontrollable disorder.
<p>&nbsp;This must cease.&nbsp; We urge all sides to desist from provocative
acts, use of indiscriminate force and encouragement to violence.&nbsp;
Peace and normalcy must immediately be resorted, the MEPP not permitted
to collapse irretrievably.
<p>&nbsp;This is not simply an Israel-Palestine or even a regional issue;
it is a matter that concerns all of humanity.

<p><b>Visit of Turkish infrastructure delegation</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;At the invitation of Ministry of External Affairs, Government
of India, a Turkish delegation, led by Deputy Under Secretary in the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Mithat Balkan visited Delhi from 12-13 October,
2000 to discuss setting up of a joint working group on infrastructure under
the aegis of the Indo-Turkish Joint Economic Commission.&nbsp; The visit
was a part of efforts being made by both countries, since the landmark
visit by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit in
<br>March, to intensify their trade and economic cooperation.&nbsp; A certain
momentum in bilateral economic relations has already been visible in terms
of recent increase in trade figures.
<p>&nbsp;Ambassador Balkan, accompanied by a delegation representing both
Turkish economic ministries and private sector construction companies,
held extensive discussions with Secretary (East), Ministry of External
Affairs, Shri K.V. Rajan and at Ministries of Surface Transport and Railways.&nbsp;
The visiting delegation also had interactive meetings at industry level,
including Overseas Construction Council of India (OCCI), National Highway
Authority of India (NHAI), and National Building
<br>Construction Corporation (NBCC) etc.&nbsp; The Turkish delegation saw
promising opportunities of cooperation with their Indian counterparts in
both India and Turkey; and in third countries, especially Central Asia.
It was decided that a representative office would be opened in India by
them to ensure close and sustained collaboration with the Indian industry.
<p>&nbsp;The two-day discussions proved fruitful and are expected to lead
to early formation of the proposed working group.
