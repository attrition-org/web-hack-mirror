of the member countries for sustainable economic development of the BIMST-EC
region, with emphasis on the use of environmentally friendly technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The member countries recognised the need to enhance the technological capabilities
of the BIMST-EC region through regional projects, and by strengthening
the technology transfer capabilities in the BIMST-EC region in order to
develop interaction between R&amp;D and industry for commercial benefit
through quality production. The meeting recognised the need to facilitate
the growth of technology-intensive ventures and encourage innovation for
the development of new and appropriate technologies, as well as the importance
of making concerted efforts to overcome the 'Digital Divide' within the
BIMST-EC region.
<p>The member countries agreed to the creation of databases to facilitate

the publication of a BIMST-EC Technology Newsletter.&nbsp; The meeting
further agreed to promote exchange of trained scientific &amp; technical
personnel and resource persons within the BIMST-EC framework, and to promote
research and development in emerging areas of science and technology. It
was decided to identify nodal points in the BIMST-EC countries for promoting
cooperation in science and technology among the BIMST- EC countries. The
meeting identified a number of priority areas for mounting regional projects
and cooperative programmes: e.g., agro-food science &amp; technology, including
storage and preservation, soil and water management, etc., agricultural
technology &amp; agro- instrumentation, biotechnology, food technology,
soil &amp; water management, medical science &amp; instrumentation, herbal
