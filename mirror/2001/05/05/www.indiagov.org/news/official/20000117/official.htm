<br><b>Press Release</b>
<br><b>High Commission of India</b>
<br>Islamabad
<p>January 16, 2000.&nbsp;
<p>Mr. P. Moses, a staff member of this Mission was presented at the 9
PM PTV News bulletin today and unfounded and baseless allegations were
made against him. He has been abducted and continues to be held in illegal
custody by Government of Pakistan while he was on his way in a taxi cab
to Fatima Church in Sector F-8, Islamabad. It was amply clear that he has
been made to make false statements under extreme duress on the TV as several
injuries indicating physical assault and torture were visible on his face.&nbsp;
<p>2. The High Commission of India rejects the allegations made against
Mr. P. Moses as unfounded and totally baseless. The High Commission strongly
condemns such despicable acts. It needs to be pointed out that the treatment
meted out to Mr. Moses is in gross violation of all norms and conventions
of diplomatic interaction, provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations, 1961 and Code of Conduct for Treatment of Diplomatic personnel
in India and Pakistan signed by the two countries in August 1992. However,
the Government of Pakistan has not considered it necessary even to inform
the High Commission of India any details about the illegal detention of
a bonafide employee of the High Commission. Even the local police have
refused to register a First Information Report on the case.&nbsp;
<p>3. The High Commission of India has lodged a strong protest at this
action of the Government of Pakistan and has called upon it to take urgent
steps for the immediate release and safe return of Mr. Moses. The High
Commission has reiterated to the Government of Pakistan that it is the
responsibility of the latter to ensure the safety and security of all personnel
in this High Commission. The Government of Pakistan has also been held
fully responsible for any injury - physical or otherwise - to Mr. Moses
during his illegal detention.
