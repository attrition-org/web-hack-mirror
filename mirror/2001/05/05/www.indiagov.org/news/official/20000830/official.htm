<br><font color="#000000">Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, will
now leave for his visit to the United Nations and the USA on September
7, 2000.&nbsp; The re-scheduling of the departure date on the advice of
his doctors would have no bearing on the major elements of his programme.&nbsp;
The programme in New York 8th September onwards remains unchanged.&nbsp;
The Prime Minister will, however, not visit San Francisco but proceed directly
from New York to Washington D.C. No changes are envisaged in his programme
in Washington D.C. in the context of his official visit to the USA.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">The residential premises of two Indian diplomats
based in Islamabad, Shri Vipin Handa, Counsellor and Gp. Capt. S.K. Jayaswal,
Air Adviser, were intruded upon by the operatives of the Pakistan intelligence
agencies today.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">In the first incident, five intelligence operatives,
claiming to be employees of the Capital Development Authority, entered
the house of Shri Vipin Handa at 1540 hours while his wife, teenage daughter
and young son were by themselves at home.&nbsp; They went all over the
house, rummaged through their personal belongings and made threatening
statements before leaving. They refused to show their identity cards when
asked to do so. In the second incident, six intelligence Agents forced
their entry into the residence of the Air Adviser at 1545 hours after threatening
his servant’s family with a gun.&nbsp; The entire drama was replayed at
the Air Adviser’s residence as well.&nbsp; These incidents follow a pattern
of calibrated and escalating harassment and brazen intimidation by Pakistani
authorities of members of the High Commission of India.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The Ministry summoned the Pakistani Deputy High
Commissioner this evening and lodged a strong protest deploring the blatant
and gross violation of the privacy and sanctity of the residential premises
of the Indian diplomats.&nbsp; The Ministry demanded that measures be taken
to ensure that there are no repetitions of such incidents in future and
sought adequate security for all personnel of the High Commission of India,
Islamabad and their residential premises.</font><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
