<p>On 4th December, 2000 ONGC Videsh signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with PDVSA of Venezuela in Caracas. Under the MOU, ONGC will enter into
exploration and production of oil in Venezuela. The Venezuelan side has
offered six blocks for the exploration and production. The investment of
ONGC would be in the range of over US $ 50 million. This would be the largest
single investment of India in Latin America.&nbsp;
<p>2.&nbsp; This is the first time that Venezuela has offered oil field
concessions to a foreign company outside the international tendering procedure.&nbsp;
<p>3.&nbsp; After signing the MOU, the ONGC Videsh delegation had a meeting
with the President of Venezuela. The President described the MOU&nbsp;
as an indication of the Venezuelan desire to strengthen economic and commercial
relations with India.&nbsp;
<p>4.&nbsp; Venezuela is the third largest exporter of oil in the world
with over 3 million barrels per day. PDVSA, the Venezuelan State Oil Company,
is the third largest oil company in the world with a turnover of US $ 50
billion.&nbsp;
<p>5.&nbsp; Petroleum Sector has emerged as the focus area of cooperation
between India and Venezeula. A Joint Working Group has been meeting since
1999 and has identified a number of areas for collaboration between the
two countries. India has started buying crude oil from Venezuela this year.
Oil India Limited is seeking technology from PDVSA for development of the
heavy oil fields in Rajasthan.&nbsp;
<p>6.&nbsp; Venezuela, whose oil income this year is US $ 30 billion, is
an attractive market for Indian exports. India is exporting pharmaceuticals,
chemicals, software and engineering products.&nbsp;
<p>7.&nbsp; In June 2001 an exclusive exhibition of engineering products
of India will be held in Caracas in collaboration with the Engineering
Export Promotion Council of India.&nbsp;
