<p>The Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan was summoned to the Ministry
of External Affairs this afternoon and a strong protest was lodged with
him at an incident of violation of the Line of Control west of Naushera
by Pakistani forces on 27 February 2000, in which seven Indian soldiers
were killed and one soldier is still missing. The Deputy High commissioner
was asked to convey to the authorities in Pakistan the need to desist from
such violations and to respect at all times the Line of Control established
under the Simla Agreement.&nbsp;
<p>The Government of India has noted that in the wake of the military reverses
suffered by Pakistan following its armed intrusion and aggression in Kargil
in 1999, the Pakistani forces have intensified their violations of the
Line of Control, including unprovoked firing and the promotion of terrorism
in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. We have also noted the increasingly strident statements
made by Pakistani leaders, which provide active encouragement and support
to terrorist organizations operating from Pakistani territory.&nbsp;
<p>Pakistan's activities and statements are clearly intended with the cynical
purpose of attracting international attention. The Government of India
remains firm in its resolve to combat all violations of the Line of Control,
including cross border terrorism and to preserve and maintain the security
and territorial integrity of the country.&nbsp;
