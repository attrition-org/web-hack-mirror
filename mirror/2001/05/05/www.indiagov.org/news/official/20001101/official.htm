<br>The G-15 Foreign Ministers met in Mexico City from 30-31 October 2000,
to review implementation of the decisions taken at the Tenth Summit in
Cairo in May this year, to prepare for the Eleventh Summit to be held in
Jakarta, Indonesia next year and assess the response of the G-8 countries
to the concerns of developing countries, as reflected in the outcome of
the recent Okinawa Summit.
<p>Mr. Ajit Kumar Panja, Minister of State for External Affairs, led the
Indian delegation to the Mexico meeting, which comprised Shri S.Devare,
Secretary (Economic relations), Ministry of External Affairs, H.E. G.S.Iyer,
Ambassador of India to Medico, Smt. Suryakanthi Tripathi, Joint Secretary
(Economic Development and Multilateral Economic Relations),Ministry of
External Affairs and Dr. Mrs. Nandhini Iyer Krishna,
<br>Director (MER), Ministry of External Affairs.
<p>The meeting considered a wide range of issues including poverty alleviation,
trade and investment, environmental issues, information and communication
technologies, incentives for small and medium enterprises reform of the
international financial architecture and human resource development.&nbsp;
Over 14 Ministers attended the meeting.&nbsp; The President of Mexico,
Emesto Zedillo Ponoe de Leon, who received the heads of delegations, stressed
the crucial role that the G-15 could play as a
<br>strategic forum based on South South cooperation.
<p>Mr. Panja, set the tone for discussions on two of the crucial issues
on the agenda of the Mexico meeting, notably poverty alleviation and human
resource development. Acknowledging that poverty eradication was among
the most daunting challenges facing the international community, Mr. Panja
highlighted the range of policies and programmes India had adopted at the
domestic level to combat poverty.&nbsp; He stressed that sustained economic
growth was crucial to combat poverty and that the efforts of
<br>developing countries at the national level needed to be reinforced
by corresponding efforts at the international level to render the multilateral
trading regime and the international monetary and financial systems more
responsive to the objectives of poverty and development.Mr. Panja's call
to evolve a common definition of poverty, that was based not merely on
monetary baselines but a more holistic approach that
<br>addressed issues such as individual calorific intake or consumption
basket, struck a responsive chord in many delegations.&nbsp; Where progress
was recorded in combating poverty he also stressed that it was imperative
to take necessary measures to sustain such gains and prevent re-slippage
below the poverty line.
<p>On the issue of human resource development, Shri Panja pointed out that
HRD was crucial in the new knowledge-based global economy and needed to
be seen not just as a tool to improve literacy or vocational skills but
to empower entire sections of the population.&nbsp; He stressed the crucial
importance of providing compulsory primary education for all.&nbsp; Mr.
Panja also argued for a special emphasis on the education of the girl child
and called for a special fund to be set up to counter the complex socio
<br>economic or familial obstacles to the education of the girl child.&nbsp;
He pointed out that the experience of developed countries revealed the
catalytic impact of educating the girl child, which was reflected in higher
productivity, health etc.&nbsp; Mr. Panja also called on international
funding agencies to support domestic outlays on education.&nbsp; In recognition
of the importance India attached to human resource development, Mr. Panja
also pointed out that since 1964 India has been training over 1500 officials
from developing countries every year in diverse fields, and further indicated
support for the setting up of a G-15 Human Resources Training Programme.&nbsp;
He statement was widely appreciated with many delegations urging further
discussions of these issues at the next G-15 Summit.
<p>Shri Panja also stressed that if the G-15 was to be effective it would
need to evolve a mechanism for follow up and implementation of its Summit
decisions.&nbsp; This call received wide support and acclamation. Shri
Panja also urged the G-15 to concentrate on consolidating their identity
and effectiveness as a strategic player on the international
<br>arena rather than discussing further expansion of membership and replicating
the attributes of other universal membership developing country groupings
such as the G-77.
<p>After two days of negotiations the G-15 meeting adopted a statement
on the key issues on the agenda, which fully reflects India's interests
and positions.&nbsp; The meeting endorsed the establishment of a G-15 Human
Resources Training Programme, the details of which will be worked out.It
also agreed that the theme of the Eleventh Summit would be 'Development
and the Digital Divide' and that a task force on
<br>Information and&nbsp; Communication Technologies would be established
to facilitate substantive preparations on this issue.
