<p>An Inter-ministerial delegation comprising Director General of Military
Operations Lt. Gen. N.C. Vij, Mr. B.S. Lalli, Joint Secretary (G), MOD
and Mr. Dinkar Srivastava, Joint Secretary (UNP), MEA visited Sierra Leone
from 08 to 11 June, 2000. The delegation visited the Indian troops at Daru,
Hastings and Rogberi and found them in high spirits. They also held consultations
with the President, Vice President and Deputy Defence Minister of Sierra
Leone to seek their assistance for the release of the Indian hostages.
However, the delegation confirmed that the hostages are in good health
and the food was being supplied to them on a daily basis by own troops.
The delegation also took stock of the logistic problems being faced by
our troops on ground for which the rectification measures have already
been instituted. This includes the important aspect of regular delivery
of mail to them.
<p>2. The delegation also had consultations with their British counterparts
at London. At New York, the delegation briefed the Defence Peace Keeping
Operations head, Mr. Miyet along with the representatives of the Permanent
Mission of India. Besides giving an assessment of the ground situation
in Sierra Leone, the delegation conveyed India’s grave concern with regard
to the security and well being of the Indian hostages. It was emphasized
most unequivocally that under no circumstances will the release of Indian
troops be allowed to be linked with any political bargaining. It was also
clarified that the Indian troops have been deployed only in ‘peace keeping’
role. At Washington, the delegation along with the Indian Ambassador met
Mr. Thomas Pickering, Under Secretary of State and Mr. Carl Inderfurth,
Assistant Secretary of State and the serious concerns of the Government
of India with regard to the security of our hostages was conveyed. The
American authorities assured them that they were applying maximum possible
pressure, in all forms, to secure an early release of the Indian hostages.
In this regard, it may also be recalled that the Prime Minister, Mr. Atal
Bihari Vajpayee had already spoken to President Obasanjo of Nigeria and
has now also written to President Charles Taylor of Liberia, on the ongoing
crisis in Sierra Leone. The MEA representative of the delegation, Mr. Srivastava
who had stayed back at Freetown has been in constant touch with Mrs. Cooper,
the special envoy of President Taylor, to mediate between the ECOWAS team
and RUF. It is also learnt that the ECOWAS team has in consonance with
the stance of the Indian delegation insisted for an unconditional release
of the Indian hostages on priority and de-link it from the proposed cease-fire.
<p>3. The delegation also confirmed that the Force Commander was doing
a commendable job under the difficult circumstances. They also expressed
hope that the hostages will be released soon.

<p>Government of India welcomes the decision of the International court
of Justice in the Aerial Incident case filed by Pakistan against India
regarding&nbsp; the shooting down of a military combat aircraft of Pakistan
(Atlantique) over Indian air space on August 10, 1999, With a decisive
14-2 verdict, the Court has upheld India's submission that it had no jurisdiction
in this matter.
<p>India also welcomes the Court's observations regarding the Simla Agreement
and the Lahore Declaration. Through its comments, the court has vindicated
India's stand on these landmark agreements that are the very cornerstone
of India-Pakistan relations. It is noteworthy that the Simla Agreement
commits both countries to building trust and confidence, putting in place
a stable structure of cooperation and addressing all outstanding issues
through peaceful bilateral discussions.That is what India had sought to
accomplish through the composite dialogue process that was established
at our initiative. That was also the high purpose, for which Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee travelled to Lahore in February, 1999. India stands
committed to dialogue and calls on Pakistan to create the proper environment
for such a dialogue through cessation of cross border terrorism and the
abandonment of hostile propaganda.
