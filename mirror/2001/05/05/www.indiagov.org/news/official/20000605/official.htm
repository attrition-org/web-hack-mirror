<p><b>Visit of Principal Secretary to PM to Kathmandu</b>
<br><b>for the 5th Meeting of the India-Nepal High Level Task Force (HLTF)
from June 6-7, 2000&nbsp;</b></center>

<p>Shri Brajesh Mishra, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, will be
visiting Nepal for the Fifth Meeting of the India-Nepal High Level Task
Force (HLTF) from 6-7 June, 2000. The HLTF, which was set up in 1992, is
chaired by the Principal Secretary to PM on the Indian side and the Chief
Secretary on the Nepalese side. The mandate of the HLTF is to ensure the
successful completion of agreed projects being implemented with Indian
assistance and to recommend new projects which could be taken up under
Indian development aid. The last meeting of the HLTF was held in 1997.&nbsp;
<p>Over the past 3 decades, India has given substantial economic assistance
to Nepal. The initial focus was on infrastructure projects, such as roads,
bridges, irrigation power and airports. Over time the cooperation has also
been extended to other sectors, such as education, health and agriculture.
Indian assistance to Nepal has increased from Rs.11.1 crores in 1980-81
to Rs.76.45 crores in 1997-98.&nbsp;
<p>Two major projects which have been completed over the last year are
the Rs.80 crore B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan and the
Rs.68 crore 22 Bridges Project on the East-West Highway. The BPKIHS has
emerged as the premier medical institute in Eastern Nepal and India will
continue to provide faculty and training support to the Institute till
2009.&nbsp;
<p>The 22 Bridges have been constructed in some of the most difficult terrain
and will provide a continuous Road link on the East-West Highway, which
would be a catalyst for the development of Western Nepal.&nbsp;
<p>Ongoing commitments which are in various stages of implementation include
the Tanakpur-Mahendranagar Link Road, the Raxaul-Sirsiya Rail Link and
the setting up of an Emergency and Trauma Centre at the Bir Hospital, Kathmandu.
In addition there is the regular programme of scholarships for Nepalese
students.&nbsp;
<p>New areas of cooperation which are likely to be discussed at the HLTF
include strengthening of infrastructure along the Indo-Nepal border, cooperation
in water resources, rural development, and human resource development.&nbsp;
<p>The Principal Secretary will call on Prime Minister, G.P. Koirala, Foreign
Minister, Chakra Prasad Bastola and Home Minister, Govind Raj Joshi. He
will also have a special audience with His Majesty, the King of Nepal.
Issues of bilateral interest will be discussed in these meetings.&nbsp;
