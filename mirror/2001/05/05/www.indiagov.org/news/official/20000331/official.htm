<p>In response to a question, the Official Spokesman confirmed that our
High Commissioner to Pakistan had met the Pakistan Foreign Secretary on
29th March. The meeting was held at the request of the Pakistan Foreign
Secretary. During the meeting, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary conveyed
his country's desire to renew dialogue with India and also raised concerns
about India's so called aggressive postures against Pakistan.
<p>India has always sought to establish a relationship of peace, friendship
and cooperation with Pakistan. The India - Pakistan Composite Dialogue
Process was put in place in 1998 at India's initiative. Prime Minister
Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Lahore in February, 1999 to reinforce
India's message of goodwill for Pakistan. Pakistan's Kargil misadventure
constituted not only a violation of the Line of Control, but a transgression
of the territory of trust. The cessation of Pakistan's cross-border terrorism
and the abandonment of its vicious propaganda are essential ingredient,
for any meaningful dialogue. We once again call upon Pakistan to look to
the future, to the welfares of our peoples, and for this purpose, give
up the path of conflict and senseless violence
<p>India has no aggressive designs on Pakistan. Prime Minister Shri Atal
Behari Vajpayee had made this clear when on 21 March, 2000 he said "We
do not think in terms of war, and nobody should think in those terms in
this sub-continent". It is Pakistan, which has, in recent months, intensified
its state sponsored cross-border terrorism in the State of Jammu &amp;
Kashmir. While we will continue to scrupulously maintain our policy of
restraint, we will effectively respond, as we have demonstrated in the
past, to any threat to our territorial integrity.&nbsp;
