<p>Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Hon’ble Minister of State for External Affairs,
will formally inaugurate the new Passport Application Collection Centre
(PACC) at 3.30 p.m. on July 19, 2000 at Pondicherry.&nbsp; Dr. (Smt) Rajani
Rai, Hon’ble Lt. Governor of Pondicherry, will be the Chief Guest at the
function to be held at Raj Niwas and Shri P. Shanmugam, Hon’ble Chief Minister
of Pondicherry, will be the Guest of Honour on the occasion.
<p>&nbsp;The PACC in Pondicherry would work under the Regional Passport
Office, Chennai.&nbsp; The PACC is located in the Animal Husbandry Complex,
Maraimalai Adigal Salai, Pondicherry just a 150 meters away from the Pondicherry
Bus Stand.&nbsp; Applicants from Pondicherry, Karaikkal, Villupuram and
Cuddalore districts can submit passport applications at the PACC.
<p>&nbsp;The PACC would facilitate about 30,000 passport applicants per
year from the area.&nbsp; Applications sent by post, however, have to be
forwarded to the parent office – Regional Passport Office, Chennai only,
as currently, there is no facility to handle postal applications in PACC.
Applications for issue of fresh passports, re-issue of expired passports,
renewal of passports after one year/five years of its issue,
<br>minors' passports, additional booklets, maiden name to married name,
change in name and features, Police Clearance Certificate, ‘Emigration
Check Not Required’ endorsements and other miscellaneous services will
alone be accepted.
<p>&nbsp;Applications for issue of passports under Tatkaal Scheme, duplicate
passports in lieu of lost/damaged passports, official/diplomatic passports
and passports for adopted children will be accepted only in parent office
– Regional passport Office, Chennai.
<p>&nbsp;No cash will be accepted along with application and demand drafts
drawn in favour of Regional Passport Officer, Chennai payable at Chennai
alone will be accepted along with the application.&nbsp; Authorised Travel
Agents have to submit their applications only in RPO, Chennai and the PACC
will not deal with them.&nbsp; Passport prepared against the applications
submitted at the PACC will be despatched to applicants directly from RPO,
Chennai.
<p>&nbsp;On July 20, 2000, the website of RPO, Chennai containing procedures
<br>relating all passport services including application status enquiry
will be launched by Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Hon’ble Minister of State for
External Affairs, at Chennai.
<p>&nbsp;Responding enthusiastically to the call of Minister of State Shri
Ajit Kumar Panja to enter the new millennium with zero pendencies, the
Regional Passport Office, Chennai prepared about 45,000 passports during
last year in November and December against normal output of 12,000 passports
a month and brought down the pendency to zero at the dawn of new millennium.&nbsp;
Today, it takes just about 45 days to issue a fresh passport.&nbsp; RPO,
Chennai has streamlined the procedure for issue of passports and all the
instructions are prominently displayed in the
<br>office for the benefit of public.&nbsp; Special counters for senior
citizens, disabled persons and mothers with infants are under operation.&nbsp;
All Wednesdays are declared as “Grievances Day” and applicants can meet
officers without prior appointment in the afternoon between 2.30 p.m. and
4.30 p.m. to redress their long-pending&nbsp; grievances.&nbsp; A special
facility to get their applications filled in through ex-serviceman has
been arranged in RPO, Chennai for the benefit of illiterate applicants
which will also be extended to PACC, Pondicherry shortly.
