<p>We have learnt with great regret of the brutal killing of the Sri Lankan
Minister for Industrial Development, Mr. C.V. Goonaratne, and of several
other innocent persons today near Colombo.&nbsp; This is an act of terrorism,
an attack on the forces of democracy and a coercive attempt to achieve
political objectives through violence.&nbsp; There is no place for such
acts in a democratic society.&nbsp; The Government of India strongly condemns
this cruel act of terrorism and extends its sympathies to all the bereaved
families as also to the injured.
