<p>The Government of India notes with deep regret the announcement of Syed
Salahuddin from Pakistan that the offer of cease-fire with Indian Security
Forces in Jammu &amp; Kashmir is withdrawn.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;The offer of cease-fire was made in Srinagar on 24 July 2000 by
Majid Dar and received overwhelming support of the people of Jammu and
Kashmir.&nbsp; The Government of India responded to the offer positively
and asked the Home Secretary and other senior officials to begin negotiations
with Hizbul Mujahideen to work out the modalities for the implementation
of the cease-fire.&nbsp; The Home
<br>Secretary and his team flew to Srinagar on 3 August 2000 and held a
meeting with the representatives of Hizbul Mujahideen.&nbsp; Other meetings
were planned for subsequent days.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;It has been evident since 24 July that the cease-fire did not
fit in with Pakistan’s design of aiding and abetting terrorism in Jammu
&amp; Kashmir.&nbsp; Pakistani agencies have put intense pressure on Hizbul
Mujahideen leadership in Pakistan occupied Kashmir to sabotage the cease-fire.&nbsp;
Pakistani agencies also put pressure on the other groups to continue and
intensify acts of violence in Jammu &amp; Kashmir
<br>which led to the massacres of August 1 and 2.&nbsp; Pakistan’s object
has been to derail the peace process by seeking to involve itself as a
party in discussions between India and the Hizbul Mujahideen.&nbsp; The
sabotage of the peace process by Pakistan clearly shows its callous disregard
for the welfare of the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;India remains firmly committed to the peace process and calls
on all those who have taken to arms to return to the path of peace.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;The question of a dialogue with Pakistan is a separate matter.&nbsp;
India is willing to talk with Pakistan on all matters of bilateral concern
when Pakistan puts an end to cross-border terrorism.&nbsp;
