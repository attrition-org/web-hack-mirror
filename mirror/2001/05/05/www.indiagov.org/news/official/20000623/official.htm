<p>The Secretaries in Ministry of Agriculture of India and Nepal today
signed a new Work Plan to continue cooperation in the field of agriculture
between the two countries.&nbsp; This Work Plan was signed at the end of
the three-day visit of a ten-member Nepalese delegation to India to attend
the Fourth Meeting of Joint Agricultural Working Group.&nbsp; The Group
was constituted under the Memorandum of Understanding between the two Governments
signed in 1991.&nbsp; Both sides also agreed to take necessary steps to
extend the validity of the present MOU by another 10
<br>years after its expiry in 2001.
<p>Both sides have agreed to cooperate in implementing the programmes for
watershed based agricultural development in eco-fragile zones of two countries
for increasing the income level of farmers and mitigating the problem of
floods.&nbsp; The two delegations also agreed to enter into a dialogue
to conclude a bilateral agreement on sanitary and
<br>phyto-sanitary measures encompassing plant and animal quarantine and
<br>food safety requirements.
<p>Among other notable achievements of this meeting include agreement on
exchanging information and advanced technologies for upgradation of cash
crops including horticulture and spices.&nbsp; The Indian side also offered
to supply farm machinery and sprinkler/drip irrigation systems on negotiated
commercial terms for agricultural development in Nepal.&nbsp; The Nepalese
side welcomed the Indian offer.
<p>Both sides reiterated the need for eradication of rinderpest and BCCP
diseases and agreed to exchange team of experts to formulate a Plan of
Action in this regard at the earliest.
<p>Under the same MOU, another Work Plan between Indian Council of Agricultural
Research (ICAR) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) is also
in operation simultaneously and a number of programmes have been successfully
implemented under this Work Plan.
