<center><b><font color="#990000">Statement by Shri Jaswant Singh, External
Affairs Minister Recent Incidents at India-Bangladesh Border</font></b></center>
<b><font color="#990000"></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Honourable Members are aware of the grave incidents
on the India-Bangladesh border during 16-19th April, 2001 caused by the
unwarranted and unprovoked intrusion by BDR forces into village of Pyriduwah,
in the East Khasi Hill District of Meghalaya.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Tension thereafter spread to other sectors, including
in Assam where there was heavy exchange of fire between BSF and BDR in
Boraibari on the night of April 17-18. On 18th April morning, one of the
BSF patrol parties went missing. Thereafter, we learnt with concern that
Bangladesh media had reported a statement by the Director General, BDR,
that 16 BSF personnel had been killed in encounter.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The matter was immediately taken up through the
regular channels of the BSF as also through diplomatic channels both in
Delhi and in Dhaka, to convey our grave concern at this unprovoked and
unwarranted intrusion by BDR and calling for immediate cessation of firing,
withdrawal of BDR and restoration of the status quo ante. Confirmation
was received from the Bangladesh Government, the same night (18th April),
that necessary instructions were being issued for withdrawal of the BDR
and restoration of status quo ante. This withdrawal was completed by the
night of 19th April.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">When the bodies of our BSF personnel were returned
on 20th evening, as demanded by us, shocking marks of injury and mutilation,
as also evidence of 8 of them having been shot at point blank range were
found. In the case of Deputy Commanded Mandal, rigor-mortis was just setting
in, indicating that death had occurred within the last 24 hours. The marks
of injury on all bodies were recorded and signed by representatives of
both BSF and BDR.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">A strong protest was lodged with the Government
of Bangladesh at the inhuman treatment of our BSF personnel. We have been
assured by the Bangladeshi Government that all aspects of these incidents
would be investigated, also that the BDR action was taken without their
knowledge and was regrettable. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has spoken
to Prime Minister Vajpayee last night. The Prime Minister conveyed to her
India's deep sense of hurt and anguish over the inhuman treatment meted
out to our BSF personnel. Sheikh Hasina stated that she, too, was deeply
saddened would be carried by these incidents and confirmed that a full
investigation mutilation of the bodies of BSF personnel.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Earlier I had received a call from the Bangladesh
Foreign Minister expressing exactly the same sentiment.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">I would like to reiterate that strong ties strong
ties of friendship exist between the two countries, and acts of criminal
adventurism should not be permitted to affect these ties. It is now upto
the Government of Bangladesh to act against the perpetrators of these crimes
and restore confidence and trust.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The Government of India would like to place on
record admiration for the selfless sacrifice of our brave BSF personnel.
Our hearts go out to their families.</font>
