<center><u><font color="#990000"><font size=+1>India's First Move in Algerian
upstream&nbsp;</font></font></u></center>
<u><font color="#990000"><font size=+1></font></font></u>
<p>On February 21, 2001, India and Algeria signed a Memorandum of Understanding
to study the possibility, within next six months, for the joint development
of Block 242 in the Illizi basin in the South east of Algeria. The MOU
was signed in Algiers by H E Mr. Abdelhak Bouhafs, Chairman Sonatrach and
Mr. Atul Chandra, Managing Director, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL). The signing
ceremony was attended by Indian Ambassador to Algeria Shri Mahesh Sachdev.&nbsp;
<p>If the negotiations prove successful, the project would involve a total
investment of nearly $400 million. Sonatrach is Algerian State owned hydrocarbon
company with an annual turnover of around $20 billion. Although the other
Indian company Engineers India Limited is working with Sonatrach, as a
consultant, since last two decades in downstream activities, the above
agreement would involve an Indian company for the first time in upstream
activities.&nbsp;
<p>Relevant to note that an agreement was signed between OVL and Sonatrach
in November 2000 for the joint bid for developing Tuba oil field in Iraq.
The two companies also signed a separate partnership agreement with M/s
Reliance Industries which operates World's largest oil refinery.&nbsp;
<p>Algeria is the member of OPEC and an important energy source for Europe.
Its gas reserves are ranked among the first 10 worldwide while it accounts
for 1/4th of EU gas imports. Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines H.E.
Mr. Chakib Khelil, is presently the President of OPEC. The partnership
between ONGC and Sonatrach is one of the major achievements of the historic
State visit of the Algerian President to India in January 2001.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="t1"></a><u><font color="#990000"><font size=+1>Statement of
the Prime Minister in both Houses of Parliament regarding Jammu &amp; Kashmir</font></font></u></center>

<p>As Hon'ble Members would recollect, Rashtrapatiji during his address
to the Joint Sitting of both the Houses of Parliament had given voice to
the Government's approach to the whole question of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.
He had then, amongst other things, shared with the Hon'ble Members of Parliament
that :
<p>"The Government is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to bring peace
and normalcy in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. As part of this, it launched a major
peace mission on November 19, 2000, by announcing a unilateral non-initiation
of combat operations in the State during the holy month of Ramzan. This
bold initiative was extended twice up to February 26, 2001. As anticipated,
this was warmly welcomed by the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, who are
longing for an end to militancy and violence in their beautiful State.
The international community has also given overwhelming support, because
it sees in it yet another demostration of India's sincere commitment to
a peaceful and permanent solution to the Kashmir issue."&nbsp;
<p>Rashtrapatij&nbsp; had also then informed the Hon'ble Members that:
<p>"Militancy in Jammu &amp; Kashmir is now increasingly confined to foreign
mercenary groups. This has widened the scope for democratic activity in
the State. The people of the State participated enthusiastically in the
recent Panchayat elections. I reiterate the Government's readiness to have
talk with every group in the State that&nbsp;
<br>abjures violence."
<p>The Govt. has decided to pursue this path by initiating talks with various
groups in J&amp;K.&nbsp;
<p>The Government has seriously addressed the question of continuing with
the peace process and further extending the period of non-initiation of
combat operation by our security forces. In this regard, the Government
has benefited by the detailed briefing of and consultations with all political
parties that it had on February 21, 2001.&nbsp;
<p>Having examined all aspects of the question in its totality, the Government
has decided to further extend the period up till the end of May. Let this
opportunity not be missed by all those that desire peace, for our patience
is not infinite.
<p>I wish to make it abundantly clear that the peace process is only for
those that wish to benefit from it. We will not let this process be derailed,
diluted or misused. For such organizations or elements, as have vowed to
disrupt the peace process, or intend to continue with violence and the
killing of innocents in J&amp;K, my message is unequivocal and clear. If
you inflict injury on any Indian citizen in the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir,
or elsewhere, or commit any act of violence or terrorism then the security
forces have clear instructions to act decisively and to defeat such intentions.
Law and order shall be maintained. Those who think that our security forces
are less determined today to put an end to terrorism are only deluding
themselves.
<p>It is my hope that Pakistan will act, even now, and abjure violence,
give up their continuous hostile propaganda against India, stop promoting
and aiding cross-border terrorism, take the path of peace through bilateral
talks as enshrined in the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, thus
creating a conducive atmosphere so that the composite dialogue process
can be resumed resulting in a lasting solution to the problems.
<p>The process of peace is to enable our citizens in Jammu &amp; Kashmir
to live peacefully. It is their voice that has to be heard, not of the
militants or foreign mercenaries.
<p>Peace is our objective, to peace and dialogue we remain committed because
that, above all, is what the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir need most.&nbsp;
