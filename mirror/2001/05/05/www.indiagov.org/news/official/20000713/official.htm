<br>The Central Passport Organisation (CPO) of the Ministry of External
Affairs has launched an ambitious programme of comprehensive computerisation
of all the 28 Passport Offices.
<p>2. A giant step towards modernisation of India’s passport would be taken
on 13 July 2000 when Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Minister of State, would release
the first Machine-Written-Machine-Readable Passports. These state-of-the-art
passports would have scanned image and photograph of the passport holder
and the present passport with pasted photograph would be gradually phased
out.
<p>3. The Machine-Readable Zone in the Passport would have the personal
particulars of the passport holder in alpha numeric form and this would
make entry and exit at the Immigration Counters quicker across the globe.
<p><b><u>Computerisation of Passport Offices</u></b>
<p>4. 20 of the 28 Passport Offices in the country have already been computerised
by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).&nbsp; All the eight remaining
Passport Offices would be computerised in the next twelve months.
<p>5. The Central Passport Organisation (CPO) has a website:http://passport.nic.in
which was launched on 14th September 1999.&nbsp; The other Passport Offices
would also soon have their own websites where status of the passport application
can be checked.&nbsp;
<p>6. To further streamline the processing procedures at the Passport Offices,
a comprehensive computerisation programme has been approved at the estimated
cost of around Rs.30 crores.&nbsp; The project management has been entrusted
to NIC.
<p>7. The proposed computerisation of Passport Offices would facilitate
the following tasks:&nbsp;
<p>i. An online status Index checking through creation of central index
by
<br>networking all the Passport Offices;
<br>ii. Facility to math photograph for suspect cases;
<br>iii. Efficient planning, monitoring and control of passport issuing
activity;
<br>iv. Future provision to connect POs with Indian Missions abroad to
respond to queries instantaneously.
<p>8. This comprehensive computerisation is to be implemented in the Passport
Offices with seamless integration with the working of the Offices. The
project would, therefore, be implemented in stages which would have the
following components:
<p>i. Transfer of historical data of approx. 1.6 crore passports from Index
Cards to CD-ROMs;
<br>ii. Machine writing of passports with a scanned photograph and signature
of the applicant;
<br>iii. Computer connectivity of all 28 Passport-Offices;
<p>Work on the first two components has already begun in RPO, Delhi. Once
the software, hardware and procedures are tested satisfactorily, these
would be gradually replicated in other Passport Offices starting with Bangalore.
<p><b><u>Vision</u></b>
<p>9. The goal is to set up a modern, transparent and efficient passport
issuing service of which the general public can be genuinely satisfied
and illegalities and irregularities avoided.

<p>The Government of India greets, with a sense of relief, the decision
of Fiji’s Great Council of Chiefs to release Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry
and his Cabinet colleagues from detention in Fiji’s Parliament building
where they have been held hostage since May 19.&nbsp; We expect that this
first step will lead to the restoration of a democratic and constitutional
government within the framework of Fiji’s Constitution of 1997.&nbsp; It
is also our expectation that the Commonwealth’s principles outlined under
the Harare Declaration and the Millbrook Action Programme will continue
to be adhered to.
