<p><font color="#000000">1. A strike notice by the All India Passport Employees
Association (AIPEA) was received by the Ministry on 9 September, 2000.
The Association raised several issues and extensive discussions for more
than 8 hours were held between the office bearers of the Association and
senior officials on Thursday 14 September and Friday 15 September. A response
to all the issues raised by the Association was also formally conveyed
to the Association in the evening of Friday 15 September.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">2. Meanwhile the Association held lunchtime demonstrations
outside the passport offices all over the country on 14 and 15 September
and did not withdraw the strike notice. On Monday, 18 September members
of the AIPEA resorted to agitation and dharna outside the passport offices
and did not perform their duties. However, the officers at all 28 passport
offices attended to their duties.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">3. Due to this, work was affected in most of the
28 passport offices all over the country though some offices functioned
normally.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">4. At RPO, Delhi officers and staff from the Ministry
of External Affairs were deputed to assist in the operations of the office.
Other offices worked on the strength of their officers only while in many
offices some staff members also reported for work.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">5. The Association is unwilling to work with a
private contractor who has introduced the machine writing of passports
at RPO, Delhi. There are some un-founded apprehensions among some passport
staff on working with a private contractor who has been given the work
of machine writing for a limited period only for RPO, Delhi. The staff
has been repeatedly assured that the Government intends to get the machine
writing work done through the officials and staff of the Central Passport
Organisation at all other Passport offices if, after the required training,
the machinery is optimally utilised and the norms of productivity are maintained.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">6. The other issues raised by the Association
pertain to their cadre review, review of the recruitment rules and resolution
of anomalies in their pay scales. On all these issues dialogue has been
held with the Association on several occasions and these are in an advanced
stage of consideration in the Government.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">7. The Government is of the view that when it
is willing to work with the Association for the resolution of their genuine
and reasonable demands, a strike at this stage is neither called for nor
justified since it negates the overall objective of providing prompt support
and efficient services to the people.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">8. The number of passports issued in 1999 was
over 25.8 lakhs from the 28 passport offices in India. The number of passports
issued per annum has gone up even though the staff strength has remained
inadequate. In 1996, there was a staff of 1858 in the CPO cadre, which
grew to 1939 in 1999. In the same time the number of passports issued increased
from 19.12 lakhs in 1996 to 25.8 lakhs in 1999. Thus, while the number
of passports issued grew by almost 34%, the staff strength rose by a mere
4%. Similarly, revenue earned in 1996 by the passport offices in India
was 71.16 crores which grew to 82.2 crores in 1999. This will grow further
since the ‘Tatkaal’ scheme was introduced in January 2000 for which no
additional staff has been added.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">9. All the passport offices are expected to work
normally from Tuesday 19 September 2000.&nbsp;</font>
