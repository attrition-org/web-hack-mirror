<p><font color="#000000">With a land mass almost equal to India, Argentina
is the third largest economy in Latin America (after Brazil and Mexico)
and is by far the largest economic partner of India in the region.&nbsp;
Bilateral trade between the two countries in 1999-2000 reached US$ 565
million, largely in favour of Argentina.&nbsp; However, over the years
India has been able to greatly diversify its range of exports which currently
include motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, garments, machine tools, etc.&nbsp;
A number of</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Argentine companies are also looking into the
possibility of investing in India’s infrastructure development, particularly
the energy sector.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">During his visit Shri Panja will be reviewing
the entire gamut of bilateral and multilateral relations with the Argentine
Foreign Minister, Mr. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini.&nbsp; He would be
also having discussions with the Argentine Health Minister, Dr. Hector
Jose Lombardo, regarding the problem of registration of Indian pharmaceutical
companies in Argentina.&nbsp; The visit will be utilized by MOS (EA) to
explain to the new socialist government of President Fernando De La Rua,
which came into power in Argentina in December last year, India’s position
on numerous issues of common interest and concern including the surge of
cross-border terrorism sponsored by Pakistan.&nbsp; During the visit an
agreement on cooperation between the Foreign Service Institutes of India
and Argentina will also be signed.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">India’s ties with Trinidad &amp; Tobago go back
to the mid-nineteenth century, when the first indentured labourers from
India landed in that country and started working on sugar plantations.&nbsp;
Currently nearly 42% of Trinidad &amp; Tobago’s 1.3 million strong population
is of Indian origin.&nbsp; The two countries have traditionally enjoyed
excellent bilateral relations.&nbsp; Prime Minister Basdeo Panday was the
chief guest in the Republic Day Function in India in 1997.&nbsp; Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid a return visit in February 1999 and
was warmly received.&nbsp; During these two visits the two countries signed
a large number of bilateral cooperation agreements which provide the necessary
framework for cooperation.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">During his visit to Trinidad &amp; Tobago Shri
Panja will be meeting President Arthur Robinson, Prime Minister Basdeo
Panday, Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj and several other dignitaries.&nbsp;
He will be also addressing the Institution of International Relations of
the University of West Indies.</font>
