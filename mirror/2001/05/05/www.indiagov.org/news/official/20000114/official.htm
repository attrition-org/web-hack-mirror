<p>In response to a question, the Ministry of External Affairs made the following comment today in respect of the meeting between Ambassador Zhou Gang of the PRC and Joint Secretary [EA] Shri T.C.A. Rangachari:
<p>"In response to a request made by the Chinese side, we have informed them today that Lama Ugyen Thinley Dorjee, accompanied by six others, arrived in Dharmsala on January 5, 2000.  He and his entourage are currently at a monastery near Dharamsala.  They are in good health.  The Lama is being provided security cover.  The Chinese side has been asked to share with us specific details regarding his departure from Tibet, the route taken and other relevant details.
<p>Both countries India and China have noted with satisfaction the sound momentum in bilateral relations and the process of improvement and development of these relations on the basis of Panchsheel and the concerted efforts of the two countries."

<p>We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing away of veteran ANC activist and former South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo.
<p>He is expected to take up his assignment shortly.
<p>We remember Mr. Nzo as a tireless anti-apartheid campaigner, who was the first ANC representative in India in the 1960s.  His warm and friendly personality won him many friends in this country.  We have also had the pleasure of interacting with him as the first Foreign Minister of the newly-democratic, non-racial South Africa.  We extend our condolences to his family, to his wide circle of friends, and to the political movement of which he remained a committed stalwart to the very end.
