<p>A Passport Application Collection Centre at Tirupati will be inaugurated
by Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Ajit Kumar Panja on 11th
February 2000 at 1130 hours. This Centre would cater to the needs of passport
applicants from four districts of Andhra Pradesh namely Chittoor, Ananthpur
, Cuddapah and Nellore.&nbsp; The passport seekers of these Districts can

Hyderabad through post.&nbsp; This is the second Collection Centre under
Regional Passport Office, Hyderabad, the first being at Vijaywada.
<p>The Regional Passport Office, Hyderabad had brought the pendency of
passports to " Zero" as it entered the new millenium . All the passport
applications submitted upto November 15, 1999 were processed and passports
were issued before 31 December 1999 if the documents were complete and
the police report was clear. This was accomplished as a concerted drive
was launched in all the 28 Passport Offices to clear the backlog and as
a result 25.8 lakh passports were issued in 1999 throughout the country
marking an increase of 16% over the output in 1998.&nbsp;
