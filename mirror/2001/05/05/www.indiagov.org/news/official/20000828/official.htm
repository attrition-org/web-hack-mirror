<br><font color="#000000">In response to a question the official spokesman
confirmed that over the last five years, Pakistan had on completely baseless
and untenable charges, sought the recall to India of 17 members of our
High Commission in Islamabad.&nbsp; The official spokesman also confirmed
that 89 cases of intimidation, harassment, abduction and physical torture
of our High Commission officials by the Pakistani agencies were intimated
to the Pakistan Foreign Office during the same period.&nbsp; In all these
cases the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the India-Pakistan
Code of Conduct for the Treatment of Diplomatic Personnel of August, 1992,
were grossly violated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personnel of our High Commission and
their family members are routinely subjected to intensive and intrusive
surveillance and harassment by the Pakistan agencies.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The official spokesman also focussed attention
on the callous approach of Pakistan towards its humanitarian and diplomatic
obligations as is being witnessed currently in its failing to grant consular
access to the shipwrecked crew of an Indian cargo vessel, Jan Kallyan,
which had caught fire and sank on June 25, 2000, in the Arabian Sea on
a journey from UAE to India.&nbsp; Eleven crew members of the vessel were
rescued by a Pakistani fishing boat on June 30, 2000.&nbsp; These crew
members had spent nine days in the sea without food and water.&nbsp; Pakistan
informed us about</font>
<br><font color="#000000">the rescue of these crew members on July 6, 2000.&nbsp;
It also conveyed that some of the Indian crew members who were in need
of medical treatment had been admitted to the government hospital in Pasni
(Pakistan).&nbsp; The Government of India immediately conveyed its ‘deep
appreciation to the Government of Pakistan and, through them, to the crew
members of the Pakistani fishing boat involved in the rescue of the eleven
crew members of the Indian boat ‘Jan Kalyan’.&nbsp; In keeping with international
practice, the High Commission of India sought immediate consular access
to the crew members in order to ascertain their welfare and to arrange
for their repatriation to India.&nbsp; Consular access has not been accorded
as yet by the Government of Pakistan.&nbsp; The agony and suffering of
the crew members as well as that of their families in India is, therefore,
being inexplicably prolonged.&nbsp; The continued detention of the crew
members in Pakistani custody and the denial, as yet, of consular access
displays an inhumane attitude.</font><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
