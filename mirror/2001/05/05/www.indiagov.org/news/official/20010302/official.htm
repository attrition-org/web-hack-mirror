<br><b><font color="#990000">External Affairs Minister, Shri Jaswant Singh's
Statement in Parliament on March 2, 2001</font></b>
<p>In the face of universal concern and despite protests and cautions against
taking any such step, the Taliban appear bent upon committing a grave wrong,
indeed, a sacrilege to humanity, to the civilisational and cultural inheritance
of all mankind by wanting to destroy the incomparable and unique statues
of Buddha at Bamiyan. It is tragic that this act of vandalism, the most
extreme amongst the many other acts of destruction of statues, artifacts
and archaeological treasures of Afghanistan is being pursued despite a
global outcry against it.
<p>This regression into medieval barbarism is precisely what India, amongst
many other countries, has been cautioning the world against for so long.
The international community has unequivocally condemned and rejected the
Taliban's ideological orientations which have been responsible for the
Taliban territories emerging as the world's principal centre of international
terrorism, illicit drugs and violation of human rights, especially those
of women.&nbsp;
<p>Even at this late stage, we would like to convey that the destruction
of these precious manifestations of the cultural heritage of humankind
should stop. If the Taliban do not wish to retain this inheritance, India
would be happy to arrange for the transfer of all these artifacts to India
where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind, in the full
knowledge and clear understanding that they are, in the first place and
above all, treasures of the Afghan people themselves.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="t1"></a><b><font color="#990000">Launch of Passport Application
Sale and Collection through Speed Post&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#990000">Centres</font></b>
<p>In the continuing drive to improve the delivery of passport services
to the public the Ministry of External Affairs and the Department of Posts
have come together in a common endeavor to enhance the accessibility of
passport services.
<p>From 5th March 2001 speed post centres in 47 locations in different
cities will start&nbsp; accepting completed application forms. These centres
would also provide&nbsp; application forms for new passports to the public.
These 47 centres will augment the&nbsp; existing 28 passport offices and
the 21 Passport Application Collection Centres and&nbsp; at one stroke
will nearly double the number of places where people can deposit their&nbsp;
filled application forms in the country. Processing and dispatch of passports
will be done by the passports offices as at present.
<p>This new facility will be inaugurated by the Hon'ble Shri Ram Vilas
Paswan, Minister&nbsp; for Communications and Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Minister
of State for External&nbsp; Affairs at New Delhi on March 5, 2001 at 11.30
AM.
<p>With this new initiative the distance to be traveled by applicants for
obtaining an&nbsp; application form or submitting it for a passport will
be reduced in large population&nbsp; centres. In. the next phase 57 additional
speed post centres would be enabled to&nbsp; accept application forms as
well thus increasing the out reach of passport services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
considerably.&nbsp;
<p>The collaboration with the Department of Posts already includes delivery
of&nbsp; passports through speed post services. In this way applicants
submitting completed&nbsp; application papers at a speed post centre near
their homes will get a passport&nbsp; delivered at home and would not have
to visit the passport office at all if they so&nbsp; choose.
<p>As the computerisation of passport offices is progressing several passport
offices&nbsp; already have their own websites which would allow a status
check on the passport&nbsp; applications. This network would gradually
cater to all the 20 computerised passport&nbsp; offices. Tele-enquiry services
at the passport offices are also being revamped. With&nbsp; these services
in place people would not have to necessarily go to passport offices&nbsp;
to enquire about the status of processing of. their passport applications.
<p>In this exercise, the availability of forms submission of applications
and the delivery&nbsp; of passports would be effectively decentralized
while the processing, which is a&nbsp; specialised field and requires considerable
expertise, data base and hardware, will&nbsp; remain centralised in the
28 passport offices. These services are also being augmented through an
expansion of machine writing of passports project, the creation of data
bases for old passports and the establishment of connectivity between passport
offices for easier communication and cross checking.&nbsp;
<p>The present cooperation between the Department of Posts and the Ministry
of External Affairs will see these Joint services start at Tiruvanthapuram,
Kollam, Thiruvalla, Kottyam, Kochi, Alwaye, Thrissur and Kozhikode in Kerala;
<p>at Bangalore, Mangalore, Udipi, Hubli, Dharwad, Belgaum, Bellary and
Gulbaroa in&nbsp; Karnataka;&nbsp;
<p>at Mumbai GPO, and Andheri in Mumbai; at Navrangpura, Pindi, Bazar,
Ahmedabad SPC and Ahmedabad GPO in Ahmedabad;&nbsp;
<p>at Kolkata GPO, Bidhan Nagar, Kolkata and Siliguri in West Bengal;&nbsp;
<p>at SPC New Delhi, New Delhi HO, Delhi GPO, Lodhi Road HPO, Krishna Nagar
HO, Ashok Vihar HO, Delhi GPO, Indraprastha HO, Ramesh Nagar HO and&nbsp;
Sarojini Nagar HO in Delhi;
<p>at Hyderabad GPO, Secunderabad HO, Khairatabad, Hyderabad Jubilee HO
and Humayun Nagar in Andhra Pradesh;&nbsp;
<p>at SP Business office, IIT PO, Vadaplani PO, Anna Nagar PO, Tirplicane
PO and Anna Road HPO in Chennai.
<p>It is the endeavor of the Government to gradually passport application
receiving facilities at the district level in every district of India thus
reducing the necessity of&nbsp; travel by the growing member of passport
applicants to the passport offices. 22.43 lakh passports were issued in
the year 2000 reflecting the growing requirement for extending the passport
services througliout the country and bring these services closer to the
people.&nbsp;

<p><font color="#000000">Today, in this new millennium, when all civilizations
are coming together through dialogue and shared values, we are shocked
by the <i>Taliban </i>announcements of intended acts of religious fundamentalism
and terrorism against human culture and civilization. They have moved tanks
and guns to destroy one of the greatest examples of human creativity. This
intent of destroying the two thousand year old statues of Buddha and the
Buddhist shrines in <i>Bamiyan </i>would constitute an appalling act of
cultural vandalism.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">This House unanimously condemns the barbarism

possible terms. We hope the world community and especially the United Nations
will take note of this and prevail upon the Taliban regime in Afghanistan
to desist from this senseless, destructive act.</font>

<br>The Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has written
to the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Thailand,
Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, U.S.A., U.K., France, Russia and China and the
U.N. Secretary-General about the reported decree of the Taliban leaders
in Afghanistan to destroy all statues in that country including the ancient
Bamiyan Buddhas, describing this order as a "disquieting development".
<p>The Prime Minister added that the reported decree "represents a further
obscurantist regression - an assault on centuries of Afghan tradition and
upon an irreplaceable civilisational inheritance of all mankind. We are
disturbed to see reports that this demolition is already in progress".&nbsp;
<p>Prime Minister Vajpayee urged that "the collective voice of humanity
be raised against this outrage, and that the Taliban be made to see reason".
He also urged that "we should also take up this matter with those countries
that have influence with the Taliban, so that they, too, could intervene
to seek the withdrawal of the decree".&nbsp;
