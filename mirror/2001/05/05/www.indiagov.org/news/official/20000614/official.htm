<p>In response to questions regarding Mr. Nawaz Sharif’s recent statements
to the Pakistani media on Pakistan’s aggression in Kargil last year, the
official spokesman said that Mr. Nawaz Sharif’s statements only reconfirm
what has been known all along that the Pakistan army had planned this misadventure,
that it were Pakistan’s regular troops and not so called mujaheddin that
had been sent across the Line of Control in the Kargil Sector.&nbsp;
<p>The second, and more worrisome aspect is that of deceptions, more particularly
and tellingly, against the Armed Forces and the people of Pakistan themselves
by the present regime attempting to perpetuate the untenable myth of so
called mujaheddin, of not disclosing the actual casualties suffered by
Pakistan's military units themselves, thus denying them the elementary
right of trust and honour which is due of all military forces anywhere
in the world.&nbsp;
