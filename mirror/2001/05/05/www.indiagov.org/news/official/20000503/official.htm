<center><b>The External Affairs Minister, Shri Jaswant Singh&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>made following statement at 1945 hours today</b></center>

<p>The Government of&nbsp; India is monitoring the situation in northern
Sri Lanka closely. The Government of Sri Lanka has been in touch with the
Government of India on the evolving situation.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government of India will be guided in its response
to developments by its continued commitment to a peaceful resolution of
the conflict within the framework of a united Sri Lanka, where all communities
can realise their aspirations.&nbsp;
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India will work to mitigate the hardship inflicted
upon civilians by the conflict, taking such humanitarian measures as become
necessary, in consultation with Sri Lanka. India is already host to over
100,000 Sri Lankan refugees.&nbsp;
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is India's hope that the peace sought by all Sri Lankans
will soon return to a country that is a close and friendly neighbour. India
is ready to contribute to making that hope a reality.
