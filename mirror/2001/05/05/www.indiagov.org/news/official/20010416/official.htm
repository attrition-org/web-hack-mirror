<p><a NAME="t1"></a><b><font color="#990000">The Ministry of External Affairs
along with the Indian Institute of Public Adminstration (IIPA), New Delhi
is organising a training programme from 16 to 20 April, 2001 for the officers
of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO)</font></b>, who manned the 28
passport offices all over the country. The training programme is a major
institutionalised step towards human resource development. The title of
the programme is "Managing Orgainsational effectiveness in regional passport
offices".
<p>2. The training programme will be inaugurated by the Minister of State
for External Affairs, Shri U.V. Krishnam Raju, at 1000 hrs on April 16,
2001.
<p>3. The delivery of efficient passport services is the prime objective
of the Ministry and the Central Passport Organisation. A series of initiatives
have been undertaken to modernise the rendering of passport services in
the country and to make this process user-friendly. These include extensive
computerisation, machine writing of passports and decentralisation of the
acceptance of passport application forms to bring the service closer to
the door steps of the applicant.
<p>4. In any service oriented organisation the human element is of paramount
importance. The Central Passport Organisation will be assessed and judged
by the public opinion on the basis of its efficacy, promptness and its
ability to deal with people in a courteous manner. Focussed attention is,
therefore, being given to human resource development and training for officials
and staff of the Central Passport Organisation.
<p>5. This 5-day programme, which is being inaugurated on 16 April, 2001
focuses on motivation, time management, behavioural aspects, public relations
etc. It would give the passport personnel an opportunity of appreciating
new methods of job design and provide ideas for improving productivity.
It would also strengthen appreciation, among the personnel, of the technology
of passport processing and other recent innovations made in the central
Passport Organisation.
<p>6. This training programme has been possible as a result of the partnership
established between the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Institute
of Public Administration, New Delhi. The vision is to ensure that any visitor
to the passport office returns satisfied and the CPO personnel give service
with a smile.
