<p><tt><u>Text of the Statement made by the Spokesman on the rescheduling
of External Affairs Minister Shri Jaswant Singh's visit to Saudi Arabia</u></tt></center>

<p>At the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the kingdom of
Saudi Arabia the official visit to the External Affairs, Shri Jaswant Singh
is being rescheduled . This is owing to the involvement of the Foreign
Minister of Saudi Arabia in the diplomatic efforts currently underway to
diffuse the situation in the Middle East and move it towards normalcy.
<p>A number of Foreign Ministers of neighbouring countries are already
in Riyadh to prepare for a summit there on October 16, 2000 of the leaders
of Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt . This is prior to the full fledged Arab
Summit scheduled to be held in Egypt later this month. The pace of developments
in the West Asian region which necessitated these summits, impacted on
a visit to which both sides attach high importance and for which they had
undertaken meticulous preparations.
<p>The authorities of Saudi Arabia have expressed their deep regrets about
the inconvenience that this may have caused and have expressed their keen
desires to reschedule the visit in the very near future keeping in mind
developments in the region and the mutual convenience of the two Foreign
Ministers
