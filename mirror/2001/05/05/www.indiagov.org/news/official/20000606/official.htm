(1999).&nbsp;
<p>The&nbsp; Summit level group for South-South consultation and cooperation
known as the the G-15, came into existence during the Ninth Non-Aligned
Summit in
<br>Belgrade in September 1989. The intention was to create a functional
and compact group of developing countries that could focus on South-South
economic
<br>cooperation supported by political engagement at the&nbsp; the highest
level. The setting up of the G-15 coincides with the beginning of what
is, in retrospect, a clairvoyant
<br>response to the challenges and opportunities that have since&nbsp;
been posed to developing&nbsp; countries.&nbsp;
<p>The Vice President will return to Delhi on 21<sup>st</sup> June, 2000.&nbsp;

<hr WIDTH="50%">
<p>The Government of India is deeply disturbed about reports of a coup
in the Solomon Islands yesterday and the kidnapping of the Prime Minister
and Governor General by armed militants attempting to seize power by force.
<p>We strongly condemn such illegal activity against legitimate governments
anywhere, whether in the Solomon Islands or Fiji.
<p>The Government of India calls upon the international community, and
in particular the Commonwealth, to protect the fundamental political values
enshrined in the Harare Declaration and the Millbrook Action Programme
and to act in a concerted way to restore the legitimate government in both
countries.
