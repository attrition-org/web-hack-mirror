<br>In a brilliantly planned and executed military operation, nicknamed
Operation "Khukri", during the last 36 hours, 221 UNAMSIL troops (mainly
from India) and 11 UNAMSIL Military Observers from various other countries,
who were in stand off at Kailahun in Sierra Leone for more than 10 weeks
(since 02 May), were extricated from Kailahun to Daru.&nbsp;
<p>2. Extensive diplomatic efforts by the UN and India, and political initiatives
at the highest level to persuade the RUF to lift the siege having been
unsuccessful and peaceful means having been exhausted, <b><i>the use of
force to secure the freedom of movement of UNAMSIL Peacekeepers and Observers
had become unavoidable. </i></b>The 'go ahead' for the military option
was given by the UN Secretary General Mr. Kofi Annan and the UN Department
of Peacekeeping Operations.
<p>3. The Military Operations supervised personally by Maj. Gen. V.K. Jetley,
UYSM from Daru commenced at 0600 hours on 15 July 2000, for which the preparations
and build up had been completed earlier.
<p>4. The operation was a complex one which involved:
<blockquote>a) Securing a link-up between our columns from Daru and Kailahun
at a mid-way place in area Pendembu.
<br>b) The total distance is approximately 72 kms. and in this area, RUF
had over 1000 rebels and in the area of Pendembu, was their Brigade Headquarters.</blockquote>
5. The operation was planned in two phases:&nbsp;
<blockquote>a) Phase 1 (13-14 July) Preparatory Phase</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>i) To establish an Air and logistics base at Kenema.
<br>ii) Build up reserves i.e., 18 Grenadiers, at Daru.</blockquote>
b) Phase 2 (15-16 July) Execution of Plan
<blockquote>i) Commenced 0600 h (Sierra Leone time) on 15 July&nbsp;
<br>ii) Involved dropping heliborne troops at three places to get control
of Road Daru-Kailahun. These places are - Kenema, Geihun and Three Bridges
Area. Approximately 300 troops were helidropped by our Air Force helicopters.
The returning helicopters also picked up Military Observers and certain
troops in their flights.
<br>iii) Also involved our Attack Helicopters engaging in RUF positions
at Pendembu-Kailahun-Manowa Ferry besides some other places
<br>iv) Composite Columns of Mechanised Vehicles (BMPs) and Infantry, commenced
simultaneous move from both directions of Kailahun and Daru at the same
time.
<br>v) 'RUF' put up resistance as best as they could but because of three
factors, operations proceeded smoothly and rapidly:
<blockquote>aa) Surprise and speed
<br>ab) Good orchestration of operations
<br>ac) Extensive air cover by our Air Force helicopters</blockquote>
vi) By evening 4pm, Pendembu was attacked by our troops from the South
and captured by 6pm and link-up effected.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
6. There was a small supporting operation by a Ghana Company along with
our BMPs, between Kenema and Daru at 'Sregbara'. It cleared one road block.
<p>7. It is assessed that by the evening, our troops will be safely back
at Daru. We had two cases of shrapnel injuries to the commando, who were
immediately evacuated and provided medical assistance. They are fine.
<p>8. The Force Commander, Maj. Gen. Vijay Jetley, had located himself
at Daru for the operations and repeatedly flew over the operational area,
to monitor the progress of the operations.
<p>9. The UNAMSIL operation was basically carried out by the Indian troops
who were:
<p><b><u>Indian Troops</u></b>
<blockquote>i) 18 Grenadiers and 5/8 GR, approximately 1100 personnel
<br>ii) Special Forces (Para Commandos) - one team
<br>iii) Mechanised Infantry elements
<br>iv) Air Force - 3x Attack Helicopters, 3x MI-8 and 4x Cheetah Helicopters</blockquote>
<b><u>Other UN Troops</u></b>
<blockquote>i) Nigeria - 2x Companies - kept as reserves at Daru
<br>ii) Ghana - 1x Company
<br>iii) UK - 2x Chinook Helicopters (did only one sortie)
<br>iv) Sierra Leone Government - MI-26 helicopters (flew up to Daru only)</blockquote>
11. In this operation, RUF have taken heavy losses and own forces have
recovered one MMG, eight LMGs, seven rocket launchers and one truck load
of ammunition abandoned by the RUF at Pendembu. In addition, two of our
one Ton vehicles, earlier taken away by RUF have also been recovered. As
part of the effective Air operations, own Attack Helicopters destroyed
three RUF vehicles carrying their reinforcements at Manowa Ferry.
<p>12. These operations prove the mettle of the Indian soldiers, who have
done the country proud!
