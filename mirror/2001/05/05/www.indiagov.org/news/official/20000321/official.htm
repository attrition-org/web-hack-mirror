<p><a NAME="vision"></a><font size=+1>India - US Relations: A Vision for
the 21st Century</font></center>

<p>At the dawn of a new century, Prime Minister Vajpayee and President
Clinton resolve to create a closer and qualitatively new relationship between
India and the United States.
<p>We are two of the world's largest democracies. We are nations forged
from many traditions and faiths, proving year after year that diversity
is our strength. From vastly different origins and experiences, we have
come to the same conclusions: that freedom and democracy are the strongest
bases for both peace and prosperity, and that they are universal aspirations,
constrained neither by culture nor levels of economic development.
<p>There have been times in the past when our relationship drifted without
a steady course. As we now look towards the future, we are convinced that
it is time to chart a new and purposeful direction in our relationship.
<p>Globalisation is erasing boundaries and building networks between nations
and peoples, economies and cultures. The world is increasingly coming together
around the democratic ideals India and the United States have long championed
and lived by.
<p>Together, we represent a fifth of the world's people, more than a quarter
of the world's economy. We have built creative, entrepreneurial societies.
We are leaders in the information age. The currents of commerce and culture
that link our societies run strong and deep. In many ways, the character
of the 21st century world will depend on the success of our co-operation
for peace, prosperity, democracy and freedom.
<p>That presents us with an opportunity, but also a profound responsibility
to work together. Our partnership of shared ideals leads us to seek a natural
partnership of shared endeavours.
<p>In the new century, India and the United States will be partners in
peace, with a common interest in and complementary responsibility for ensuring
regional and international security. We will engage in regular consultations
on, and work together and with others for, strategic stability in Asia
and beyond. We will bolster joint efforts to counter terrorism and meet
other challenges to regional peace. We will strengthen the international
security system, including in the United Nations and support the United
Nations in its peacekeeping efforts. We acknowledge that tensions in South
Asia can only be resolved by the nations of South Asia. India is committed
to enhancing cooperation, peace and stability in the region.
<p>India and the United States share a commitment to reducing and ultimately
eliminating nuclear weapons, but we have not always agreed on how to reach
this common goal. The United States believes India should forgo nuclear
weapons. India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum nuclear
deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its security needs. Nonetheless,
India and the US are prepared to work together to prevent the proliferation
of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, we will persist
with and build upon the productive bilateral dialogue already underway.
<p>We reaffirm our respective voluntary commitment to forgo further nuclear
explosive tests. We will work together and with others for an early commencement
of negotiations on a treaty to end the production of fissile materials
for nuclear weapons. We have both shown strong commitment to export controls,
and will continue to strengthen them. We will work together to prevent
the spread of dangerous technologies. We are committed to build confidence
and reduce the chances of miscalculation. We will pursue our security needs
in a restrained and responsible manner and will not engage in nuclear and
missile arms races. We will seek to narrow our differences and increase
mutual understanding on non-proliferation and security issues. This will
help us to realise the full potential of Indo-US relations and contribute
significantly to regional and global security.
<p>The true measure of our strength lies in the ability of our people to
shape their destiny and to realise their aspirations for a better life.
That is why the United States and India are and will be allies in the cause
of democracy. We will share our experience in nurturing and strengthening
democratic institutions the world over and fighting the challenge to democratic
order from forces such as terrorism. We will co-operate with others to
launch an international Community of Democracies this year.
<p>The United States applauds India's success in opening its economy, its
achievements in science and technology, its commitment to a new wave of
economic expansion and reform, and its determination to bring the benefits
of economic growth to all its people. Our nations pledge to reduce impediments
to bilateral trade and investment and to expand commerce between us, especially
in the emerging knowledge-based industries and high-technology areas.
<p>We will work together to preserve stability and growth in the global
economy as well. And we will join in an unrelenting battle against poverty
in the world, so that the promise of a new economy is felt everywhere and
no nation is left behind. That is among the fundamental challenges of our
time. Opening trade and resisting protectionism are the best means for
meeting it. We support an open, equitable and transparent rule-based multilateral
trading system, and we will work together to strengthen it. We agree that
developed countries should embrace policies that offer developing countries
the opportunities to grow, because growth is the key to rising incomes
and rising standards. At the same time, we share the conviction that human
development also requires empowerment of people and availability of basic
freedoms.
<p>As leaders in the forefront of the new high-technology economy, we recognise
that countries can achieve robust economic growth while protecting the
environment and taking action to combat climate change. We will do our
part to meet the global environmental challenges, including climate change
and the impacts of air and water pollution on human health.
<p>We also pledge a common effort to battle the infectious diseases that
kill people and retard progress in so many countries. India is at the forefront
of the global effort that has brought us to the threshold of the eradication
of polio. With leadership, joint research and application of modern science,
we can and will do the same for the leading killers of our time, including
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
<p>We are proud of the co-operation between Indians and Americans in advancing
frontiers of knowledge. But even as we unravel the mysteries of time and
space, we must continue to apply our knowledge to older challenges: eradicating
human suffering, disease and poverty. In the past, our co-operation helped
ease mass hunger in the world. In the future, it will focus as well on
the development of clean energy, health and education.
<p>Our partnership is not an end in itself, but a means to all these ends.
And it is reinforced by the ties of scholarship, commerce, and increasingly
of kinship among our people. The industry, enterprise and cultural contributions
of Americans of Indian heritage have enriched and enlivened both our societies.
<p>Today, we pledge to deepen the Indian-American partnership in tangible
ways, always seeking to reconcile our differences through dialogue and
engagement, always seizing opportunities to advance the countless interests
we have in common. As a first step, President Clinton has invited Prime
Minister Vajpayee to visit Washington at a mutually convenient opportunity,
and the Prime Minister has accepted that invitation. Henceforth, the President
of the United States and the Prime Minister of India should meet regularly
to institutionalise our dialogue. We have also agreed on and separately
outlined an architecture of additional high-level consultations, and of
joint working groups, across the broad spectrum of areas in which we are
determined to institutionalise our enhanced cooperation. And we will encourage
even stronger people-to-people ties.
<p>For India and the United States, this is a day of new beginnings. We
have before us for the first time in 50 years the possibility to realise
the full potential of our relationship. We will work to seize that chance,
for our benefit and for all those with whom we share this increasingly
interdependent world.

<p><a NAME="insttl"></a><font size=+1>Institutional Dialogue Between India
and the United States</font>
<p>1. During the visit of President Clinton to Delhi in March 2000, Prime
Minister Vajpayee and President Clinton agreed as part of their vision
for the future relationship that a regular, wide-ranging dialogue is important
for achieving the goal of establishing closer and multifaceted relations
between India and the United States and for the two countries to work jointly
for promotion of peace and prosperity in the 21st century. The two leaders
agreed on a number of steps to intensify and institutionalise the dialogue
between India and the United States.
<p>2. The Prime Minister of India and the President of the United States
will hold regular <b>bilateral 'Summits'</b> in alternating capitals or
elsewhere, including on the occasions of multilateral meetings, to review
the bilateral relations and consult on international developments and issues.
They will remain in frequent contact on telephone and through letters.
<p>3. The two countries will also hold an <b>Annual Foreign Policy Dialogue</b>
at the level of the External Affairs Minister of India and the Secretary
of State of the United States. This dialogue will be broad-based and touch
upon all aspects of India-US relations, including considering the work
of other groups as appropriate.
<p>4. The two countries also consider the ongoing <b>Dialogue on Security
and Non-proliferation</b> between the External Affairs Minister of India
and the Deputy Secretary of State of the United States important for improving
mutual understanding on bilateral, regional and international security
matters. They agreed that this dialogue should continue and take place
semi-annually or as often as considered desirable by both sides. The Principals
of this dialogue will establish Expert Groups on specific issues as considered
desirable and appropriate.
<p>5. <b>Foreign Office Consultations</b> between the Foreign Secretary
of India and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs of the
United States will continue. The two leaders believe that close co-operation
between the two countries is a factor of stability in the politically and
culturally diverse and rapidly transforming Asia. A <b>Dialogue on Asian
Security</b> will also be conducted as part of the Foreign Office Consultations.
The two sides will also stay in close touch and consult on international
democracy initiatives.
<p>6. The two leaders consider combating international terrorism as one
of the most important global challenges. They expressed satisfaction at
the establishment of the <b>Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism</b>
and its productive first meeting in February 2000. They agree that the
Joint Working Group should continue to meet regularly and become an effective
mechanism for the two countries to share information and intensify their
co-operation in combating terrorism.
<p>7. The two leaders see an enormous potential for enhancement of economic
and business relations between the two countries in the Knowledge Age.
They decided to <b>institutionalise bilateral economic dialogue</b>. They
will keep themselves informed and follow developments in the bilateral
economic dialogue closely through a high-level co-ordinating group. The
co-ordinating group will be led on the Indian side by Prime Minister's
Office with the support of Ministry of External Affairs and, on the US
side by the White House with the support of the State Department.
<ul>
<li>
The <b>Co-ordinating Group</b> will develop a common economic agenda for
and undertake preparations for the Heads of Government meetings. With broad
inter-agency and inter-ministerial representations at senior official level,
it would convene regularly to facilitate close co-ordination on the various
issues raised in the ministerial dialogues and ensure that discussions
therein complement and reinforce broad economic and foreign policy objectives,
including the deepening of bilateral co-operation on high technology and
information technology issues.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Indo-US Financial and Economic Forum</b>: The Indian Minister of Finance
and the US Secretary of the Treasury and will host a forum on finance and
investment issues, macroeconomic policy and international economic developments
at regular intervals. Their meetings at ministerial level would be supplemented
by sub-Cabinet meetings and involve, as appropriate, the participation
of Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Council of Economic
Advisors, and other officials of the US Government and the Securities and
Exchange Board of India, Reserve Bank of India and other officials of Government
of India.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Indo-US Commercial Dialogue</b>: The Minister of Commerce and Industry
of India and the US Secretary of Commerce will lead a dialogue to deepen
ties between the Indian and American business communities. The dialogue
will encompass regular government-to-government meetings to be held in
conjunction with private sector meetings. Its aim will be to (a) facilitate
trade (b) maximise investment opportunities across a broad range of economic
sectors, including information technology, infrastructure, biotechnology,
and services. Participation will include, as appropriate, representatives
of other Cabinet agencies and Ministries on both sides. Close contact will
be maintained with business associations, and activities will be planned
with the benefit of such private sector input, including the establishment
of subcommittees to pursue specific projects or sectoral issues of mutual
interest.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Indo-US Working Group on Trade</b>: The Ministry of Commerce and other
concerned Ministries/Departments of Government of India and the United
States Trade Representative will engage in regular discussion to enhance
cooperation on trade policy. As appropriate, individual trade issues could
be examined in greater depth with the participation of other agencies with
corresponding responsibilities and through creation of sub-groups. The
Group will serve as a locus of consultation on a broad range of trade-related
issues, including those pertaining to the World Trade Organisation. The
Group will receive inputs from the private sector (including trade policy
issues identified in the Indo-US Commercial Dialogue) as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
8. The two leaders consider co-operation between the two countries in energy
and environment an important part of their vision for the future. They
have agreed to set up a <b>Joint Consultative Group on Clean Energy and
Environment</b>. The Group will hold periodic ministerial/high level meetings
as desirable and appropriate and will lay emphases on collaborative projects,
developing and deploying clean energy technologies, public and private
sector investment and co-operation, and climate change and other environmental
issues. The Co-conveners of the Group will be the Ministry of External
Affairs of India and the Department of State of the United States.
<p>9. The two leaders believe that the strong scientific resources of the
two countries provide excellent opportunities for scientific collaboration
between them. They agree to set up an <b>India-US Science and Technology
Forum</b>. The Forum shall promote research and development, the transfer
of technology, the creation of a comprehensive electronic reference source
for Indo-US science and technology cooperation, and the electronic exchange
and dissemination of information on Indo-US science and technology cooperation,
and other programmes consistent with the previous practice of the US-India
Foundation.
<p>10. Institutional dialogue in other areas will be considered as mutually
agreed.
