<br><font color="#000000">Serious incidents of harassment and intimidation
of our High Commission personnel and their families by Pakistani agencies
had taken place during the past few days.&nbsp; The spokesman drew attention
in particular to an incident which had taken place on September 2, 2000
involving an attempt at molestation of minor daughters of staff members
of the High Commission by an intruder who had entered the compound of the
house of one of the High Commission’s staff members.&nbsp; The staff member
and his&nbsp; wife had gone to a hospital.&nbsp; His daughters aged 8 and
6 and the 7 year old daughter of another staff member who lives in the
same area were playing the driveway of the house.&nbsp; At around 5 p.m.
an intruder entered the compound and took two of the girls to one corner
of the garden and attempted to physically misbehave with them.&nbsp; The
girls resisted and ran inside the house.&nbsp; At this stage, the intruder
left the house.&nbsp; The girls informed the staff member and his wife
of the incident when they returned home.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The spokesman said there is little room to doubt
that the intelligence officials of Pakistan, who were keeping a surveillance
over the house did nothing to prevent the incident.&nbsp; It also appears
that the intruder not only had the knowledge of the absence of the staff
member and his wife but was also sure that they would not return home early.&nbsp;
The role of the Pakistani intelligence officials was therefore extremely</font>
<br><font color="#000000">questionable.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The spokesman confirmed that an FIR about this
heinous crime was lodged by the High Commission with the local police authorities.&nbsp;
The Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner was summoned to the Ministry of External
Affairs yesterday.&nbsp; He was informed that the Government of India took
the gravest view of this incident.&nbsp; Further, that the Government of
India expected that the perpetrator of this heinous crime, irrespective
of his identity, be arrested, prosecuted and punished according to law.
The same demand was conveyed to the Pakistan Foreign Secretary by our</font>
<br><font color="#000000">High Commissioner in Islamabad during the course
of a meeting today. Pakistan Foreign Secretary and the Deputy High Commissioner
expressed regret over this reprehensible act and said that the Pakistan
authorities will carry out a full investigation of the incident.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In another incident on September 3, 2000 a staff
member and his family were proceeding by car from Islamabad to Taxila when
they were stopped at a Police Check Post, questioned and taken to a Police
Station where they were detained for 40 minutes.&nbsp; The spokesman also
recalled that the residential premises of two senior Indian Diplomats were
intruded upon by the operatives of the Pakistan intelligence agencies on
August 30, 2000.&nbsp; These high handed actions of the Pakistan authorities
were in complete violation of the Vienna Convention and the Bilateral Code
of</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Conduct for the Treatment of Diplomatic Personnel.
Government have lodged strong protests against these actions of the Pakistan
authorities.</font>
