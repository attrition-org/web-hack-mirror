<p>In response to a query, the Official Spokesman said:

<p>	Our attention has been drawn to reports of the recognition of 'Chechnya as an independent State' by the Taliban authorities.

<p>	India is a victim of extremism and cross border terrorism. The Government and people of India have expressed their full solidarity with the Government and people of the Russian Federation as they tackle the grave crisis confronting them in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation. The Government of India fully supports the Government of the Russian Federation in the steps taken by it in the protection of its Constitutional order and territorial integrity and does not welcome encouragement to forces, which undermine this.

<p>	Both India and the Russian Federation have committed themselves to take joint action against aggressive nationalism, religious and political extremism, terrorism and separatism. At the same time, it is the responsibility of the international community to take steps to eradicate this menace confronting us in the new millennium to enable us to make the world a safer and stable place for humankind.
