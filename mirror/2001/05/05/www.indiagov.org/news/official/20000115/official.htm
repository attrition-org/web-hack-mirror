<p><center><b>Official Spokesman's Statement</b></center></p>
<p>In connection with the recent hijacking of Indian Airlines flight
IC-814, India today drew the attention of Pakistan to the latter’s legal
obligations under the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of
Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation of 1971, the Hague
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft of 1970
and the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, to all of
which Pakistan is a party.
<p>The Pakistan High Commissioner, Mr. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, was
summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs today by the Foreign
Secretary and informed that the Government of India had jurisdiction
over the offences committed by the hijackers and their accomplices.  He
was reminded that Pakistan also had legal obligations, under the Simla
Agreement of 1972, to prevent the organization, assistance or
encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peaceful and
harmonious relations and also to prevent hostile propaganda.  He was
told that support to acts of terrorism, including the hijacking of the
Indian Airlines aircraft and subsequent anti-India public statements by
the released terrorist, Masood Azhar, who was in Pakistan, were in
contravention of Pakistan's obligations under the Simla Agreement.
<p>The Pakistan High Commissioner was also told that the terrorists,
whose release was secured by the hijackers by threatening the lives of
the hostages and killing one of them, had since made their appearance in
Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.  Given that a large number of
terrorists whose release was sought by the hijackers are Pakistani
nationals and that the first destination chosen by the hijackers was
Lahore, there was strong ground to believe that the hijackers were
currently in Pakistan.  Accordingly, Pakistan, as a State party to the
above Conventions, had the clear legal obligation to take them into
custody and extradite them to India.
<p>It was also made clear to the Pakistan High Commissioner that the
Government of India expected Pakistan to take the necessary measures to
apprehend the hijackers and their accomplices present in Pakistan, to
extradite them to India for prosecution in fulfilment of its obligations
under the  international conventions mentioned above, to co-operate in
connection with criminal proceedings against the offenders and to report
to the International Civil Aviation Organisation all relevant
information in its possession regarding the hijacking and the action
taken against the offenders.
<p>He was also informed that the Government of India reserved the right
to take further measures as appropriate.
<p>The UNGA has adopted  by consensus the Declaration on Measures to
Eliminate International Terrorism, in which it has categorically
affirmed that acts of terrorism for political purposes are in any
circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political,
philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other
nature that may be invoked to justify them.  The Declaration has also
asked States to refrain from organising, instigating, facilitating,
financing, encouraging or tolerating terrorist activities and take
appropriate practical measures to ensure that their respective
territories are not used for terrorist installations or training camps
or for the preparation or organisation of terrorist acts intended to be
committed against other States or their citizens.
<p>Growing international consensus against terrorism is also reflected
in the resolution 1269 adopted by the UN Security Council on 18th
October, 1999, which unequivocally condemned and called upon States to
prevent and suppress terrorist acts.
