<p>Minister of External Affairs of India Mr. Jaswant Singh and Deputy Secretary
of State of the United States of America Mr. Strobe Talbott met in London
on January 18-19, 2000 to continue the on-going Indo-U.S. dialogue on security,
non-proliferation, disarmament and related issues. They also discussed
bilateral relations, regional developments and security, the recent hijacking
of Indian Airlines Flight 814, counter-terrorism and other global issues.
Mindful of the goal of crafting a multifaceted partnership, they also discussed
the possibility of institutionalizing their dialogue. Senior level officials
from their respective governments joined Minister Singh and Secretary Talbott.&nbsp;
<p>The talks were conducted in the positive and constructive manner that
has characterized their continuing dialogue. The two sides agreed to establish
a Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism, which will hold its first meeting
in Washington in early February. They agreed to work together to ensure
that the perpetrators of the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 were
brought to justice, as part of their joint efforts to combat international
terrorism. The two sides also discussed arrangements to plan in detail
for the proposed visit to India by President Clinton. Minister Singh and
Secretary Talbott agreed on the need to intensify and broaden Indo-American
discussions and looked forward to further meetings.
<p><b>New Delhi,</b>
<br><b>January 19, 2000.</b>

<p>The Government of India have categorically and unequivocally rejected
the allegations that have been made by the Government of Pakistan against
Mr. P. Moses, a member of the High Commission of India in Islamabad. The
Deputy High Commisioner of Pakistan in New Delhi was summoned to the Ministry
of External Affairs today and told that these allegations were as fanciful
and far-fetched as the so-called evidence in their support was concocted
and baseless. It was pointed out to him that Pakistan's actions were part
of its propaganda campaign directed at covering its own involvement in
cross-border terrorism and blurring its own track record.&nbsp;
<p>The Ministry again strongly condemned the abhorrent behaviour of the
Pakistani authorities in extracting so-called confessions under duress
from Mr. P. Moses, threatening his personal safety and that of his wife
and family, subjecting him to physical and mental ill-treatment and parading
him in front of the media. These actions are contrary to all norms and
conventions of diplomatic interaction, especially those contained in the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Bilateral code of Conduct
between India and Pakistan on the Treatment of Diplomatic and consular
Personnel.&nbsp;
<p>The Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner was informed that the Ministry
deplored the fact that the Pakistan Government did not consider it necessary
to inform the High Commission of India in Islamabad even after the identity
of Mr. Moses had been established and that the Pakistan police refused
to register an FIR as was sought to be done by the High Commission. Absurd
allegations were made of Mr. Moses wanting to hand over obviously planted
items to an unidentified person. The fact that Mr. Moses was not even questioned
about this person or his alleged accomplices in the High Commission indicates
that the charges by the Pakistani authorities were spurious and the entire
event was a transparent frame-up. It was obvious that this was yet another
incident in the pattern of harassment and intimidation by Pakistani authorities
against members of the Indian High Commission and was grossly violative
of its international and bilateral obligations.&nbsp;
<p>The Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner was told that it was ironical
that Pakistan, a state known to be sponsoring international terrorism was
seeking to make baseless allegations about India. He was reminded of the
concerns that had been expressed publicly by the Government of India regarding
Pakistan's role as a state sponsor of terrorism in India in the State of
Jammu &amp; Kashmir and elsewhere. These concerns had been expressed on
numerous occasions to the government of Pakistan. During the talks held
between the Home Secretary of India and the Interior Secretary of Pakistan
in New Delhi on November 12, 1998, the Government of India had handed over
extensive evidence to Pakistan, which pointed to the existence of a vast
infrastructure on Pakistani territory for the purpose of recruiting, indoctrinating,
training, arming, financing and infiltrating terrorists into India. All
these actions are carried out with the full knowledge and complicity of
the Government and other official agencies of Pakistan. The Pakistan Deputy
High Commissioner was told that the Government of India strongly condemned
such policies and demanded that action be taken to dismantle the entire
infrastructure that exists on Pakistani territory for this purpose.
<p>The Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner was also reminded of the note
that had been handed over on January 15, 2000 to the High Commissioner
of Pakistan, wherein Pakistan was requested to honour its international
obligations and apprehend and extradite the hijackers of the Indian Airlines
aircraft IC-814 as also their accomplices, all of whom are believed to
be in Pakistan. He was told that the Ministry would appreciate the cooperation
of the Government of Pakistan in all the matters mentioned above.&nbsp;

<p>Mr. Akbar Zeb, the Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan was summoned
to the Ministry of External Affairs in the afternoon. He was informed that
Mr. Shabbir Hussain Shah, a staff member of the Pakistan High Commission
in New Delhi, had been indulging in activities incompatible with his official
status. The Government of India have, accordingly, sought Mr. Shah's withdrawal
from India by January 26, 2000.
