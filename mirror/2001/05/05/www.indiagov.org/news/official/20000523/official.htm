<p>Prime Minister Vajpayee today received a group of relatives of the
Prime Minister of Fiji Mr. Mahendra Chaudhry.    They expressed concern
at the situation in Fiji and, in particular the fate of Prime Minister
Chaudhry, who is being held at gun point together with some other
members of the Fiji Government in an attempted coup d’etat, since
Friday, May 19.  Prime Minister Chaudhry’s relatives conveyed their deep
anxiety about his physical safety and well being and sought PM’s help to
ensure the Fiji Prime Minister’s early release from detention.

<p>     PM conveyed his deep disquiet regarding recent developments in
Fiji.  He reiterated his view that any move to oust the legitimately
elected Government in Fiji would be unacceptable to India.  He said that
India condemned the undemocratic and criminal nature of the events that
have occurred in Fiji.  He also expressed surprise that the coup leaders
appear to enjoy police protection and freedom of action in Suva.  They
are in violation of the principles of the Harare Declaration and the
Millbrook Action Programme of the Commonwealth.  PM directed EAM Shri
Jaswant Singh to take up the matter urgently with the Commonwealth
Secretary General and the British Government.

<p>     Concerted international pressure is necessary in order to restore
the legitimate government in Fiji.  India is ready to play its part.
Disruption of inter-racial harmony and loss of property since the coup
attempt is a matter of concern and it is hoped that the crisis can be
rapidly brought to an end with the restoration of the legitimately
elected government.
