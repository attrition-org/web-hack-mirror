<p><b>Background Information</b></center>

<p>In October 1999, the UN Security Council mandated the establishment
of the UN Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), by Resolution 1270
of 22 October 1999. This followed the signing of Lome Peace Agreement in
July 1999, between the Government of Sierra Leone on the one hand, and
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the Civil Defence Forces, former
Sierra Leone Armed Forces/Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and
all other armed groups in Sierra Leone, on the other. The present authorised
strength of military personnel in UNAMSIL is 13000, including 260 Military
Observers. India has contributed two battalions and support elements to
UNAMSIL. The Force Commander of UNAMSIL is Major General V.K. Jetley of
the Indian Army. The Indian contingent of 3147, including 214 Air Force
personnel of the aviation unit, is the second largest after Nigeria, which
has 3226 troops. One of the Indian battalions is mostly deployed in the
Eastern provinces of Daru, Kailahun and Kenema.
<p>2. The RUF, the major rebel force in Eastern part of Sierra Leone, began
reneging on commitments undertaken under the Lome Accord. RUF leader, Foday
Sankoh and his chief advisers went underground on May 8 and the Sierra
Leone Army arrested them on May 17.&nbsp;
<p>3. On May 3, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) took more than 500
UNAMSIL Peacekeepers as hostages. This also included 12 Indians. All the
hostages, including the 12 Indians, were released by the end of May as
a result of diplomatic pressure. About the same time, the RUF mounted a
siege and restricted the freedom of movement of 232 UNAMSIL personnel (222+11)
at Kailahun. Simultaneously, the RUF also encircled a group of 21 UNAMSIL
Peacekeepers (all Indians) in Kuiwa; they were later disarmed and in early
June were moved to Pendembu. All these troops were released on June 29
after intense political and diplomatic pressure was brought to bear by
both India and the UN.
<p>4. Both the UN and India have engaged in extensive diplomatic efforts
to persuade the RUF to lift the siege on the Indian Peacekeepers and Military
Observers at Kailahun. The United Nations shared with us the assessment
that diplomatic options having been exhausted, use of force to lift the
siege and to secure freedom of movement of UNAMSIL Peacekeepers and Observers,
had become unavoidable.
<p>5. The current mandate of UNAMSIL permits the use of force.
<p>6. We have been informed by the UN authorities that acting under this
mandate provided by the UN Security Council Resolution No. 1270, UNAMSIL,
has launched military operations this morning at approximately 0600 hrs.,
Sierra Leone time, (1130 hrs. IST) to lift the siege at Kailahun. Information
has been received that 40 Peacekeepers and Observers have, when last reports
came in, already been evacuated. UNAMSIL troops have begun advancing on
the ground from Daru towards Kailahun. So far, no armed resistance from
the RUF has been encountered.
<p>7. For this UNAMSIL operation, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations
is providing the command and control structure. The Indian authorities
are regularly being kept informed. The safety and security if Indian troops
involved in this UN operation remains of paramount concern to the Government.
