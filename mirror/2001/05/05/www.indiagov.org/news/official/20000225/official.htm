<p><b>The 2nd ASEAN - India Food Festival</b></center>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs of India and the ASEAN New Delhi Committee
(ANDC), which comprises the 10 ASEAN Diplomatic Missions, are pleased to
announce that the 2nd ASEAN-India Food Festival will be held from 27 February
to 4 March 2000 at the Maurya Sheraton Hotel &amp;Towers in New Delhi. The
Minister of External Affairs, H.E. Mr. Jaswant Singh, has kindly consented
to inaugurate the Festival at a function on 26 February 2000 hosted by
the ANDC. The Festival will highlight the warm relations between ASEAN
and India and the continuation of cooperation coming soon after the recent
visit of the Heads of States/Governments of several ASEAN countries, namely
H.E. President Tran Duc Luong of Vietnam, H.E. Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong of Singapore, H.E. President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia, and H.E.
Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen of Cambodia.
<p>ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations - comprising Brunei, Darussalam,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, The Philippines, Thailand,
Singapore, and Vietnam) and India established a Sectoral Dialogue Partnership
in 1993, which was elevated to a Full Dialogue Partnership in 1995, with
the purpose of enhancing the multi-faceted cooperation between India and
ASEAN. During the First ASEAN-Joint Consultative Committee Meeting held
in New Delhi in 1996, it was agreed to implement activities, which would
enhance people-to-people interaction between the two sides. As a result,
the First ASEAN-India Food Festival was held in New Delhi in February 1998
with the support of the ASEAN-India Fund, and was deemed a great success
in profiling the close cultural linkages between the peoples of India and
Southeast Asia.
<p>This will be the first time that the food from 10 ASEAN countries, alongside
with India, will be presented and thus bring out an authentic "taste of
ASEAN" to India. The food will be prepared by Chefs from ASEAN countries.
Other ASEAN - India activities which are currently in the pipeline include
official level talks such as the ASEAN-India Senior Officials Meeting and
the 3rd Asian-India Joint Consultative Committee, and other functional
activities such as the "ASEAN-India Lecture Series".
