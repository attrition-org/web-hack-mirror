<p><b><u>Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, 2000</u></b></center>

<p>The first batch of the Yatris of Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, 2000, which
left New Delhi on June 2, is presently at Gunji. They were to cross Lipulekh
Pass into Tibet on June 10 but could not proceed further from Gunji on
June 8, 2000 due to continuing rains in the region. The Yatris will proceed
further as soon as weather conditions permit. All the Yatris of the first
batch are safe and in good health.
<p>The second batch of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra departed from New
Delhi for Kathgodam on June 8, 2000. The batch will be reaching Bageshwar
tonight, as scheduled.&nbsp;
<p>The third batch of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra will report in New
Delhi on June 13, 2000 as scheduled.

<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="50%">
<p>Two officers, one JCO and 18 other ranks of the Indian Battalion earlier
confined to a RUF brigade headquarters in Pendembu pending their re-joining
their unit have last evening been made hostage and also disarmed.&nbsp;
Simultaneously, the RUF leadership has now made a set of demands to the
UNAMSIL.&nbsp; This is entirely unacceptable.&nbsp; Soon after this development,
the government conveyed its very serious concern to the UN Secretary General
who has assured that the immediate release of these Indian troops is the
highest priority for the UN as this is a challenge to the UN itself.<b></b>
