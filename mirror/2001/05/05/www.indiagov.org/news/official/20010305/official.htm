the cessation of cross-border terrorism.&nbsp;
<p>7. Both sides affirmed their conviction that in democratic and open
societies, there could be no justification whatsoever for violence and
resort to terror against civilian population. Such acts must be replaced
by reasoned discourse. In this context, they recognized that the global
menace of terrorism, which today flourishes in conjunction with narco-trafficking
as well as the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, must be combated
vigorously by the entire international community. Both sides agreed to
work together for the early adoption of a Comprehensive Convention against
International Terrorism which has been proposed by India at the UN as well

for which Colombia is a candidate for Chairmanship later this year.&nbsp;

regional entities of Latin America such as the Rio Group and the Andean
Community.&nbsp;

and recalled their long-standing cooperation in NAM, which both countries

the G-15 since last year. Both sides agreed to work in concert with other
G-15 developing- country partners to evolve successful models of south-south
cooperation as well as for harmonization of their views in the critical
areas of trade, finance, investment and technology.&nbsp;
<p>10. The President of Colombia and the Prime Minister of India agreed
that the reform and democratization of the UN to provide for more equitable
participation and representation of developing countries reflecting current
realities must be pursued on a priority basis. India welcomed Colombia's
membership of the UN Security Council for the period 2001-02. Colombia
recognized India's legitimate aspirations to a permanent seat in a reformed
and expanded UN Security Council as well as India's important role in regional
and world affairs.&nbsp;
<p>11.Both sides welcomed the significant expansion of bilateral commercial
and economic relations during 2000 and recognized that there was considerable
potential for the further enhancement of these relations. They expressed
the hope that the Reciprocal Export Credit Agreement concluded during the
visit would provide new impetus to bilateral trade, investment and joint
ventures. In this context, they also reaffirmed their interest in concluding
a Preferential Trade Agreement and a Bilateral Investment Protection Agreement.&nbsp;

business delegation and leaders of Indian business and industry, promising
areas for strategic partnerships, including in the areas of textiles, pharmaceuticals,

of the India for the warm hospitality extended to his delegation and to
himself by the Government of India. He invited the President and the Prime
Minister of the Republic of India to pay state visits to Colombia. The
inivitations were accepted with pleasure, with dates to be decided through
diplomatic channnels.
<p>16. Both sides expressed their conviction that the state visit of the
