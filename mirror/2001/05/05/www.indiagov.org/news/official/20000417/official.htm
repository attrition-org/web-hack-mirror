<p>The Parliamentary Consultative Committee meeting of the Ministry of
External&nbsp; (MEA) met under the chairmanship of External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh, on April 17, 2000 to discuss “International Terrorism with
a focus on cross-border terrorism in Kashmir" In opening the meeting, Shri
Jaswant Singh said that the problem of international terrorism including
cross-border terrorism is an issue of high security to India. Countering
this problem involves a coordinated and holistic approach involving different
departments and ministries of the government. The&nbsp; Ministry of External
Affairs, particularly after Kargil is pegged very high in its hierarchy
of priorities. The MEA have attempted, considerable success, raising international
recognition and awareness of the need to tackle the menace of' terrorism.
Cross-border terrorism is a challenge to the&nbsp; State of India&nbsp;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its approach to terrorism, the Government
of India proceeds from the premise that this is one of the most serious,
pervasive and pernicious threats to civilised&nbsp; societies and to international
peace and security. For two decades, India has been a victim of state sponsored
terrorist violence, aided and abetted from across the border. Indiscriminate
violence has claimed the&nbsp; lives of innocent men and women, including
eminent citizens belonging to public life, media,&nbsp; judiciary, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Terrorist have tried to disrupt normal democratic processes, destroy the
socio-economic fabric of Indian life and undermine the basic and inalienable
rights of citizens, such as right to life, right to freedom , right to
movement, right to elect people's representatives, etc. The challenge before
India is to maintain an open, democratic, transparent and pluralistic -
society, safeguard individual rights, and, at time, combat the scourge
of terrorism&nbsp;&nbsp; through all possible means. Today terrorism has
gone global and has linkages with illicit trade in drugs, arms and money&nbsp;
laundering all over the world. In recent&nbsp; years, the world&nbsp; has
witnessed the emergence of certain states as a source of international
terrorism consequently as a destabilizing factor in the maintenance of
regional peace and international peace and security. Global terrorism requires
to be combated and&nbsp; defeated by organized collective international
action.&nbsp;
<p>3. India’s approach to international co-operation in the field of terrorism
has been guided by its own experience with cross-border terrorism and the
principle of&nbsp; "extradite or prosecute". India is a party to a number
of international conventions. India has also circulated a draft of a comprehensive
convention against terrorism at the&nbsp; UNGA in 1996. The objective of
the proposed convention is to serve as an umbrella instrument that would
bring together all earlier international conventions on terrorism adopted
so for under one rubric. The need for a comprehensive convention has arisen
in order to cover other aspects of terrorism, which have not been dealt
with by existing conventions. These include a special focus on cross-border
terrorism the need to adequately address the problem of state- terrorism.
India also believes that a legally adopted convention would provide clarity
and help avoid a situation where action to counter is perceived as unilateral.
The proposed convention will complement, existing legal instruments. A
universal and comprehensive conventions would&nbsp; also obviate the need
for concluding separate regional and bilateral treaties through an often
lengthy and tedious process.&nbsp;
<p>4.&nbsp; India like many other democracies - Germany, France, Italy,
UK and USA - has adopted measures, including legislative, to deal with
the threat of terrorism while at the same time ensuring that the human
rights are not violated during the fight against terrorism and when abuses
occur, they are swiftly dealt with .
<p>5. During discussions, Hon’ble Members of Parliament offered valuable
observations and suggestions how to address the problem of terrorism. Some
of these are encapsulated as follows :
<p>-The Government of India, particularly the Ministry of External Affairs,
should&nbsp; be complimented for helping to build international consciousness
about terrorism.
<p>-Pakistan has been using the label of Jehad to justify terrorism as
well as to divert the attention of its own&nbsp; citizens and the world
public opinion from its own&nbsp; economic and social problems. It was
important to make this known widely to erode any vestiges of support to
Pakistan's cause.&nbsp;
<p>It was important to make it known to everybody that terrorism does not
pay.
<p>-India should make special efforts in the Islamic world to create further
awareness that Pakistan's terrorist activities do not constitute jehad
but have a subversive goal directed against India and that visits should
be organised to these&nbsp; countries to explain India's case.&nbsp;
<p>-Greater publicity needs to be undertaken in and abroad about the activities
of Pakistani agencies in fostering terrorism.&nbsp;
<p>-Steps should be taken to ensure that acts of terrorism find no excuse
under the garb of&nbsp; self-determination or national liberation.&nbsp;
<p>-While dealing with terrorism in the country, care should be taken about
the protection of human rights,&nbsp;
<p>-The Government of India should monitor the activities of Pakistani
agencies and examine whether there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is any nexus
between the terrorism in Kashmir in the North-East.&nbsp;
<p>- Steps should be taken to prevent the dissemination of material in
India that maligns the country and disturbs communal harmony and social
peace in the country.&nbsp;
<p>- Creating International awareness against terrorism requires the active
support of members of Parliament, through parliamentary level contacts
with foreign countries.
<p>- It should&nbsp; be recognized&nbsp; that the problem of international
terrorism and narcotics trafficking are&nbsp; inter- linked.
<p>- In its approach to Pakistan, the Government of India should bear in
mind of a dialogue with Pakistan&nbsp; at an appropriate time.&nbsp;
<p>6.&nbsp; The External Affairs Minister thanked the Members for their
valuable observations and suggestions. He fully supported proposals for
greater parliamentary contacts. He recalled his visits to Oman and Abu
Dhabi as well as the visit of the Minister of State for External Affairs
to Tunisia, Sudan and Egypt. He noted that India recently played host to
the President&nbsp; of Indonesia, the Prime Minister of Morocco and Deputy
Foreign&nbsp; Ministers of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and others as part of
its overall diplomatic engagement. He sald that the government was alive
to the need for&nbsp; human fights even as we counter the scourge of terrorism.
<p>The Government of&nbsp; India does not accept jehad as an instrument
of foreign policy of any country; this approach has found great resonance
in the international community; The EAM also emphasised the need for additional
meetings&nbsp; of the Committee on the critical issue of countering terrorism.
