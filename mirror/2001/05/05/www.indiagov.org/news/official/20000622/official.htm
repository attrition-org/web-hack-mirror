<p>1. Prime Minister will be visiting Italy and Portugal from 25 to 30 June,
2000.  In Italy he will be accompanied by the Finance Minister.  Prime
Minister will hold talks with Prime Minister Amato and attend a Business
Meeting organised by Confindustria and FICCI.  He will also meet
President Ciampi in Rome.

<p>2.    Prime Minister’s visit to Italy will be the first Head of
State/Head of Government level visit exchanged between the two countries
since that of Mr. Romano Prodi, the Prime Minister of Italy to India in
January, 1998.  Italy is an important interlocutor for India, both
politically and economically.  It is a significant trading partner and
also an important investor in India.  The political dialogue between the
two countries has been strengthened in recent months with the visit of
the External Affairs Minister to Rome in January, 2000 and that of Mr.
Franco Danieli, Italian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to India
in March-April, 2000.

<p>3.    Prime Minister will subsequently visit Portugal from 27 to 29 May,
2000 for the first-ever India-EU Summit and for a bilateral visit.  The
Summit will be held on 28 June.  The EU side will be represented by Mr.
Antonio Guterres, Prime Minister of Portugal and Mr. Romano Prodi,
President of the European Commission.  Prime Minister will be
accompanied by the External Affairs Minister, the Finance Minister, the
Minister of Commerce and Industry and the Minister for Information
Technology.  It is expected that a Joint Declaration will be issued at
the conclusion of the Summit.  The Declaration will serve as a broad
vision statement of India-EU relations and provide a blue-print for
upgrading the relationship to a qualitatively higher level.  The Summit
will also finalise an Agenda for Action which will encompass joint
initiatives in the political and economic fields.  The India-EU Summit
will be preceded by an India-EU Business Meeting organised by CII and
the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 27 June, 2000.  About
30 representative Indian companies and over 200 of European ones are
expected to participate in this meeting.  The Prime Minister will be
accompanied by the Finance Minister, the Commerce and Industry Minister
and the Minister for Information Technology.

<p>4.    Prime Minister will also pay a bilateral visit to Portugal from 28
to 29 June 2000 at the invitation of Mr. Antonio Guterres, Prime
Minister of Portugal.  He will hold talks with Prime Minister Guterres
and President Jorge Sampaio.

<p>5.    Prime Minister’s visit to Portugal will further consolidate the
friendly relations which exist between the two countries.  The President
had visited Portugal in September, 1998.  This has been followed by the
visits of Mr. Jose Lello, Portuguese Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs to India in February, 2000 and of the External Affairs Minister
to Portugal in March-April, 2000.  The close understanding which exists
between the two countries is reflected in the fact that the first-ever
India-EU Summit takes place during the Portuguese Presidency of the
European Union.
