<p><b>Visit of Hon'ble Ranil Wickremesinghe, M.P., Leader of the</b>
<br><b>opposition, Sri Lanka to Delhi</b></center>

<p>1. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, M.P. Leader of the United National Party
and Leader of the Opposition in Sri Lanka, visited Delhi from April 18-21,
2000. He was accompanied by Mrs.&nbsp; Wickremesinghe and two advisers.&nbsp;
<p>2. During his stay in Delhi, Mr. Wickremesinghe called on the Prime
Minister, the Home Minister, the Minister of External Affairs, the Minister
for Human Resource Development, the Minister for Commerce &amp; Industry
and the Minister of State for External Affairs. Mr. Wickremesinghe's visit
to India was in continuation&nbsp; of the practice of maintenance of contact
between the Government of India and political leaders in Sri Lanka. He
last visited India in April 1998.&nbsp;
<p>3. In his discussions, Mr. Wickremesinghe reiterated his keen interest
in and support for the strengthening of relations between India and Sri
Lanka, particularly in the economic sector. Mr. Wickremesinghe apprised
the Indian leadership of progress in the resolution of the ethnic conflict
in Sri Lanka, including the UNP's talks with the Sri Lankan Government
on the devolution package and role being played by Norway as a facilitator.&nbsp;
<p>4. India's relations with&nbsp; Sri Lanka are close, cooperative and
friendly. These have been marked by regular high level contacts in increasing
spirit of mutual understanding. India's position on the ethnic conflict
in Sri Lanka has been consistent and well-known. India supports a peaceful,
political settlement within the framework of Sri Lanka's unity, sovereignty
and territorial integrity. India believes that this is an internal matter
for Sri Lanka, which would be best resolved by the Sri Lankans themselves.
