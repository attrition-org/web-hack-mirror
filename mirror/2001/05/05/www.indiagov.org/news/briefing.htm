<p><b><font color="#990000">Forthcoming visit of Foreign Secretary Smt.
Chokila&nbsp; Iyer to Bhutan:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Foreign Secretary, Smt. Chokila Iyer wiil be paying
an official visit to Bhutan from May 7-9, 2001. This would be her first
visit abroad after assuming the charge of Foreign Secretary. The visit
is part of ongoing regular bilateral consultations between the two countries
on issues of mutual interest. In 2000 the then Foreign Secretary Shri Lalit
Mansingh had visited Bhutan in March and then in December.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">India and Bhutan have very close and problem free
relations. The relations are further sustained by regular visits and extensive
exchange of views at official level and at the highest level. India has
a very extensive cooperation and development assistance programme with
Bhutan encompassing various sectors with special focus on infrastructure
and the social sectors. Our cooperation in the hydel sector has been mutually
beneficial, providing&nbsp; resources for Bhutan's development and power
for India. The 336 MW&nbsp; Chukha hydroelectric project, commissioned
in 1988, is functioning well. India is also extending assistance to Bhutan
for the construction of Kurichu Hydroelectric Project (60 MW) and Tala
Hydroelectric Project 1020 MW. The first out of the four units of Kurichu
Project was commissioned last month. The Tala project is expected to be
commissioned by 2004-2005. Some new projects which could be taken up for
joint development are under discussion.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Both sides share concern on the presence of ULFA-Bodo
militants in Bhutan. In July 1999 the National Assembly of Bhutan passed
a resolution authorising the government to engage in a dialogue to persuade
the militants and take action under the National Security Act against those
found to be maintaining links with the militants. In July 2000 the National
Assembly adopted another Resolution, reiterating the decision of July 1999
but also authorising the Government to use force to expel the militants,
if other options failed. Both Governmens remain in consultation with each
other on how best to address this problem.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<a NAME="t1"></a><b><font color="#990000">In response to questions, the
Spokesperson said the following:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Asked whether the Ministry of External Affairs Statement
marked a shift from its earlier objections to Washington's National Missile
Defence (NMD) the spokesperson said that the Statement speaks for itself.
India welcomes the announcement of unilateral reduction of nuclear forces
by the US, as an example. India also welcomes moving away from the hair-trigger
alerts associated with the prevailing nuclear orthodoxies. India notes
with appreciation that the US seeks dialogue, consultation and cooperation
with the country concerned towards fulfillment of this vision. India believes
that there is a strategic and technological inevitability in stepping away
from a world that is held hostage by the doctrine of MAD to a cooperative,
defensive transition that is underpinned by further cuts and a de-alert
of nuclear forces. India has always stood for a multilateral compact that
results in an&nbsp;&nbsp; elimination of all nuclear weapons globally.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Asked to comment about abrogation of the Anti-Ballistic
Missiles (ABM) treaty and its security implications, the Spokesperson said
that the ABM treaty is a bilateral treaty between the US and the Russian
Federation. He added that India is not for any unilateral decision but
for consultations and cooperative action. The Spokesperson recalled the
comments of the Russian Federation Foreign Minister Mr. Igor Ivanov saying
that Russia has welcomed the Bush' statement and that the US and Russia
should work together to develop a new foundation for world security in
the 21st&nbsp; century. Hoping that this would create the prerequisites
for constructive dialogue and consultation on the issues of strategic stability
in the interests of Russia and US and in the interests of the entire world.
Mr. Ivanov also pointed out that Russia's idea on deep cuts in nuclear
arsenals is in harmony with the approach of the US administration. Mr.
Ivanov added that It is principally important that the US President has
underlined that his administration does not intend to take unilateral steps
or to put on the table already prepared variants, but is planning to consult
with its allies, friends, with other States, including with Russia to take
into account their opinion at the time of taking decisions.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Asked why India was so enthusiastic about the US
National Defence Policy the Spokesperson said that we had responded to
a highly significant and far reaching statement by the Bush administration.
It dwelt on the broader issues of transforming the strategic parameters
on which the Cold War security architecture was built. He added that it
is going to have a much larger global impact and will have bearing on international
security. India had specially welcomed elements that are already articles
of our long standing policy such as deep reductions, moving away from hair-trigger
alert, international action towards elimination of nuclear weapons and
a coordinated and consultative transition to a new security paradigm.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Asked about the agenda for discussions between Mr.
Ivanov and Shri Jaswant Singh the Spokesperson said that India and Russia
have long standing time tested relations and will discuss the full gamut
of bilateral,&nbsp; regional and international issues. The content of Indo-Russian
relations encompasses political and security dialogue, trade and economic
relations, science and technology, defence cooperation and cultural contacts.
This content is constantly enriched with new elements. We look forward
warmly to the visit of Foreign Minister Mr. Igor Ivanov.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Asked about the UNGA report on the situation in Afghanistan
the Spokesperson said that the report while describing the situation in
Afghanistan made reference to the recent visit of Prime Minister Shri Atal
Bihari Vajpayee to Iran. It also drew reference to the Indo-Russian Joint
Working Group on Afghanistan and the visit of the UN Secretary General
Personal Representative on&nbsp; Afghanistan Mr. Frances Vendrell to India.</font></li>
