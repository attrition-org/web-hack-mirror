<center>It has been quite some time since the media been able to seriously milk a hacking epidem
ic
such as this one going on now. Web page defacements have been going on since upwards of 1995, or
 at
least documented since
then and they are a booming business right now for the media. Such media moguls as CNN, time mag
azine,
and ABC have all bit their share off of the china u.s. hacker war. They have taken what is going
 on and
twisted it into a false reality that they can share with the general public to cower in the shad
ow of
the allmighty hacking force that drives the U.S. But when is there a time to say no to the media
even though it is not physical is destroying security-type persons lives. From the smallest admin that
gets fired and has to go home to tell his wife that he was fired, to the hacker that gets raided for
wiretapping and international espionage charges, they all carry the same effect.  People are sitting
glued to their televisions watch "live and late-breaking" coverage of the supposed war and are having a
blast scaring themselves after years of contamination to lies. The media has destroyed peoples lives
before and they will do it again as long as they can make money off of the exploitation of humanbeings. Hacking as we know it has taken an immortal plummet to the depths of hell. People are
forgetting the true essence of the activity and going out and defacing a couple high profile pages and
contact the media and bragging about their exploits to their friends so they can suck their 15 minutes
of fame bone dry. It is a sad day when a 13 year old kid can make front page news tri-city for
executing a script that he didn't write and then defacing a sub domain that a big company has forgot
about existed and then it shows up on the news. Hacking is not what it used to be and it will never be
again, but there are some of us that can work to keep the media out of hacking and take this back to
the palace of the underground as it used to be. It sickens me to see such a beautiful art get turned to
dust by the media.
