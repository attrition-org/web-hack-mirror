<p>The law provides that a decision by an agency over which NAD
had jurisdiction which is adverse to a
<a href="#participant">participant</a> can be appealed to NAD by
the participant. </p>

<p>Some adverse decisions may be initially determined by an
agency as not appealable, but the Director may finally determine
if it is appealable.  A timely request may be made to NAD for a
determination of the appealability of a specific adverse decision
and the Director determines if the adverse decision is a matter
of general applicability and not subject to appeal, or adverse to
the individual participant and thus appealable. </p>

<p>An appeal must be in writing and must be submitted by the

signed personally by an appellant, but not need be notarized. </p>

<p>An appeal should be filed at the appropriate <a

<p>An appeal must be received in the Regional Office no later
than 30 calendar days after the participant first received notice
of the adverse decision (or no later than 30 calendar days after
the participant received a NAD determination that an agency
decision is appealable). The appeal should state what agency
decision is being appealed and should include, if possible, a
copy of the adverse decision and a brief statement of why the
decision is wrong. A copy of the appeal request should be sent to
the agency. </p>

<p>When a perfected appeal is received in the Regional Office, it
is assigned to a Hearing Officer.</p>

<p>An appellant may elect a telephone hearing, request a record
review, or an evidentiary hearing in person. The Hearing Officer
will consider the agency record, together with evidence submitted
by the appellant and the agency. The hearing will be conducted in
a manner that will obtain the facts relevant to the matters at
issue. There are no formal rules of evidence. An in-person
hearing will be held in the appellant&#146;s state of residence
or at a location that is otherwise convenient. A tape recording
constitutes the official record of the hearing and the parties
have a right to a copy of the official record. </p>

conference is designed to attempt to resolve the dispute or
narrow the issues involved. During the prehearing teleconference,
the hearing officer assures that everyone is prepared for the
hearing, and sets the time and place of the hearing. Stipulations
may be made, the need for specific witnesses discussed, and the
need for certain evidence decided. </p>

<p>Hearings are scheduled within 45 days of the date the appeal
was received in the <a href="reachus.htm">Regional Office</a>. At
the hearing, the appellant and the agency may present relevant
testimony and documentary evidence. The hearing officer conducts the hearing in a manner to
afford the appellant an opportunity to prove by a preponderance
of evidence that the agency&#146;s decision was erroneous. The
Hearing Officer is not bound by previous finding of fact on which
the agency&#146;s decision was based, and issues a determination
consistent with the laws and regulations of the agency and their
generally applicable interpretations. The Hearing Officer may leave
the hearing record open for a reasonable period following the
hearing for the submission of additional information. At the end
of that period, the hearing record is deemed closed. </p>
