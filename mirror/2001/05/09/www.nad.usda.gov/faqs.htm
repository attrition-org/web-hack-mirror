    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>Q.&nbsp; Does NAD hear cases involving alleged discrimination by
    an agency against a program participant?</b></font> <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; NAD hears appeals
    only from adverse determinations issued by certain agencies in relation to administration
    of certain program.&nbsp; Cases involving alleged discrimination by an agency or employee
    of USDA are the responsibility of the; <a href="http://www.usda.gov/da/cr.html">Office of
    Civil Rights</a>. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_1">7 CFR 11.1</a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; The agency did not give me appeal rights. May I still
    file an appeal?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; Any adverse decision of an agency whose appeals are adjudicated by NAD
    may be&nbsp; appealable, whether or not the agency provides appeal rights.&nbsp; For
    assistance as to&nbsp; whether an agency decision is appealable, contact the appropriate <a HREF="reachus.htm">Regional Office</a>. Be sure to include a copy of the agency
    determination and indicate when it was received.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#sec11_6a">7
    CFR 11.6(a) </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q. May I select my own hearing officer?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Hearing officers are assigned appeals by the Director. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_8">7 CFR 11.8(b)(2)</a> </p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; If I win my appeal, how soon does the agency have to
    implement the NAD determination?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; By law, the agency has 30 days from the date the appeal determination
    is final to implement&nbsp; the NAD determination.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_12">7
    CFR 11.12(a)</a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; Can I get NAD to enforce its determination?</b></font>
    </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; NAD has no authority to enforce its determination.&nbsp; The head of
    the agency is responsible&nbsp; for implementing NAD determinations.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_12">7 CFR 11.12(a)</a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; What can I do if the agency refuses to implement the
    NAD determination?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; A NAD determination is enforceable in any United States District Court
    of competent&nbsp; jurisdiction. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_13">7 CFR 11.13 </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; I was denied food stamps.&nbsp; May I appeal that
    adverse determination to NAD?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; No, the law gives NAD the authority to hear cases that arise only under
    the programs of certain agencies.&nbsp; The Food Stamp Program is not administered by any
    of the agencies over whose programs NAD has been given this authority.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_11">7 CFR 11.1 </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; I don&#146;t agree with an agency regulation.&nbsp;
    May I challenge it through NAD?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; NAD cannot rule on the correctness of either regulations or
    laws.&nbsp; Only agency&nbsp; program determinations which adversely affect a participant
    are appealable to&nbsp; NAD.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_3">7 CFR 11.3 </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; May I tell the hearing officer my side of the issue
    before the hearing?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; In the hearing, both the appellant and the agency
    representative have the opportunity to explain the issue as they see it, to hear the other
    side, and to ask questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication with the hearing officer about the
    merits of the appeal at any time other than the hearing is forbidden.&nbsp; Violation of
    this rule by an appellant can result in dismissal of the appeal.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_7">7 CFR 11.7 </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; May I have someone represent me in my appeal?</b></font>
    </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; An appellant may authorize someone to represent them at the hearing and
    throughout the appeal.&nbsp; The appellant must authorize the representative in
    writing.&nbsp; Note, however, that appellants must personally sign requests for appeals or
    reviews. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_6">7 CFR 11.6(b)(2) and&nbsp; (c) </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; May I have a mediator instead of a hearing officer?</b></font>
    </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; NAD does not mediate disputes, but appellants have the right to use any
    available alternative dispute resolution mechanism, including mediation.&nbsp; Appellants
    generally have 30 days following receipt of the agency&#146;s adverse determination within
    which to request an appeal, but if, during that 30-day period, an appellant requests
    mediation, the running of the 30-day period stops.&nbsp; If mediation ends without
    resolving the dispute,&nbsp; the clocks begins to run again from where it stopped. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;If mediation is requested after an appeal has been requested but before the
    hearing, the appellant is deemed to have waived his right to a hearing within 45 days of
    submission of the request for an appeal.&nbsp; But, if mediation does not resolve the
    dispute, the appellant has the right to a hearing within 45 days of conclusion of
    mediation. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_5">7 CFR&nbsp; 11.5(c) </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; Can the hearing officer&#146;s determination be
    appealed?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Either party may request a Director review of an appeal
    determination by a hearing officer.&nbsp; The request for review must be personally signed
    by the appellant or the head of the agency.&nbsp; Requests for review from appellants must
    be received by NAD no later than 30 calendar days after the appellant receives the hearing
    officer&#146;s determination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Requests for review from agencies must be
    received by NAD no later than 15 business days after the agency receives the hearing
    officer&#146;s determination. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_9">7 CFR 11.9 </a><br>
    &nbsp; </p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; Do I get another hearing before the Director if I
    disagree with the Hearing Officer?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; In a Director review, the hearing officer&#146;s decision is
    examined to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence on the record.&nbsp;
    The parties may, however, submit additional information for consideration during a
    Director review.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_9">7 CFR 11.9&nbsp; </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; May I ask the Director to reconsider a Director
    review determination?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Either party may request a Director reconsideration of a
    Director review determination.&nbsp; The request for reconsideration must be signed by the
    appellant or the head of the agency and must be received by NAD no later than 10 calendar
    days of receipt of the Director review determination.&nbsp; A request for reconsideration
    must include a detailed statement of a material error of fact made in the determination or
    a detailed explanation of how the determination is contrary to law or regulation which
    would justify reversal or modification of the determination. <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_11">7
    CFR 11.11 </a></p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b><p>Q.&nbsp; When is an appeal considered to be filed?</b></font> </p>
    <b><p>A.</b>&nbsp; An appeal is filed when it is received in writing, when postmarked or
    when a complete facsimile copy is received by NAD.&nbsp; Filing deadlines to request
    appeals, reviews and&nbsp; reconsiderations are set forth in the regulations.&nbsp;
    Whenever the final date for filing falls on a weekend, Federal holiday, or other day when
    NAD is not open for business, the filing deadline is extended to close of business on the
    next work day.&nbsp; The time for filing any request or document is 5:00 p.m. local time
    at the office at which the filing is made.&nbsp; <a HREF="nadregs.htm#BM11_14">7 CFR 11.14
