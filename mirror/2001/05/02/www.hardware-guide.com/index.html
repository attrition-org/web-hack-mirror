Your infected with the 1i0n worm, i fixed the backdoor, and removed the stuff from /dev/.lib, normally i wouldn't do this, but i'm pissed off right now, so whatever, tell the admin of your box to learn what security is and what not, i choose this domain cause it was kinda cool. Anyways just mv index.html.bak to index.html, and you'll be all set.... Oh, and i updated named too, so you wont get that or the ramen worm again.
