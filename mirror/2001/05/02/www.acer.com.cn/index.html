  Dear China,<br>
        We're sorry that you don't train your fighter pilots better. As a token of our apology, here's a
        copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000.(Please take note of the
        Copyright)
        <p>We're sorry that you're front-line fighter planes  can't outmaneuver a 35 year old prop-driven
        airliner. Perhaps you'd  like to consider purchasing some surplus 1950's
        era Lockheed Star Fighters from Taiwan. (We just replaced all theirs with shiny new
        F-16's).</p>
        <p>We're sorry his aircraft recognition skills were  so poor he didn't realize the EP-3 aircraft was
        propeller driven and flew his aircraft through its propeller arc, destroying
        his aircraft and nearly  killing 24 American crewmen.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We're sorry that you believe your territorial  waters extend all the way to Australia. For
        future reference, here's an  American 6th grade geography textbook. (Please
        take note of the  Copyright information printed inside the cover.)</p>
        <p>We're sorry we have to fly surveillance missions  to monitor a country that has nuclear missiles
        pointed at us.
        <p>We're sorry your fighter pilot's survival  training and equipment was so inadequate that he
        couldn't survive until your  poorly trained and equipped navy could find
        him
        (they turned down  our offer for search and rescue assistance).
        <p>We're sorry you violated international law and arrested the crewmen of an aircraft that legally
        diverted into your airfield under emergency conditions caused by your pilot's actions.
        <p>We're sorry you violated international law and boarded a state aircraft.
        <p>We're sorry that you can't seem to see your part of this incident. We know that it may seem easier
        to blame others than  to take responsibility.  Consider this fact while we  build several new Aegis destroyers for our friends in
        the Republic of  China (Taiwan).
        <p>We're especially sorry for treating you with such  respect for the last 20 years. We will definitely
        rethink this policy and probably go back to treating you like a common, untrustworthy  street gang very soon.
        <p>We're very sorry for ever granting you Most- Favored-Nation trading status and supporting your
        entrance into the  World Trade Organization. This will be rectified at the soonest
        possible  opportunity.
        <p>We're sorry the world is now seeing you for the enemy of freedom, truth, and democracy that you
        really are.
        <p>We're sorry you see yourself as a superpower when in reality you are a third world nation (the
        average Chinese worker  earns less than 10 cents a day).
        <p>We're sorry you are losing so much face over this.
        <p>We're sorry that you were able to steal missile  and nuclear secrets from us.
        <p>We're sorry you haven't learned from the Soviet  Union's collapse and failed to embrace democracy
        and capitalism  (compare tiny Taiwan and mainland China; same people, same culture,
        but Taiwan's  capitalistic economy is a powerhouse and China's economy is still
        mired in communism).
        <p>And most of all, we're sorry for the Chinese  people who suffer its leaders' incompetence.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Sincerely,
