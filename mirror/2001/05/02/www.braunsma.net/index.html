      whole story of what happened in Kashmir...)</B></FONT></P>
      <P align=center> </P>
      <P align=center><FONT color=#ffffff face=Arial size=2>1947, when India was 
      partitioned into two and Pakistan was created, the people of Kashmir  
      - a territory in between the borders of Pakistan and India (officially 
      known as Jammu and Kashmir) - demanded that they be allowed to join 
      Pakistan.  Since Kashmir was a majority Muslim state, and since 
      Pakistan was to become a Muslim nation, it made sense.  Not to India 
      however.  <B>India immediately dispatched troops all over Kashmir to 
      suppress the will and voice of the Kashmiri people.</B>  When the 
      people of Kashmir rebelled against this repression, India's first prime 
      minister Jawaharial Nehru promised the citizens of Kashmir that they would 
      choose their own fate.  <B>Nehru assured the Kashmiri people that 
      they would be allowed to do what they wanted.  Nehru claimed that the 
      sole criteria for Kashmir would be the "wishes of the Kashmiri 
      people."</B>  But soon after United Nations Resolutions were passed, 
      <B>Nehru flagrantly violated his pledge by illegally passing laws that 
      incorporated the state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Indian union, thus 
      betraying the will of the Kashmiri people that he had sworn to honor</B>, 
      and also contradicting U.N. Security Council Resolutions that had been 
      passed before.  By taking advantage of a puppet government in 
      Kashmir,<B> India made it appear so as Kashmir was ready to join India, 
      but the people of Kashmir were never even consulted about this, nor were 
      they given a choice.</B>  And so thus India illegally occupied most 
      of Kashmir for decades, and persecuted, tortured, and made life 
      excessively harsh for the vast majority Muslim population of 
      Kashmir...<B>until 1989, when the people of Jammu and Kashmir rose up to 
      fight for freedom against an Indian oppressor, a country that had for 
      years denied them their rightful independence.</B>  The popular 
      revolt for liberation increased day by day in Kashmir, and when India 
      realized that the voice of the determined Kashmiri people could not be 
      silenced, it decided to significantly increase its troop presence in the 
      territories. 60,000 Indian Troops were deployed in Indian-occupied 
      Kashmir, the largest troop presence in any area of the world. <B> In 
      order to destroy the Kashmiri freedom struggle once and forever, the 
      Indian army went on a rampage of destruction in Kashmir, killing, raping, 
      pillaging, looting, torturing, and plundering the Kashmiri Muslims, and 
      continues to do that to this day.  Over 65,000 Kashmiris have been 
      killed by the Indian force since 1989. Several thousands of young girls 
      and women have been raped, molested, and tortured. Hundreds of schools and 
      hospitals have been torched by the Indian Army, the Kashmiri children, 
      doctors, and patients, burned alive with them. Harrassment, crack-downs, 
      rape, torment, indiscriminate murder, and arbitrary arrests are a few of 
      the harsh everyday affairs which the Kashmiri people are victim to by the 
      Indian Army. This same kind of stuff happens everyday to the Palestinians 
      as well by the Israeli army, as well as to the Chechen people at the hands 
      of corrupted Russian soldiers.  </B></FONT></P>
