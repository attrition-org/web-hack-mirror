<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">War is a terrible thing and no
one knows it untill it happens. We are a small nation but we are united and we
go through a living hell every day under the rains of bullets. Many young
Macedonian soldiers and innocent victims have died during the terrorist attacks.
They are people like you and they have families who can only cry over their
loved one`s graves and pray to God that the aggresion will be soon over, so
there won`t be any more victims.<br>
<br>
Stop the lies from the mediums, because they are only interested in profiting on
other peoples lives. Don`t let be fooled by the lies of how the terrorist are
fighting for their rights. They are extremists and their only goal is to extinct
the Macedonian people so they could take over our country. They are helped by
the muslim mafia who hires merceneries to fight other people`s war.<br>
<br>
This is a message to NATO, the AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, the MEDIUMS and all the
people who spread lies about us and only want their personal interest.<br>
- You think that you are strong and think that you can do everything you want,
but we know you and you better pray that there is no war in your country,
because only then you will see what is it like to fear for your life and the
lives of your family.<br>
- You say that you want to help us, and come to our country proclaiming that you
want peace, but you let the terrorists from Kosovo from the borders that you are
guarding.<br>
- You let the NATO troups in our country to be observers and not to defend us
from the aggressors.<br>
- You don`t want us to declare a military condition in our country for it will
be your fault<br>
because the terrorist are comming from Kosovo and it is under your jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
Don`t think that we dont know anything and that we will sit quietly while our
people dies for other man`s cause.<br>
We will fight back and this is our response if you continue with your wrong
doings, we shall contiunie to take over your servers, because we have no choice.
Our voices will be heard and it is going to spread all over the world untill
somebody help us.</font></p>
