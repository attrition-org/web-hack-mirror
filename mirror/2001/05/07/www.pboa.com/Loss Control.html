Employers are always trying to increase the bottom line in the business, and often make the mistake if thinking the cost of workers' compensation
insurance is a fixed cost over which they have no control. If you are paying attention to the factors used to calculate your workers' compensation expenses, 
your hard earned profits are quietly walking out the door right in front of you.
<p>Our Loss Control Representatives are in the field everyday visiting with our customers. Our on-site evaluations start with your hiring procedures and end up on your 
production floor or job-site locations. Why do we look at your hiring process? Approximately 25% of our reported claims involve employees who have employed less than
30 days and large part of these new employee injuries happen in the first 40 hours of employment. Looking
for gaps in employment history and checking with prior employers can tell you more than you may think. Yes, the laws
are restrictive about what you can ask, and what can be said during a reference check, but the one question we teach our
insured to ask is almost certain to help you in the hiring process "Is this past employee available for rehire?" You do not need
to ask why, if the reasons are without cause of the employee, the past employer will in most cases tell you. If the answer is "NO,"
and no other comments were made as to why they would not rehire, look for other signs that make you question if this is the right employee for your company.
If you think something is wrong, it probably is. Ask our Loss Control representatives about other ways to better screen your new hires. It really does work!
<p> Is your workplace safe? Before you answer this, think real hard, and evaluate the facts. How many work related accidents have you had in the past 24 months?
How many close calls or near misses have you had in the past 24 months? OK, be honest, have you just
been lucky, and no one has been injured? Do you want one of our trained Loss Control Representatives to visit your location and help you evaluate the hazards that are present?
It is free if we provide your workers' compensation coverage.
<p>Are you concerned about having an outside person come into your facility and inspect for possible hazards? This should be a real fear for most employers, because the 
cost of an average OSHA spot inspection is enough to put you out of business. We are not connected to OSHA, and do not report any of our findings to any outside agencies. We have no ability to fine you, 
but we will assist you finding the solution to your workplace hazards, AND IT IS FREE!!!!!
<p>Most accidents are preventable, and we want to help you prevent on the job injuries. In the event you have a workplace accident, our Loss Control staff is available
to visit the accident site, and assist you in determining what caused the accident, and how future accidents can prevented.
<p>Give us a call, and let us help you.
