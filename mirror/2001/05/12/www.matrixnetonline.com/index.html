    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">On October 28th 1993, Robin 
    Raphel stated that Washington did not recognise the Instrument of Accession 
    to India as meaning that Kashmir is not forever more an integral part of 
    India. She expressed the view that the whole of Kashmir is disputed 
    territory, the future status of which must be determined in accordance with 
    the wishes of the people of Kashmir.</font> </b>
    </p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), 
    based in Geneva, recently, passed a resolution proclaiming Kashmir's 
    accession to India as bogus and null and void. The ICJ went further by 
    condemning the human rights violations in Kashmir.</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b>
    <img alt="A Postcard from Kashmir" src="http://www.ummah.org.uk/kashmir/postcard3.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="325" height="221"><font face="MS Sans Serif">These 
    events serve to highlight the disputed status of Kashmir by focusing on the 
    fraudulent nature of the Instrument of Accession which was 'signed' by the 
    Mahrajah of Kashmir on 26th October 1947.</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Indians claim that the Instrument of 
    Accession was signed by Mahrajah Hari Singh on 26th October 1947, in which 
    the Mahrajah agreed to accede to India in return for military assistance to 
    put down the popular rebellion against him, seen at that time as an invasion 
    by tribesmen from neighbouring Pakistan. The details of the accession were 
    worked out between the Kashmiri Prime Minister, MC Mahajan and the Indian 
    official, VP Menon, in Dehli. However, there are serious doubts about the 
    signing of the document. Alastair Lamb (in his book, Kashmir - A disputed 
    legacy 1846-1990) points out that the Instrument of Accession could not have 
    been signed by the Mahrajah on 26th October as he was travelling by road to 
    Jammu (a distance of over 350 Km). There is no evidence to suggest that a 
    meeting or communication of any kind took place on 26th October 1947. In 
    fact it was on 27th October 1947 that the Mahrajah was informed by his MC 
    Mahajan and VP Menon (who had flown into Srinagar), the the Instrument of 
    Accession had already been negotiated in Dehli. The Mahrajah did not in fact 
    sign the Instrument of Accession, if at all, until 27th October 1947. This 
    sheds doubts on the actions of the Indian regime. Some Indian troops had 
    already arrived and secured Srinagar airfield during the middle of October 
    1947. On 26th October 1947, a further massive airlift brought thousands of 
    Indian troops to Kashmir - BEFORE the signing of the Accession. Therefore, 
    this situation begs the question: would the Mahrajah have signed the 
    Instrument of Accession had the Indian troops not been on Kashmiri soil?</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">No satisfactory original of the Instrument 
    of Accession has ever been produced in an international forum; a published 
    form has always been shown. Further, the document was not presented to 
    Pakistan or to the UN. In the summer of 1995, the Indian authorities 
    reported the original document as lost or stolen. This sheds further doubt 
    on whether the Mahrajah actually signed the Instrument of Accession.</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Governor-General of India at the time, 
    Lord Mountbatten, stipulated that the permanent accession of Kashmir to the 
    Indian Union will only be accepted once the people of Kashmir had been 
    consulted. He noted in a letter to the Mahrajah, &quot;<i>the question of the 
    states's accession should be settled by a reference to the people</i>&quot;. 
    Furthermore, when the Kashmir crisis broke out in October 1947, the 
    principle of reference to the people through plebiscite was already 
    established as similar disputes in some other states had been resolved this 
    way. The Indian Prime Minister J Nehru, accepted this principle and 
    reiterated his position in a letter to the British Prime Minister on 25th 
    October 1947, <i>&quot;our view, which we have repeatedly made public, is that 
    the question of accession in any disputed territory must be decided in 
    accordance with the wishes of the people and we adhere to this view&quot;. </i>
    Therefore, at the time of the so-called accession, the Indian regime 
    accepted the principle of reference to the people. Based on this principle, 
    the Instrument of Accession should have been provisional and conditional 
    upon the outcome of a plebiscite.</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">When India took the Kashmir issue to the UN 
    in 1948, it did so under article 35 of Chapter VI which outlines the means 
    for a peaceful settlement of disputes. It is interesting to note here that 
    India did not present the Kashmir case under the UN Chapter VII which 
    relates to acts of aggression as India was alleging Pakistan. Therefore, it 
    is evident that by raising the issue under Chapter VI, India recognised the 
    Kashmir issue as a dispute, thus conceding that the Instrument of Accession 
    had not confirmed the state to be an integral part of India. India is still 
    party to all the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Moreover, India and Pakistan 
    accepted the UN resolutions of January 1948 calling for a plebiscite in 
    Kashmir to exercise the right of self-determination of the people of 
    Kashmir. India's acceptance of the UN resolutions establishes beyond a 
    doubt, that the future of status of Kashmir would be determined by its 
    people. Therefore, the Instrument of Accession, even if genuine, is rendered 
    null and void.</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">In the past, attempts to hold a plebiscite 
    have been met with fierce opposition from India. India has known, right from 
    the start, that the result of a plebiscite is a foregone conclusion - the 
    population of Kashmir would have voted to rid themselves of Indian rule. 
    This has been the case from 26th October 1947 to the present day. On the 
    practicality of holding a plebiscite, a paper by the US state department, 
    presented to the UN on 2nd December 1947, noted , &quot;<i>the dominion of India 
    may attempt to establish the extant electoral rolls on the basis for the 
    referendum. As these rolls are said to contain less than 7% of the 
    population and were compiled on a basis which served the weight to the 
    members of the wealthiest educated Hindu majority who would obviously vote 
    for accession to India, it is important that the electoral body should in 
    fact be composed on a basis of complete adult suffrage in order that the 
    result of the referendum may be representative of the actual wishes of the 
    people of Kashmir</i>&quot;.</font></b></p>
    <p align="right"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">In view of the above arguments, it is clear 
    that the Indian case on Kashmir is politically, legally and morally 
    unjustified. The commitment made by India and the UN to allow the people of 
    the state to choose their own future are neither time bound nor do they 
    provide an escape clause for the Indian regime. It is only through fraud and 
    repression that India continues to forcefully occupy a large portion of 
    Kashmir.</font></b></p>
