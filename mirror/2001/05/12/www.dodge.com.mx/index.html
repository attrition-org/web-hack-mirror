King Nothing

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased
And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play thing king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name
Where's your crown?
King nothing
Hard and cold
Bought and sold
A heart hard as gold
Are you satisfied
Wish I may
Wish I might
You wish your life away
Are you pacified
All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased
And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Where's your crown?
King nothing
I wish I may
I wish I might
Have this wish tonight
I want the star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it
Careful what you wish
You just might get it
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around King nothing
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name
Off to never never land
