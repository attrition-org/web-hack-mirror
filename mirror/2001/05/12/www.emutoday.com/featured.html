<h1 align=center>Moving and Shaking in Colorado --- Locating and Pursuing Grants</h1>

After more than six years in the big bird business, Kay Loden of High Country Exotics in Crawford, Colorado decided to take it upon herself to create a market for her birds.
<p>
With a background in state and federal programs and grant
research for a number of years, she decided to put that knowledge
to good use and pursue a grant for the Intermountain Ratite
Association (IRA), of which she is a member.
<p>
"I just assumed that (there were larger associations)
cooperating with the government to obtain some kind of funding for
research," says Loden, "but to my amazement there wasn't." 
<p>
When Loden approached the Intermountain Ratite Association,
she explained her plan. "I said, 'Do you want to see if we can
secure some funds from the government to help us along our way? And
if you are interested then I'll volunteer my time.'" The group was
certainly interested, and by the time they met again, Loden had
identified the grant to pursue. "And we did it together," says
Loden. 
<p>
After reviewing the application and requirements, the IRA
voted to pursue the grant. "So we formed a committee and that's
what we did - we went for it," says Loden, who was voted project
coordinator.
<p>
The group enthusiastically applied for an Agricultural
Processing Feasibility Grant Program for $15,000 from the Colorado
State Department of Agriculture. The application was sponsored by
the Western Colorado Business Development Corp. Approximately 3
months later, their request was approved and funds were allocated. 
<p>
According to Loden, the grant was obtained in conjunction with
the cooperative extension office in the Tri-County Area, and was a
1/3-1/3-1/3 grant (1/3 private or organization money, 1/3 volunteer
time and resources equal to a cash value, and 1/3 government funds)
for a total project cost of $23,000.
<p>
In the grant application, the proposal stated the
Intermountain Ratite Association's request to conduct a market
feasibility study "to determine if sufficient market potential
exists in Western Colorado to warrant the investment in a Ratite
Processing Facility."
<p>
After the grant was obtained, the IRA's newly formed
management team went shopping for processing plants. "We visited
Country Morning Plant in Dublin, Texas and several other locations
in Oklahoma and Colorado," says Loden, "to learn how the plants
were operating, and what was successful for them, etc." 
<p>Once the study was completed, IRA representatives took the
results to the State Commissioner of Agriculture and held a
meeting. "And they agreed at that time to support the ratite
industry in the state of Colorado," says Loden.
<p>
The team next went out and located a USDA processing facility
that was for sale in Fruita, Colorado, which was already processing
beef, pork, sheep, deer and elk.
<p>
"We purchased Monument Meats after negotiating our financing
with the owner, who agreed to take a down payment and carry the
balance of the note," says Loden. The team then raised a down
payment by forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) and selling
shares.
<p>
Meanwhile, additional property next to Monument Meats was
purchased by an IRA investor to be used for future expansion.
<p>
"We're going to operate the plant the way it was prior to our
purchase," says Loden. "In addition to the different types of
livestock already being processed, we also plan to process ostrich,
emus, rheas, and buffalo, and develop a specialty line of meats." 
<p>
According to Loden, the association will be processing
members' animals first. During negotiations, the plant continued to
operate. "We're open already," says Loden. "As a matter of fact we
never closed it down." Loden related that they already have a USDA
number to process ratite and buffalo, and to date have processed
five ostriches and five emus. 
<p>
"We hired a new plant manager and are in the process of hiring
other personnel," says Loden. "We're preparing our plant to begin
processing birds on a regular basis. We also have people involved
that raise buffalo and elk, so our facility will accommodate these
producers, too."
<p>
"We're real excited," exclaimed Loden. "We've contacted some
large grocery chains who are very interested in handling our meat.
So we not only have a product, but we have a way to process it, and
we also have a market for it!"
<p>
In addition to the above mentioned grant, Loden explained that
their loan to buy Monument Meats was underwritten by a tax-free
bond from the Colorado Agricultural Development Authority (CADA).
A loan for $75,000 was obtained form the Western Colorado
Development Corp., "...which is like an economic development agency
in Mesa County," says Loden. "These funds are to be used to buy
additional equipment to retrofit the plant, and for operating
capital for at least the first 3-4 months."
<p>
Loden related that she is willing to help others who are
interested in utilizing government funds available to ratite
producers. "If anyone wants to call me and discuss how we got
started, I would be glad to help them." 
<p>
"I think that everyone in the industry needs to be doing this
in their state," adds Loden. "But it's important to do it together.
Get together with all the ratite associations and organizations in
the state and don't exclude anyone." 
<p>
"Go to the State Department of Agriculture, and let them know
you're there and what you're about. They have a lot of resources
that are free and that are accessible to us. And we need to utilize
those resources."
<p>
According to Loden, currently there are close to 40 IRA
members, with some members from Utah. "We even had some people out
of the Rocky Mountain Ostrich Association and the Colorado Emu
Association (CEA) come over and join us because we were moving and
shaking I presume." 
<p>
"We were moving along so they wanted to be part of the
organization and their support, and keep up with us through our
newsletters and meetings," says Loden. "So far, everything is going
as well as can be expected for novices."
<p>
While the association is focusing most of its efforts on
developing markets for their meat, they are also investigating
markets for oil, and looking for a place, perhaps in Mexico, to tan
their hides. "We're also interested in networking with other groups
and organizations," relates Loden.
<p>
The story doesn't end here. "As a result of our study,"
related Loden, "the Colorado State Department of Agriculture has
formed what we call a CORE (Colorado Ostrich, Rhea, Emu) Council."
The group meets once a month in Denver at the Colorado State
Department of Agriculture.
<p>
The monthly meeting is hosted by Jim Rubhing, Marketing
Director for the State Department of Agriculture. "He assists us in
doing marketing surveys in the state, working with our state
veterinarian, and anything that we need done in the industry," says
Loden. 
<p>
"We assemble a group made up of the Colorado Emu Association,
Emu Producers Co-op, Rocky Mountain Ostrich Association members,
and the Intermountain Ratite Association. Together we discuss what
problems we're having and then we work together for a solution,"
related Loden. "What we're there to do is to advise them of what
our needs are and use their expertise in guiding us toward what's
feasible and practical and what isn't, so it's been a great help to
us."
<p>
Loden feels that other ratite farmers, associations, and
groups can accomplish the same feats in their states. "I feel like
if the government, especially the USDA and the Department of
Agriculture, had been involved in the onset of this industry we
would have been a lot further along with industry promotions,
etc.," said Loden.
<p>
"I feel that if the government is involved, they will be more
aware and responsive to what the ratite industry is all about. And
instead of fearing them and their regulations, you should realize
that people are the government, and they are there to help us to
accomplish what we need to accomplish," declared Loden.
<p>
"As a united front representing the ratite industry, we've had
a direct major impact on creating some of our own regulations
regarding ratites," says Loden. "It is kind of a foreign industry
to (government officials, etc.) so they appreciate our endeavors."
<p>
How was it possible for such a small group to accomplish so
much in such a relatively short period of time? "It took a lot of
work and a lot of cooperation from everyone in our association,"
explained Loden. "Everyone supported our efforts and attended the
meetings and did what was needed to make the efforts successful." 
<p>
"We just took our little group and with a lot of hard work and
determination developed a strategic plan to accomplish our purpose.
Now we are prepared to move forward to our next project: primarily
getting the 'meat on the street'," says Loden.
