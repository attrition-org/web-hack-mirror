<li>Easily washable with most mild soaps and detergents.  The surface 
is not affected by most strong cleaners and it is basically nonstaining 
due to the nonporous surface.  Porcelain enamel steel surfaces are 
ideal for all magnets and magnetic impregnated materials used as teaching 
aids.  AllianceWall® porcelain enamel surfaces are 100% noncombustible
and have 0-0-0 fire hazard classification.</li>

<li>Markerboards feature the AllianceWall® porcelain enamel 
semi-gloss surface which gives the full color value to dry erase markers 
with negligible marker wear and produces clear, sharp marker lines for
maximum contrast and control of glare. The non-porous surface wipes clean 
with a dry cloth or eraser.</li>
