is the ultimate in visual display versatility.

Our Remarkable Boards porcelain surface 
accepts the use of almost any writing instrument;
chalk, felt tip markers, grease pencils, pens, pencils,
or crayons. All can be wiped clean with a damp cloth.
Even permanent markers can be erased with a mild solvent.  
The Remarkable Boards' surface is fully magnetic and can also
be used as a projection screen surface.
With so many uses it's no wonder we call it "Remarkable".
