race.<P><P><P><P>This will be my last few sites in this so called cyber war turned ugly. Im saddened by the outcome of
this all. When it first started with myself poisonb0x and the chinese crackers - it wasnt hateful towards each other -
maybe some petty instigating - but anything serious was directed towards the others government. Now - thanks to
contributions from reporters full of assumptions this has turned into a media frenzy - drawing out the worst in the US
hackers. When I started reading sites calling the chinese gooks and worse - with pornographics images - and hateful comments - $chinese have maintained a pretty clean approach to this whole thing and not gotten too personnal - save some of the US pig
comments - which were mostly directed at the government. When I first started with this it was only for fun - bragging
rights between two countries hacker communities. I wish it would have stayed there - but it didnt. <P><P> To the US   
hackers who have become hateful and racial - you need to grow up and take a look at your politics and your attitude
towards humanity. <P><P> To the Chinese hackers - you proved me wrong and stepped up to the plate nailing alot of our
servers. I still think were better though. grin. <P><P> This will be my last few sites as I said - To avoid trouble and
also to urge others to just drop this already - on both sides. <P><P>puhrahfit@hushmail.com - pr0phet 
<p><p> yeh I know this isnt a .cn site - thats kind of the point. its over people.
