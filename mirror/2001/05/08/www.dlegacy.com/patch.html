            <b>Description:</b><br>
            A wise man once said, "When a single exploit is released, it's a good 
            hack. When you are the first to hack each successive version of a 
            product run on millions of computers all over the internet, you create 
            a dynasty."<br>
            <br>
            It seems sometimes the greatest discoveries are the ones that are 
            the hardest to share with the world. It's not about a lack of wanting 
            to tell everyone, but a lack of not knowing exactly how to put it 
            so that people's jaws do not drop so fast that their heads snap back 
            as they realize just how fragile our world is becoming. We are slowly 
            pushing society into the digital world people only dreamed about years 
            ago -- a world in which everything is being connected and little is 
            being done to shore up the large looming gaps that are in existence 
            in today's networked systems.<br>
            <br>
            And without further ado... eEye Digital Security presents, "Remote 
            SYSTEM level access to any default Windows 2000 IIS 5.0 Web server."<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Discovery:</b><br>
            This bug was first discovered while Riley Hassell, of eEye Digital 
            Security, was updating <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/html/Products/Retina/index.html">Retina's</a> 
            <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Papers/DS20010106.html">CHAM 
            (Common Hacking Attack Methods)</a> technology to look for unknown 
            vulnerabilities within some of the new features that Windows 2000 
            IIS 5.0 provides. One of the features that was added to be audited 
            by CHAM was the .printer ISAPI filter extension. Once the .printer 
            ISAPI filter was added to the list of ISAPI's to audit, as well as 
            various aspects of the new Web DAV functionality within IIS, the latest 
            <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/html/Products/Retina/index.html">Retina</a> 
            development code was let loose against a test server in our lab. Within 
            a matter of minutes, a debugger kicked in on inetinfo.exe because 
            of a "buffer overflow error."<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Explanation:</b><br>
            It turns out the latest development code of <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/html/Products/Retina/index.html">Retina</a> 
            was able to find a buffer overflow within the .printer ISAPI filter 
            (C:\WINNT\System32\msw3prt.dll) which provides Windows 2000 with support 
            for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) which allows for the Web 
            based control of various aspects of networked printers.<br>
            <br>
            The vulnerability arises when a buffer of aprox. 420 bytes is sent 
            within the HTTP Host: header for a .printer ISAPI request.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Example:</b><br>
            GET /NULL.printer HTTP/1.0<br>
            Host: [buffer]<br>
            <br>
            Where [buffer] is aprox. 420 characters.<br>
            <br>
            At this point an attacker has sucessfully caused a buffer overflow 
            within IIS and has overwritten EIP. Now normally the Web server would 
            stop responding once you have "buffer overflowed" it. However, Windows 
            2000 will automatically restart the Web server if it notices that 
            the Web server has crashed. While the feature is nice to help create 
            a longer period of "up time", it is actually a feature that makes 
            it easier for remote attacks to execute code against Windows 2000 
            IIS 5.0 Web servers.<br>
            <br>
            As we stated earlier, our overflow is able to overwrite the EIP register 
            with whatever we want. That basically means we can overwrite EIP with 
            a location in memory that jumps to our "exploit" code, in memory, 
            and then executes our code with SYSTEM level access.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Exploit:</b><br>
            Ryan Permeh, resident shellcode ninja of eEye Digital Security, has 
            created an example exploit to be used as a "proof-of-concept". Our 
            proof-of-concept exploit will, when run against an IIS 5 Web server, 
            create a text document on the remote server with instructions directing 
            readers to a Web page on eeye.com that has information on how to patch 
            the system so that the Web server is no longer vulnerable to this 
            flaw. This exploit is to only be considered a proof-of-concept exploit 
            and anyone with Windows 2000 should install the Microsoft supplied 
            patch ASAP. <br>
            <br>
            Proof of concept exploit:<br>
            <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/html/research/Advisories/iishack2000.c">http://www.eeye.com/html/research/Advisories/iishack2000.c</a><br>
            This exploit will simply create a file in the root of drive c:\ with 
            instructions on how to patch your vulnerable server. If you are running 
            Windows 2000 then please install the Microsoft security patch and 
            do not depend on this exploit as being a tool to test whether your 
            vulnerable or not because if you have not installed the patch then 
            you are most likely vulnerable.<br>
            <br>
            We would like to note that eEye Digital Security did provide Microsoft 
            with a working exploit. This exploit, when ran against a Web server, 
            will bind a cmd.exe command prompt to an IIS remote port within seconds. 
            This allows a remote attacker to execute commands with SYSTEM level 
            access and thereby have full control over the vulnerable machine.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Log:</b><br>
            Actually there is no log because this vulnerability, like most IIS 
            buffer overflows, does not get logged. That means some of the largest 
            Web servers on the Internet running Windows 2000 are vulnerable to 
            this attack and when exploited, there will be no IIS log anywhere 
            that records the attack.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Fallout:</b><br>
            As with our first remote SYSTEM level exploit for IIS 4.0 two years 
            ago, the fallout from this second IIS remote overflow is also rather 
            large. Once again it does not matter what kind of security systems 
            you have in place, Firewalls, IDS's, etc., because all of these systems 
            can be bypassed and your Web server CAN be broken into via this vulnerability. 
            To quote our last advisory: "Even a server that's locked in a guarded 
            room behind a Cisco Pix can be broken into with this hole. This is 
            a reminder to all software vendors that testing for common security 
            holes in your software is a must. Demand more from your software vendors." 
            There are millions of Windows 2000 Web servers on the Internet right 
            now that are wide open to this vulnerability.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Magic:</b> <br>
            About two weeks ago eEye Digital Security released, <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/html/Products/SecureIIS/index.html">SecureIIS</a> 
            which stops both known and unknown IIS Web server vulnerabilities. 
            Our SecureIIS code base from about 4 weeks ago actually stopped this 
            latest IIS 5.0 buffer overflow vulnerability without actually knowing 
            anything about it. It is this power to stop both known and unknown 
            vulnerabilities that sets SecureIIS apart from every other security 
            product in the market. Visit <a 
                        href="http://www.eeye.com/SecureIIS">http://www.eeye.com/SecureIIS</a> 
            to learn more about this ground-breaking product.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Vendor Status:</b><br>
            We would like to thank Microsoft for working hard with us to create 
            a patch for this vulnerability.<br>
            You can download the Microsoft supplied patch from: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-023.asp<br>
            Also eEye Digital Security recommends removing the .printer ISAPI 
            filter from your Web server if it does not provide your Web server 
            with any _needed_ functionality.<br>
