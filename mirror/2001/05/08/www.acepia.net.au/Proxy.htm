    <strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Proxies can help get the best performance for Web
    browsing, and the more people that use the proxy, the better it gets. Because of this,
    Acepia users use our Proxy Server to access the World Wide Web.<br>
    <br>
    Our web proxy speeds up access to popular sites by keeping copies of the most frequently
    accessed sites on our servers. By accessing the locally stored files, you get much better
    transfer rates, usually at the maximum rate for your modem, even with the most popular
    sites on the net!<br>
    <br>
    Acepia's current proxy setup consists of two servers running concurrently at our Melbourne
    headquarters. <br>
    <br>
    Both servers work together, so that if one doesn't contain the requested object, it asks
    its sibling for the information. If neither machine contains the requested object or data,
    it is then sourced from the Internet and held in cache. This means that the proxies
    complement each other with minimal overlap between their caches. It also allows them to
    act as one larger cache, providing a better overall hit rate.</font></strong></td>
