    </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Acepia has designed and built one of the most
    sophisticated Internet Networks in Victoria. Housed at our Headquarters in Croydon,
    Victoria, it offers a reliable, fast, versatile network connection for all business or
    personal connectivity requirements.</strong></font><font face="Arial"><br>

    </font><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Reliability

Throughout our network, we have Cisco 7500 series routers, which feature dual processors as well as dual DC power supplies. They are housed in a stable and secure environment at AAPT exchanges. The core network is built using Cascade Frame relay switches and interconnected by Megalinks and Broadlinks, with all major presences connected to Melbourne and Sydney for completely redundant paths. The AAPT exchanges have high capacity fibre optic services from both Telstra and Optus installed.

With dedicated 100 Mbps FDDI links to Telstra Internet Services' international connection out of Melbourne, our international links offer superior speed and reliability.

Inside Australia, we have multiple direct links to Access One as well as Telstra Internet and Netscape Communications for the most direct path possible to other carriers' domestic sites.

Speed

The core of Acepia's network is built with 45 Mbps HSSI connections between the Cisco 7513 routers and Cascade Frame switches. These are supplemented by 7507 boundary routers for external domestic and international traffic.

Acepia's primary location, and subsidiary users are equipped with 7507s, with HSSI connections between the routers and frame switches. All of these sites support ISDN Primary Rate access and high-speed serial access as well as N*64 fractional E1 access.

Versatility

Acepia also has Points of Presence (POPs) in other metropolitan as well as rural areas in Victoria. These include POPs in Healesville, Mornington, Phillip Island and Warragul. We have ISDN capability in all of these locations.

We are also close to implementing global roaming between the networks, so that international travellers can use the Internet in many locations without applying for a separate account.

Intelligence

Acepia's Proxy Server makes sure that the network is used with the utmost efficiency. By caching requests from all of our clients, the proxy server keeps usage of the international links down, improving response times to our customers and keeping operating costs down, savings that we can pass on to you.

The caches sit directly on our Melbourne hub with 100Mbit/s interfaces to our
network. The Melbourne cache is attached to a load sharing mechanism to assure reliability and speed." --></td>
