      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The Earth is controlled by
    two main factions, the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) and the United Civilized States
    (UCS). The Eurasian Dynasty encompasses what was once Europe and Asia in our
    world today, while the UCS comprises most of North and South America. Not
    only are the ED and UCS on opposite sides of the world, they also have
    completely opposite social structures. The ED are not highly technically
    advanced and rely on older weapons and technologies. However, the UCS are
    much more advanced and have reached the point where machines do all of the
    work for the society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Eventually the UCS invades
    part of the ED's territory and world war breaks out, lasting for many years,
    with the ultimate culmination being a decisive nuclear strike against the
    UCS in the North Pole. This horrendous event pushes the Earth out of its
    orbit, leading the UCS and ED to want to build their own escape fleets to
    leave the Planet. However, after years of war and turmoil, there are only
    enough resources left to complete one escape fleet.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">To make matters even worse,
    a new force, the Lunar Corporation, has arrived on the earth in an attempt
    to acquire resources as well. This long forgotten society had moved into
    space to begin colonization of Mars. Their base was on the Moon and their
    society is highly advanced, however unused to warfare. Once again, global
    warfare breaks out between the three factions, however this time the losers
    will be totally eliminated!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">The
    Year is 2150</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The war for the remaining
    resources on the Earth is still in effect, while no faction seems to have
    the upper hand. Eventually an amazing discovery is found on the Earth's
    moon. There is an alien base, which contains a massive weapon of
    destruction, which could be used to attack the Earth, turning the war in
    favor of whoever captured this technology. Once again the three factions are
    in a desperate race to acquire what they need to survive and win the war.
    The future of humanity hangs in the balance!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"><i>The Moon Project</i>
    (TMP) is a real time strategy game allowing you to play out the struggle for
    survival on the ravaged Earth, as any of the three major factions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Initiate Software Download</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">

      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Before you can begin to win
    your battles and save humanity, you need to load the game software. There
    are various installation options, giving you a good amount of control over
    the size and overall performance of the program on your hard disk. There are
    also spawned install options, which allow other people to play without
    having the game CDs, as well as other components needed for <i>The Moon
    Project</i> to run correctly, such as drivers and video tools.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Overall the software
    installation went smoothly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Your Instructions,
    Commander</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although you are expected to be an
    experienced war veteran already, you are given an excellent manual to help
    train your officers and to aid in refreshing your memory. If you have played
    <i>Earth 2150</i>, then you have already read a major portion of <i>The Moon
    Project's</i> manual, with additions including the distinctive features of
    this sequel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the fine features of the manual is
    that it gives you some of the critical information at the outset,
    particularly about carrying over units and resources between missions, which
    is extremely important and quite different from other real time strategy
    (RTS) games. Other areas, from backstory, to unit and weapon overview are
    also covered very comprehensively.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">What Does This Button Do?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Helped in understanding by
    the Manual, the interface is, at least at first, quite complex, with two
    main portions - camera and game world control. Generally, camera control is
    extremely easy to use, allowing movable viewing area, camera rotation, angle
    of view and zoom all to be readily manageable with the mouse. Overall, this
    interface is clean and fairly easy to use. There is also a nice compass in
    the upper portion of the screen to help you if you become disoriented.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic3.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">A few extra features of the
    camera system include being able to follow a specific unit or group of units
    automatically without moving the mouse, being able to use the games mini-map
    to jump around the game environment, and being able to have three different
    camera views of the world simultaneously in different windows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Now that the excellent
    camera control is established, we shall move on to the rest of the game's
    user interface, which can take up a large amount of the game screen.
    Luckily, most of the various information menus and panels can be turned on
    or off to suit your personal tastes. Most of the user interface is contained
    in various panels on the bottom of the screen, including a Mini-Map view of
    the game world, and main controls for the game - where you can issue orders,
    etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">On the right side of the
    screen, we find another control panel, which allows for construction and
    building of units and vehicles, as well as presenting research and mission
    choice interfaces.. Here you can build the various units and structures for
    the faction you are controlling. Overall, there are a large number of panels
    and interfaces in <i>The Moon Project</i>; however they are well done. With
    thoughtful touches, such as ability to pause and issue and order as well as
    move the camera, this slightly cumbersome, huge option interface may be
    daunting at first, but grows on the player and earns a 90 for its overall
    quality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Sound Off</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Earth 2150 was plagued with
    a small amount of music and repetitive sounds. The good news is that TMP has
    a better selection of music which plays in the background, and also changes
    with the mood of the game. For instance, while base building and exploring
    the map the music is more peaceful, however once a battle begins the music
    picks up the beat and adds a sense of urgency to the game. Unfortunately,
    the repetitive and annoying unit acknowledgements are still present,
    although serving their purpose adequately. The sound effects, such as
    weapons and construction, are well done.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Bringing the sound package
    down, unfortunately, is that they are really subdued and difficult to hear.
    I put all of the sound settings on maximum and I still had a difficult time
    hearing various things, such as unit acknowledgements and the music. Instead
    of forcefully coming to the front, the music stays in the shadows, which is
    too bad since it is actually very good. In the end we have some great music
    and sound effects, with some average unit acknowledgements. If the sounds
    had only been a little louder it would have been close to perfect. Thus, the
    sound and music score for TMP gets an 80.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">It's In the Details</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic4.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">While graphics do not make
    or break most games, they do provide a more aesthetic gaming experience.
    Luckily, <i>The Moon Project</i> comes through in the graphics department.
    First, there are many graphical options that can be customized for the game,
    including both 16-bit and 32-bit color depths, as well as resolutions from
    640*480 up to 1600*1200. Lighting, shadows, and view distance can be
    tweaked. Multiple renderers are available for use, such as Glide or Direct
    3D. Overall, you should be able to get The Moon Project running smoothly and
    looking the best it can with the available options.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Looking at some of the
    specific features of the graphics, we find the environments quite
    impressive, with a lot of detail evident in various terrains, including
    snow-capped peaks, ripples in the water, ruins of destroyed buildings, and a
    new moon environment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The level of detail in <i>The
    Moon Project</i> is excellent. Parts will move on the various vehicles and
    structures. For instance, on combat vehicles turrets will move to track a
    target and radar dishes will spin. On various buildings you can see the bay
    doors open to release a newly constructed unit or conveyor belts will move
    to accept cargo. The construction of the various structures is also
    animated, depending on your alignment. If you play as the Lunar Corporation
    your buildings are created in orbit and then ferried down to the Earth with
    space ships. You actually get to see the building being dropped down to the
    planet. It is subtle details like this that help the player become more
    immersed in the gaming world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Carrying on with graphic
    detail, we find each of the weapon systems in the game to be fully animated
    and distinct. Launched rockets leave behind a smoke trail, energy based
    weapons light up the terrain, and Ion cannons encompass the target in an
    energy field. Speaking of smoke, smoke clouds are also produced from the
    Eurasian Dynasty's vehicles and power plants, which is a nice touch
    considering that the ED is supposed to still use fossil fuels instead of
    more technologically advanced methods of power generation. The explosions in
    <i>The Moon Project</i> are also well done and are believable.</font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic5.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">There are two final great
    points to the graphics engine of the game. Just like in the real world, this
    fictional Earth has a day and night cycle. During the early or late hours it
    can actually be harder to see your surroundings, while during the day things
    are much more visible. Another nice touch is that during the night
    headlights and spotlights will come on automatically for your vehicles and
    buildings. The second great feature of the graphics engine in TMP is the
    weather effects. There are clouds, fog, rain, snow, and even meteor
    showers.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Although aesthetically
    pleasing, the weather actually plays a large role in the game. The Lunar
    Corporation relies on solar power, so in bad weather their energy production
    is hindered. Fog can actually make it more difficult to see the map. Rain
    and snow can affect the speed at which some of your units travel. Lastly,
    meteors can damage your army and structures. Overall the use of weather is
    just about perfect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a bit of a downside to the
    graphics engine in TMP. First, it is almost an exact version of the <i>Earth
    2150</i> engine. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you were looking
    for something completely new you will not find it here. The other problem
    with the graphics was an occasional artifact appearing while running in
    Direct 3D mode, however once in Glide mode these cleared up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Initiate Moon Project</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"><i>The Moon Project</i> is
    a real time strategy game, similar to the <i>Warcraft</i> and <i>Command and
    Conquer</i> series. The general idea is simple - gather resources, build an
    army, and crush your opponent. You will also need to build a base or two,
    maybe capture a few enemy units, and quite possibly go on a rescue mission.
    This is all fairly standard gaming in the RTS world; luckily <i>The Moon
    Project</i> expands upon the normal RTS model and offers something slightly
    different.</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic6.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">One of these nice additions
    to the normal RTS gaming model allows you to build tunnels underground and
    through mountains. This new element enables you to build a tunnel system to
    come above ground behind an enemy base. You can also secretly move units
    from one location to another using your tunnels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">There is an immense
    research and technology tree in <i>The Moon Project</i>. You can research
    and upgrade weapons, chassis types, and other defensive structures. If
    playing as the Eurasian Dynasty, you can research laser technology
    eventually. Once researched, you can also upgrade the technology to be even
    more powerful. Each faction has some similar and unique items that can be
    researched, making their side even more powerful.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Researching new toys of
    destruction is great; however, what do you do with them once you have them?
    Unlike most RTS games, <i>The Moon Project</i> actually lets you construct
    your vehicles, at least to a point, with the use of a unit customization
    panel in the interface. The basic steps to constructing a new vehicle type
    are quite simple. First you will choose a chassis from the available
    selection; then add various types of equipment to your vehicle - such as
    power shields, repair modules, multiple weapon systems, detector devices.
    Once the design is finished, you can add it to the list of units to be
    built, even giving it a unique name and saving it for use in skirmish or
    multiplayer games. In the end, you can decide just exactly what type of army
    you will construct. This is a level of management missing from other RTS
    games and it is a welcome addition.</font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic7.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The main part of <i>The
    Moon Project</i> is taking part in the storyline and going through the
    campaigns for each of the factions. First you must decide which faction to
    follow, and then you are on your way to leading your forces to hopeful
    victory. The mission structure is another area where we find <i>The Moon
    Project</i> differing from many of its contemporaries. Normally, each
    mission in a RTS game is distinct; however in The Moon Project everything
    blends together to form one continuous campaign. The game accomplishes this
    by providing a main base from which you stage each of your various
    missions.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">You can perform research in
    that base, construct units, and build structures, as well as transport units
    and resources to and from the mission area. One thing to note is that your
    resources at the main base, as well as for each mission, are distinct. Once
    you complete a mission, before you officially end it, you should move all of
    your resources and units back to the main base, otherwise you will lose them
    permanently. This is a nice change from the normal mission structure of RTS
    games. It also makes you want to keep your units intact so you can use them
    later in the game.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">And what is left after you
    finish the single player portion of the game? There are skirmish and
    multiplayer modes included. Instead of only offering the basic deathmatch
    style game, TopWare included seven different and interesting
    skirmish/multiplayer modes. One of these is referred to as 'Hide-n-Seek'.
    This mode is equivalent to capture the flag, as you must locate and capture
    the enemy's flag in their base and bring it back to your base. Another
    skirmish mode is called 'Arena'. Here there is no building, research, or
    resource gathering.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Instead, all you do is
    fight against your opponents with a limited amount of units. Once your units
    are destroyed they will respawn and various power-ups can be found across
    the map for your use. One other gameplay mode is called 'Tech War,' where
    you have unlimited money and the entire technology tree is already
    researched. Obviously, the people at TopWare put a lot of thought into
    extending the game beyond its single player campaign and it really shows
    with all of the special skirmish and multiplayer modes available.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">What we have, in one sense,
    with <i>The Moon Project</i>, is an excellent top of the line real time
    strategy game. There are however a few complaints which bringing the game
    down to more average levels. One of the downsides is that the game is
    extremely complex and will take a long time to fully master. This can be a
    major turn off for a person new to the RTS genre. The complexity also takes
    away from some of the fun of the game, since there is a lot to keep track
    of. Another minor problem with the game is that everything takes a
    considerable amount of time.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Research can take four or
    more minutes per technology and a unit can take over thirty seconds to
    produce. You can increase the game speed, however this makes it even more
    difficult to play. One other downside to <i>The Moon Project</i> is that it
    is extremely hard. It is quite easy to lose your entire army, while barely
    making a dent in the enemy's defenses. Obviously, different strategies will
    yield better results; however even on the easiest skill setting it is very
    easy to lose. This will alienate the new RTS player once again. Another
    fairly major gripe is that at the end of a mission it can take a while to
    ferry all of your units and resources back to your main base. It would have
    been nice to have a quick transport method to accomplish the same task. The
    last major complaint against <i>The Moon Project</i> is that it is, at best,
    an expansion for<i> Earth 2150</i>, even though it comes packaged as a
    stand-alone product. The amount of new content found in the game simply
    doesn't justify this.</font></p>

    <font size="2" color="#F0E0B0">In the end, we are graced with an extremely
    good RTS game. There are three unique and interesting sides to choose from,
    three campaigns to explore, and a wealth of skirmish/multiplayer modes.
    There is also a lot of game to learn and master. What essentially brings the
    game down is the difficulty and slower pace, as well as a few management
    issues. If you have not played <i>Earth 2150 </i>and are yearning for a deep
    and engrossing RTS game, then <i>The Moon Project</i> might be exactly what
    you are looking for.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#F0E0B0" face="Verdana">If you have <i>Earth 2150</i>
    and loved it, then <i>The Moon Project</i> might help rekindle that love,
    but at a full game price. However, if you hated <i>Earth 2150</i>, there is
    nothing exceptionally new in <i>The Moon Project </i>to make you change your
    opinion. There is a demo for the game available and I highly recommend
    trying it before parting with your hard earned money. <i>The Moon Project</i>
    is a great RTS game, but not be for everyone.</font></p>
