    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The original <i>Tribes</i>
    was released over two years ago, and began in the eyes of many what has
    become the team-based online action game. Following in its shoes were <i>Team
    Fortress, Counter-Strike, Unreal Tournament</i>, and countless others.
    However, all were basically the same iteration of a like idea. None so far
    have managed to make a truly revolutionary leap forward, or to truly connect
    the players as a genuine team dynamic. <i>Tribes 2</i>, the sequel to the
    original, promised all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Finally released after
    years of waiting, developer Dynamix has overhauled the graphics engine,
    improved the sounds, added a story and an off-line mode, as well as a score
    of new gameplay features. To top it off, <i>Tribes 2</i> now allows hundreds
    of players to compete in the same servers. However, is the game truly the
    revolution it promised? <i>Tribes 2</i> presents a conundrum - it promises
    and delivers innovation, but at the same time it is still the same, basic
    gameplay concept with all of the requisite strengths and weaknesses of its
    predecessor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#ffcc00" size="4">&quot;We can make a
    new beginning, all of us. Together we need not choose war.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic2.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"><i>Tribes 2</i> has an
    interesting and somewhat odd set up for play. Once installed, there will be
    two shortcuts created. One is for Off-Line play, with the other for Online
    multiplayer. Unfortunately, the game has an entirely different program to
    run for the single player game, and there is no way to switch between the
    two without exiting. So, you will need to configure your options for each
    side of the game, which is quite a nuisance.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> The Off-Line mode basically
    consists of 6 training missions. Though a full-fledged campaign was
    promised, these missions are nothing more than tutorials with a small plot
    interspersed in-between. The game mechanics do not lend themselves well to
    the static, small games of the tutorial, but it does a good enough job of
    teaching &quot;New Bloods&quot; the basics of gameplay, as once you go
    online, the competition and action is cutthroat. Also, the in game interface
    is explained, and it's true ease of use, power, and intuitiveness is shown.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">
    The only lingering complaint I have, which remains from the first game, is
    that the Commander Screen, where orders can be given, is still hard to use,
    at least at first. Thankfully, it is nowhere near as complex as the last one
    and it takes a bit of getting used to uncover its usefulness, and it is a
    vast improvement over its successor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Of a sad note, though, is
    the uselessness of the manual. Covering none of the advanced gameplay
    concepts, or even a basic summation of what the story is supposed to be, the
    manual is pathetic. Giving no statistics of any real use, most, if not all,
    of the information from the manual can be gained from the tutorial or in
    game practice. I would truly have preferred a more in-depth look at hosting
    options and maps, and I also would have liked to see a more comprehensive
    explanation of weapons, uses, and functions. I also would have liked more
    information on the voice communication support. Overall, the manual must be
    the single worst part of the <i>Tribes 2</i> experience.</font></p>

    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Online is, of course, where
    <i>Tribes 2</i> comes alive. Upon the first load of the Online portion of
    the game, the sheer usefulness and ability of the finder is realized. The
    finder is used to not only search for and join games, but to select player
    models, voices, and various other customization options, much like the first
    game. However, it is immediately evident that much work has been done to
    improve and simplify the overall experience.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> Equipped with new
    &quot;Community&quot; sections, the new interface allows for email to be
    sent and received, clans to be managed, online forums and chats to be
    accessed, and a regularly updated news page for announcements. There is even
    a new Buddy List system for tracking and joining with friends. All in all, <i>Tribes
    2</i> has one of the most functional, attractive, and easy-to-use systems.
    All of these features equate to a speedy joining process, an unparalleled
    amount of features, and easy access and usage of the ever-active Tribes
    community. (note: the community features are at this time down due to the
    unexpected load on the servers, but should be working in full order soon)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Once a suitable game has
    been found, the action begins. <i>Tribes 2</i> is a fast paced, visceral
    action game. Though veering slightly away from the twitch-based approach to
    concentrate more on strategy and placement, <i>Tribes 2</i> takes the
    gameplay model built by the first one up a notch. Scores of new gameplay
    modes have been added: from standard Capture the Flag (CTF) and Capture and
    Hold (CnH), to the base Tribes II modes (both fairly self-explanatory), to
    Unreal Tournament-esque Siege.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">However, completely
    original and innovating modes have also been added. Bounty, a new variant on
    Deathmatch, gives each player a target to pursue. The player must kill only
    that target, for points, or the player currently hunting him. Another new
    type, Hunters, a hybrid between CTF and Deathmatch, involves players, or in
    the case of Team Hunters, teams, collecting flags dropped by killing
    enemies, and then returning them all to the Nexus for points. The more flags
    collected, the more points given when the flags are turned in.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic4.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> Rabbit, much
    like an all versus one game, is one of the most inventive of all game modes
    ever devised. In Rabbit, one player has the flag while everyone else tries
    to kill him. The longer he maintains control, the more points he receives.
    Despite being new, fresh, and innovating, many players seem stuck to the old
    favorites of CTF and CnH; and what a shame it is. Unfortunately, few servers
    have yet to adopt the newer gameplay modes, which often are the most fun.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">
    Also, though each category is well equipped with maps, many of them seem to
    be lackluster and somewhat uninspired. All games suffer from some maps that
    simply don't jibe, but what compounds the problem are the selection of maps
    that were chosen to be imported from the first game. Many old favorites,
    such as Broadside, my all time favorite map of any game, have been left out.
    My only hope is that some intrepid member of the fan community will take up
    the cause and bring old friends new life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">&quot;We need not choose
    war&quot;, but I do!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Regardless of the game type
    chosen, the core action is the same. Viewed through the first-person
    perspective, though third person is also available (Which is a huge
    help for situations involving piloting vehicles and aircraft.), and played on
    maps ranging in size from small to continental, <i>Tribes 2</i> is very much
    a tactical action game. With three different armor classes dictating the
    gameplay, there are near endless options and ways to play.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> Armor can be
    changed at any time, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
    Scout, or light armor, allows blazingly fast movement, but very low armor.
    Scouts are also very light, so they can stay in the air much longer than the
    others with the use of the jumpjets. Able to pilot any of the multitude of
    vehicles in the game, Scouts are also the sole users of sniper rifles. They
    are great for reconnaissance or evasionistic gameplay.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic5.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> Assault, or Medium
    armor, allows one more weapon to be carried than the Scout, for a total of
    four. Assaults have more armor, but are heavier and move more slowly. The
    Juggernaut, or Heavy armor, can carry five weapons, but moves incredibly
    slowly. Also, Juggernauts are the only of the three classes to be able to
    use the powerful Fusion Mortar, but cannot pilot any vehicles at all.
    Juggernauts are aimed specifically for stationary, turret-like gameplay.
    Each of the classes is perfectly balanced and incredibly different. Each has
    a strategy and play all its own.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">In addition to the classes,
    an enormous variety of weapons, as well as packs, add-ons to the armor, and
    vehicles are available. Weapons range from an Electron Flux Projector (ELF)
    to the famed Spinfusor, and each has its own purpose and strategy behind it.
    Nearly none of the weapons fire projectiles fast enough to hit the target
    dead on immediately. So they must be aimed and frequent interpolating of
    trajectories is required for accurate firing. Half educated guessing, half
    strategy based on the environment, each gun is a challenge to master.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> Adding
    immensely to the strategy of the game, players must guess as to where their
    target will be moving so as to actually manage to hit them. Deceptively hard
    to master, this type of gameplay can create nerve-wracking firefights among
    groups of players lasting for minutes. Also, each weapon has specific uses
    and very deliberate strategies to accommodate hugely varying styles of play.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Most weapons can take hours to truly develop and master which always
    leaves a new strategy to discover and a new weakness to exploit. Groups of
    mixed armors will usually win as they can take advantage of the weaknesses
    of the others, but players must work together, help each other, and combine
    their efforts to truly succeed. Having so many different combinations
    together creates not only incredible variety, but also a type of teamwork
    hard to find online. Regardless of the outcome, this is what Tribes was made
    for, and this type of combat is what drives the game, no matter how it is
    played.</font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic6.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Packs are add-on kits to a
    player's armor that improve or add a certain feature. For example, the Cloak
    Pack allows a player to become and move invisibly, though the pack eats
    energy extremely quickly. There are even scores of deployable packs
    available for players to go so far as to create their own minibase, or at
    the very least, to help defend and secure key locations.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> Notable also is
    Repair Pack, which allows players to repair other players, buildings, and
    vehicles. One can play the entire game as a &quot;Janitor&quot; who merely
    makes rounds repairing bases and turrets. On the subject, <i>Tribes 2</i>
    has an even wider range of vehicles. Now, Bombers with separate Tailgunners,
    Pilots, and passengers, as well as Tanks, with gunner and driver, add even
    more depth to the team atmosphere. However, since it's hard to communicate
    exactly what to do or where to go, the game often makes the player feel
    isolated, as if he or she is simply doing their own routine unable to
    interact with others. This, of course, is one of the major, elusive,
    problems of today's online games.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Vehicles are suspiciously hard to
    pilot with precision. For example, it is next to impossible to accurately
    shoot with the scout Fighter Shrike. Whether this was intentional or not is
    unknown, but this renders the combat effectiveness of the Shrike to almost
    nil. As an aside, I also would have preferred a greater weapon variety on
    some of the vehicles, namely the aforementioned Shrike. Having no air-to-air
    missiles at all, I relished the idea of midair dogfights, and was sorely
    disappointed to find no ability to do so at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">A Completely New Look?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">Despite the
    much-touted technical wizardry that has gone into the new <i>Tribes 2</i>
    engine, it doesn't look horribly new or different. In comparison to today's
    best, the <i>Tribes 2</i> engine features comparatively poor textures,
    simplistic architecture, and most of all, less bang for your buck. The hills
    and rolling landscapes are more realistic and curved, but at the same time,
    they sometimes seem drab and almost boring. The textures are somewhat
    generic, but they do convey the landscape well enough.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic7.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> The high point,
    however, are the special effects. These truly shine, and really create
    amazing immersion. They add a special awe factor to combat, and truly stress
    just how powerful everyone is. Also, the explosions, especially those of
    vehicles, deserve special praise. There's very little like the feeling of
    thankfulness and wonder that one gets as a jump is made at the last second
    out of a flying bomber the moment before it collides with 3 surface to air
    missiles. Looking back and seeing the bomber torn to bits, almost in slow
    motion, is simply breathtaking and humbling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">Puzzling, is the &quot;chuginess&quot; of the engine. Frequent pauses and rendering glitches occur even
    on P4 1.4 Ghz systems. Unable to be run in 32 bit, the game is simply a
    system hog. Adding insult to injury is the fact that the engine is not as
    amazing as it could be. It would be understandable if <i>Tribes 2</i> had
    the latest and greatest technical wizardry, but as it stands the game is far
    from it.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> Despite these engine slow downs <i>Tribes 2</i> does look good, and
    any game that can render as much action on screen, as well as simply being
    able to handle the vast outdoor terrain, deserves praise. Moreover, the
    realistic landscapes make the suspension of disbelief needed to be immersed
    in a game just that much easier to attain, but the frequent spurts of video
    lag summarily dismiss much of that.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">Aurally, the game delivers,
    although it is not groundbreaking. Explosions rumble, machinery whirrs, and to
    support it all is a fast moving, unobtrusive soundtrack. Though the tunes
    are not ones you'd likely find yourself humming, nor are they memorable,
    they do convey the tone of the game, as well as compliment the fast-paced
    action. They certainly aren't anything that will knock your socks off in delight,
    nor do they do anything particularly remarkable to the state of gaming music
    in general.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> I, for one, would have preferred a more thematic, orchestral
    approach. Truthfully, I liked the soundtrack from the original <i>Tribes</i>
    much more. On the other side, though, the sound effects are all perfectly
    recorded with meticulous care, and sound like they should.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">That's very high praise for
    sounds, believe me. Of interesting note, the music is
    presented in simply named MP3 files which not only allow for listening
    outside of the game, but also allow one to replace the music with your own
    when the provided soundtrack gets tiresome. (note: the Run Lola Run
    soundtrack fits the game perfectly, and worked as an outstanding action
    enhancer).</font></p>

    strategic shooter:&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> It succeeds through its deep gameplay, strategic
    situations and environments, as well as enormous depth and options.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> <i>Tribes
    2</i> promised to revolutionize multiplayer gaming:&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">It does build and
    improve upon an established gameplay concept, but does not offer much beyond
    a more thorough realization and expansion of the idea. However, the game
    does succeed in being immensely fun, addicting, and nearly endlessly
    replayable. <i>Tribes 2</i> is the realization of true 100 player-plus
    servers, and truly large-scale combat. However, it does not radically change the
    accepted concepts of team-based gaming.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"> Lastly, <i>Tribes 2</i> promised to
    take team-based combat to a new level:&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">Here, it both succeeds and fails.
    Laying the framework for team-based action through optional voice
    communication support and hot-keyed, menu speech, <i>Tribes 2</i> does not
    at the moment allow the level of planning, cooperation, and team effort as,
    say, we find in <i>Counter-Strike</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">Due to the massive field of play,
    it's often hard to coordinate with friends and it is even harder to form
    groups who can stay and work together. But, through the community support,
    mod-ability, and replayability, clans large enough to handle warfare on the
    Tribes scale could emerge. In the end, though, it takes much more effort
    than before to work as a team. And that, truly, is <i>Tribes 2's</i> biggest
    downfall, even though it never severely detracts from the fun.</font></p>
