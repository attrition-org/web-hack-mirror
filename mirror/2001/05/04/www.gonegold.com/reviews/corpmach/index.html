    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">Everything about playing
    Michigan-based Stardock's <i>The Corporate Machine</i> is like taking a trip
    back in time. The look, sound, and feel of the game makes it difficult not
    to think of the days of Intel's 386s, when playing a computer game was a new
    sort of diversion and when you could generally count on playing something
    stable, accessible, and most-importantly, fun.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">Of all the modern advances
    in gaming, it seems like 'fun' is the feature becoming hardest to find. Good
    computer gaming is about losing yourself in an adventure - it's about
    playing a <b><i>good</i></b> game. The joy doesn't come from revolutionary
    graphics, but from seeing a balanced and recognizable set of rules in
    action. It comes from playing a game that is friendly, fair and challenging.
    Seen with that half-nostalgic mindset, <i>The Corporate Machine</i> shines.
    If the modern player can put aside his bias toward new technologies (and put
    out of his mind the ennui that has become rabidly popular among modern
    gaming &quot;connoisseurs&quot;), he'll find, in The Corporate Machine, a
    rejuvenating and fresh diversion. He'll forget about if and how well his
    system is running and for perhaps the first time in a long time, he'll have
    a hearty amount of fun.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#ffcc00" size="4">How to Succeed in
    Business without Really Trying</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">A strong sign of what makes
    <i>The Corporate Machine</i> a successful and truly immersive game, is how
    it blends the traditional categories of interface, gameplay, and graphics,
    into a unified system. You can't discuss Graphics without explaining the
    Interface, and understanding Gameplay is inseparable from understanding the
    information the graphics convey. Explaining the scheme verbally is probably
    about four times more difficult than just letting the player have at it and
    though I can tell you what the game is about, it probably wont sound very
    fun. Only once you're at the keyboard, will the light come on and you'll
    find yourself nodding with an appreciative, &quot;Ah-ha&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic2.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The &quot;point&quot; of
    the game is to effectively run a business. You select a product to sell
    (cars, airplanes or computers, or download a soda pop schemata from
    Stardock's Web site), and then go about creating the distribution, marketing
    and engineering networks that will help you to monopolize the industry. As
    the game's motto succinctly puts it: &quot;Start a company. Take over the
    world.&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Since I've worked in what I
    consider to be the ugliest side of business, &quot;PR&quot;, I'm actually
    surprised that the very concept of <i>The Corporate Machine</i> didn't send
    my stomach on some Dow Jones-like bowel dive. Truthfully, even those who
    hate being a part of the Corporate Machine may find a great deal of pleasure
    in playing it out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The reviewer's copy of the
    game did not include a printed manual.&nbsp; [Actually, it did. As I was
    packing games to ship to reviewers, I left it on top of my filing cabinet
    instead of in the box. My apologies.] Instead, the player accesses the rules
    via a link at the game's Web site, bookmarked in the System directory during
    installation (For the curious, the manual can be found at this <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/machine">link</a>).
    Like the best intuitive games, however (think Civilization II), you don't
    need to read the rules.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Saving (Inter)Face</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"><i>The Corporate Machine's</i>
    wonderful ease of play is due in large part to the game's very
    straightforward interface, which integrates specified information with the
    main map. Noting that the map is divided into regions (either in a
    representative world map, the downloadable United States map, or in a
    fantasy land), almost every bit of information in <i>The Corporate Machine's</i>
    main view is color-coded. Icons toggle the color-coding to represent data
    like Market Share, Employee Quality, and Regional Sales, and as you might
    expect, brighter colors reflect positive activity while darker colors
    represent degrees of inactivity.</font></p>

        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">With so much of the game
    dependent on a clear look then, it's refreshing that the views provided are
    so clean. They're likely too clean in fact and too &quot;unpolished&quot;
    for gamers who are used to seeing their world in 32-bit. The play map can be
    understood in an instant but it's not an eye-popper and is in fact very
    DOS-like in its pixilated simplicity.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The other views provided,
    such as the research screen, plant and facility maps, feature graphics that
    are effectively rendered in a static, quasi-3D manner, like that of Age of
    Kings and admittedly, the two looks don't match well. Thankfully, the
    mismatched graphics do nothing to inhibit enjoyment of the game.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">You begin <i>The Corporate
    Machine</i> with a home base, a product, a salesman, and up to seven
    opponents (either computer or human). The game does require that you log
    onto <a href="http://www.stardock.net">Stardock.net</a> to play multiplayer
    games but after you've set-up or joined one, the play is exactly like single
    player versus computer games.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">You must research new
    territories before being able to send your salesman in and you must begin
    work immediately on both how to develop your product (and hiring the
    engineers to do so) and expanding your customer base. In the location
    management screen you can direct funds toward expanding or improving your
    facility to improve employee skills, morale, as well as the number of
    workers, marketers, and engineers available to you. <i>The Corporate Machine</i>
    must be set in a &quot;Right To Work&quot; sort of world, as employees are
    fired and hired at will.</font></p>

      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2"><i>The Corporate Machine</i>
    is a manager's dream, allowing the player to create and execute fairly
    complex plans to out-research, out-sell and outright defame the opposition.
    The opposition however, is equally skilled and provides a very literal run
    for your money. On the Beginner skill level, I found four opponents fairly
    easy to beat but just a skill level above that and six or seven hours of
    play later, I was still trying to whittle down the prominence of my one
    remaining opponent from our almost perfect 50/50 market split.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">Probably the greatest joy
    of <i>The Corporate Machine</i> is that these computer opponents are so well
    programmed as to put up such a challenge. The noticeable difference in AI at
    each level goes a long way in establishing the longevity of the game. <i>The
    Corporate Machine</i> can genuinely be compared to more traditional board
    games like Othello and Chess in that the game is no less rewarding the
    better you become.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">At more advanced difficulty
    levels there are no gimmicks to success, such as speedy mouse clicking or
    utilizing some sort of super-queue (though you are allowed to queue up to 5
    product enhancements in the research screen). You'll need to really master
    your game before being able to beat the Difficult level, let alone the
    appropriately ominous sounding &quot;Lots of Pain&quot; level. The ease at
    which head-to-head and computer-controlled games are merged almost
    guarantees a near-infinite variety of skill and experience levels to pit
    yourself against.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">A surprise and a treat was
    the quality of the music. I can't tell if it's MIDI or orchestrated, but
    it's very nice, relaxing and completely unobtrusive. If you attempt to build
    or research something when you have too few liquid assets, a woman's voice
    will politely admonish you: &quot;Not enough money.&quot; If you've seen
    David Swift's goofy but enjoyable musical (the title is one of the headers
    above) then you can probably picture this woman, too.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">The only bad sounds in the
    bunch belong to your salesmen, who, for some reason makes silly, <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~obiwan/72435213952ae.mp3">Alvin
    &amp; the Chipmunks</a> like squeaks. They actually say things like
    &quot;You're the boss,&quot; and &quot;Okaley-Dokaley,&quot; and I half
    expected them to chime in with &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; toward the end
    of every fiscal year.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">The Bottom Line</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#f0e0b0" size="2"><i>The Corporate
    Machine</i></font><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2"> won't be up
    for any Game of the Year awards, unless that year is 1988. There's just too
    much outdated in the graphics department for this game to seduce a wide
    following. And that's a genuine drag.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">The
    same schmucks who come home and want to forget about their nagging boss and
    their irritating coworkers are probably exactly the type of people who would
    enjoy a chance to take on the world with their notions of how a business
    should run. </font><font color="#f0e0b0" size="2"><i>The Corporate Machine</i></font><font face="Verdana" color="#f0e0b0" size="2">
    is a family diversion that most families will never hear about. That's sad
    enough to make you wish it really was 1988, when there was less on the store
    shelves to distract people from this very rewarding and enjoyable game.</font></font></p>
