    Studios</font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> has a hit
    on their hands with their first release - <i>Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns</i>.
    Based on the shine and polish evident in Kohan, it's hard&nbsp;to believe
    that </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.timegatestudios.com"><font face="Verdana" size="2">TimeGate</font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2">
    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">hasn't been making
    games for years. Much of the game's success may be attributable to its
    talented and experienced senior staff, many of whom have worked on an
    impressive array of games, including <i>Baldur's Gate</i> and the <i>Wing
    Commander</i> series, among others. <i>Kohan</i> finally takes RTS to new
    heights by bringing together elements of battle simulation, resource
    management and hero development - packaging it all with an excellent,
    extremely refined interface and impeccable attention to detail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">The Story</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"><i>Kohan's</i> story
    facilitates the tactics and strategy portion of the game, while the setting
    allows for unique units and an interesting game world. The Kohan are an
    immortal race whose idyllic civilization was destroyed by the forces of
    Shadow. Eons have passed and the Kohan race has returned to reclaim Khaldun,
    the lands that once belonged to their race.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Each Kohan is an immortal
    hero with special abilities and skills who is &quot;awakened&quot; upon
    activation of a golden amulet. You must lead the Kohan immortals and their
    armies against the Shadow and restore Khaldun to its former glory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Install, Manual &amp;
    Interface</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">I encountered no problems
    with the moderate sized 600 Mb install. The 55-page manual is informative
    and does a good job of describing the interface and gameplay essentials.
    Charts of unit statistics are included, but I would've liked more
    descriptive information about individual units since they are not your
    typical troll and dwarf variety.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">A reference card is also
    supplied which details hot key assignments and tech trees for each of the
    four races' building and unit types. <i>Kohan</i> has the most intuitive and
    useful interface I have seen in an RTS. The layout of menus and all
    information is functional, logically presented and complete. Mission load
    times are incredibly fast and keep you immersed in the gameplay.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">You can save whenever you
    want but hot-keys for quick saving and loading are strangely absent. Also, I
    do wish you were able to queue building orders within cities. These are my
    only gripes and overall I feel that </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.timegatestudios.com"><font face="Verdana" size="2">TimeGate
    Studios</font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"> should be
    congratulated for developing an intuitive, graceful and effortless
    interface.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"><i>Kohan</i> easily rates a
    95 in this category.</font></p>

    <p>
    <font size="2" color="#F0E0B0">In many ways, <i>Kohan</i> resembles a
    classic turn based strategy game such as Age of Wonders or the Heroes of
    Might and Magic series. You have hero-controlled armies that you move across
    the map to conquer the enemy hero and his armies. In addition, you control
    towns and cities that supply your hero with troops and resources. You can
    build outposts, as well as mines and as you explore the map, you can win
    over new cities, gain technologies and find more resources. Kohan does all
    these things very well, but streamlines resource management and city
    building in order to focus on the composition of your armies, strategy, and
    tactics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">In <i>Kohan</i>, you
    control numerous armies and a number of heroes, or Kohan. You&nbsp;gain
    access to more heroes as the campaign progresses and each hero has a unique
    story and background. Since they are immortal, they may be
    &quot;awakened&quot; after death, but lose any experienced gained. The
    heroes help personalize the game and it's fun to watch them advance through
    the campaign.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">All units in the game are
    grouped into companies, which you recruit and design to your liking.
    Companies are made up of a Captain or Kohan, four front line units and two
    support units, such as missile units and mages. You can use your heroes as
    fighting troops or you can command them to lead from behind the lines. The
    units you have available for company construction depend on your race, the
    technology level of the city, and any advanced discoveries you have
    made.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic4.jpg" width="300" height="225"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">You can make companies for
    specific duties, such as engineering or scouting, with there being literally
    hundreds of combinations of troops, resulting in unique company attributes.
    For example, using archers and clerics for support troops with a front line
    of heavy infantry will result in a lethal combination. On a higher level,
    you could also build a company of missile units to support a company or
    companies of melee units.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Orders available to
    companies include move, formation, retreat and rout. There are four
    formations available and they range from slow, but tough, combat formations
    to speedy, but weak, column formations. Companies can be further grouped to
    form regiments. The formation and facing of each company in a regiment can
    be locked in order to give tactical advantage to the larger formation. <i>Kohan</i>
    also seamlessly incorporates advanced ideas such as zones of control,
    supply, population and detection. The zones add a whole new level of
    strategy.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">For example, units
    regenerate when in supply and automatically attack enemies that cross into
    their zone of detection. In addition, zones of control and detection change
    based on the surrounding terrain. Buildings also have guard zones, which
    trigger the deployment of local militia. Finally, terrain, fortification
    level, and morale are also factored into combat. Though this may sound
    complex, companies, regiments, zones and more are all explained in simple
    terms in the tutorials. The whole system works very well and becomes second
    nature after your first campaign scenario.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Gameplay is real time but,
    like most everything in <i>Kohan</i>, game speed is highly adjustable and
    you can easily slow things down during heated battles and speed things up
    for resource gathering and exploring. <i>Kohan's</i> sixteen-mission
    campaign is well scripted and I looked forward to each new mission. The
    computer AI is relentless and provides a challenge even on normal difficulty
    level. Skirmish mode is also available, as well as a full-featured map
    editor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">As expected, playing with
    human opponents adds a whole new dimension to the game. <i>Kohan</i>
    supports up to 8 players with LAN, Internet connection and through <a href="http://asp.planetquake.com/redirect.asp?318">GameSpy
    Arcade's</a> free player matching service. Multi-player games are highly
    customizable and the politics lore allows you to make offers for peace,
    declare war, and ally with other players. There seems to be a decent sized
    community of gamers on GameSpy, and you can find several different clans
    posting on the <a href="http://www.kohan.net">Homepage</a> message boards.
    The games I played were great fun and I experienced no slow-downs or
    bugs.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Two thumbs up for a robust
    and full-featured multi-player experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Graphics</font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic6.jpg" width="300" height="239"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">As mentioned previously,
    the interface is very crisp and clean. The in-game&nbsp;movies are good but
    sparse, while mission briefings and other graphical&nbsp;interfaces are
    extremely functional and consistent throughout. The screen&nbsp;resolution
    is set to 1024 by 768 and <i>Kohan's</i> 2D engine looks excellent but
    unremarkable.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">The maps are attractive and
    have a decent amount of terrain variety, but I wished that they were a
    little more fanciful and imaginative. The units in your companies are
    distinctive and easily identifiable. In addition, unit animations are fluid
    and convincing. The animations for magic are particularly good and I found
    myself recruiting magic casting units in anticipation of watching the
    effects during combat. The towns and other structures change as they are
    improved or damaged and have distinctive characteristics for each race. <i>Kohan</i>
    doesn't break any new ground in terms of graphics, but everything is highly
    detailed, looks great and contributes to the excellent gameplay, earning <i>Kohan</i>
    a solid 88.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Sound and Music</font></p>
    <div align="right">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img border="0" src="pic5.jpg" width="300" height="239"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0"><i>Kohan's</i> music fits
    the game perfectly. The transition is managed very well when going to and
    from game menus and within the game itself. Voice acting is&nbsp;professional
    and with the exception of one race's voice, very well done.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">In-game sounds are
    appropriate but could be slightly better. Fighting sounds can be repetitive
    and unit acknowledgements are far too frequent (The latest patch corrects
    this. Kudos to </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.timegatestudios.com"><font face="Verdana" size="2">TimeGate
    Studios<br>
    </font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;for listening to the players
    of their game and responding in a timely manner. Lets hope this fledgling
    company maintains this level of support.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">).&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#F0E0B0">Overall, the game sounds
    are good enough to contribute to the&nbsp;gameplay and the epic musical
    score adds to your immersion in the game world. <i>Kohan</i> earns a
    respectable 85 in the sound and music department.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffcc00" size="4">Summary</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2"><i>Kohan: Immortal
    Sovereigns</i> is an outstanding game. While the concept of formations and
    zones is certainly not a new one, <i>Kohan's</i> implementation works
    perfectly. The interface is a work of art and the attention to detail
    throughout the game is commendable.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#F0E0B0" size="2">Most importantly,
    everything comes together to make <i>Kohan</i> a blast to play. If you are a
    fan of strategy games, you owe it to yourself to add <i>Kohan</i> to your
    collection.</font></p>
