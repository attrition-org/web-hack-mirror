    <small>The Food and Drug Administration today approved mifepristone (trade name Mifeprex)
    for the termination of early pregnancy, defined as 49 days or less, counting from the
    beginning of the last menstrual period. Mifepristone is a drug that blocks a hormone
    called progesterone that is needed for pregnancy to continue. Mifepristone, when used
    together with another medicine called misoprostol, is used to end an early pregnancy.</small><br>
