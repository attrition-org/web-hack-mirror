      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You've seen 
        the ads for all the different contests out there. Some promise fame for 
        the winners, others promise fortune. But how do you know which ones are 
        right for you? This month we decided to go right to the source, and interviewed 
        the organizers of Scriptapalooza, one of the new up and coming screenwriting 
        competitons (<a href="../resources/newsletters/08-00.html" target="_blank">article 
        taken from the August Screenplay Scoop newsletter</a>). (We actually liked 
        them so much that we'll be working with them for their 3rd Annual Competition 
        starting in October! More details to come...)</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Why are 
        there so many competitions out there and are they worth entering?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
        many competitions for a myriad of reasons and each affects
        whether they're worth entering. First, there are the top level
        competitions that truly facilitate the screenwriter's career with
        prestige, prizes and respect garnered from winning. Second, there are
        ones that are a tool for a production company to find new material.
        Third, there are those that see the large number of screenwriters out
        there and say, "hey, we can make some money off of these people." The
        latter, you obviously want to avoid. The scams tend to be fairly obvious
        with higher entry fees, less reputable people involved, or they're making
        promises that they cannot keep. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>What 
        should writers look for when selecting a competition?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
        most important things is if it fits the goals you want to
        achieve with your material. What do you want from the competition? Do 
        you
        want a big cash prize? Do you want your material read by the people
        behind the competition? Do you want to be considered by the particular
        production company associated with the competition? Does it offer
        anything to the runners-up? Does it offer "everything under the sun" with
        a high price tag to match? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Does it continue 
        to work for the winners once they are announced? Or do
        they announce winners, give the winning scripts to production companies
        and not do anything? The most important thing when selecting a
        competition is to do your homework. Don't be afraid to check out every
        aspect, from confirming its validity to seeing where past winners have
        gone. Keep in mind with the internet growing rapidly, many competitions
        will state things and list companies that are supposedly associated with
        their competition. They know that there is no "scam police" and that
        nobody will be the wiser. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>What 
        advice do you have for an aspiring writer who wants to enter a competition?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Make sure 
        your script is ready. We say this over and over. A "first
        draft," which is usually first words on paper draft and not really a true
        first draft, should not be submitted. Finishing a screenplay is a great
        accomplishment and very exciting. The first thing a writer usually wants
        is to send their masterpiece out. Get feedback from peers, teachers and
        associates on your script. Get notes and start looking for repeat issues,
        i.e., lost me in Act II, or Joe just doesn't seem sympathetic enough, 
        etc.
        You won't necessarily take what everyone has to say and make those
        changes, but you'll see patterns. Rewrite your script. After you have
        rewritten some more, this will be your first draft. Only then, I would
        suggest you submitting it to a screenwriting competition. Bottom line:
        competition is fierce and you must put your best work out there. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>What 
        is Scriptapalooza? What makes it different from the others?</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scriptapalooza 
        is a unique entity. Started in 1998, it has proven to be
        one of the best new entries on the competition scene. Scriptapalooza's
        main objective is to reach the untapped well of genuine screenwriting
        talent that hasn't been able to get their "foot in the door." Whether 
        it
        is due to lack of contacts or not being related to the "right people," 
        and
        help them move to the next level: Being paid to be a writer! Talent is
        the seed to success, but it's only the beginning. The barriers around 
        the
        Industry are fierce and breaking them takes more than talent. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is where 
        Scriptapalooza is different. We don't just stop with some
        cash and a pat on the back. Scriptapalooza takes its latest crop of
        outstanding writers, totaling 13 a year, and treats them like beauty
        queens as Scriptapalooza's winners for the entire year. Their work is
        read by some of the top Industry professionals, both production companies
        and literary representatives. They are hooked up with potential readings,
        talent, etc. The most valuable and often unattainable goal for an
        undiscovered writer is getting the script into the hands of someone who
        can do something with it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Please 
        describe the exposure your past winners have received.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
        set of 13 winners were initially exposed to our 18 core group of
        production companies and literary reps. Some of the writers had meetings
        and phone calls. In the first few months, we began getting many requests
        from top production companies and studios to read the winners' scripts.
        The 1999 1st Place Winner, Sean McElhiney, "Soul to Keep", is now working
        on a rewrite for UTA, United Talent Agency. The 1999 2nd Place Winner,
        Andrea Bailey, "Falling Over Venus", has been signed by Berg-Saccani
        Management and is meeting with Mary Stuart Masterson to direct. Andrea's
        script was chosen by Drama Garage for an "industry only" reading of her
        script. The evening resulted in a packed house. She is also currently
        working with Marc Platt Productions (American Pie, Josie and the
        Pussycats). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Runner Up, 
        "Schwinn Varsity" by Richard Eschenroeder and Andrew G. Smith
        have been signed by Bender-Spink Management and is having meetings with
        potential directors and has garnered interest from Dreamworks to possibly
        option the script. These are only the highlights. You can see the
        progress of all the winners and runners-up by visiting
        http://www.scriptapalooza.com and checking out the "recent headlines".
        There we list which script was requested and where it was sent. The 2000
        winners will be announced on August 15 and will be going out to 28
        production companies/literary reps as well as receiving cash awards,
        software and prizes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>How did 
        Scriptapalooza get started?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The genesis 
        for Scriptapalooza was fairly simple. Two of the partners 
        are writers, Genevieve Cibor and Kelli Bennett, and several years ago, 
        we
        became disheartened with the state of competitions available. The third
        partner, Mark Andrushko, was a producer at the time and realized how
        thirsty his company/literary contacts were for great material. Together,
        we changed the way competitions were ran and Scriptapalooza was born. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>When 
        does your next competition start?</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next 
        competition will open October 1, 2000 and will close April 16,
        2001. Winners will be announced August 15, 2001.</font></p>
