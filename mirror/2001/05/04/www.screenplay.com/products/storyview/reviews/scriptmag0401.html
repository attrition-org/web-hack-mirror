        you were to ask the guys at Screenplay Systems, Inc. about their latest 
        product, StoryView, they would tell you that "It's a remarkable new visual 
        outliner that lets writers brainstorm, create, structure, and organize 
        their ideas." Usually, I don't buy into the software developers' self-aggrandizing 
        hype; but it turns out they are being modest. For writers, this program 
        rocks!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../../../images/products/storyview/svbox_lg.jpg" width="140" height="158" align="right">StoryView 
        is a highly developed think pad for writers to lay out and organize their 
        thoughts and ideas on a limitless virtual corkboard. The program is designed 
        to let you be illogical in a logical manner and to think nonlinear in 
        a straight line. You don't have to be a techno-geek on a computer, and 
        the program takes up no wall space.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compared 
        to other outlining methods, such as 3x5" index cards or post-its, StoryView 
        is a roadster with a turbo-powered Bell-Jet Ranger Helicopter engine. 
        This program is so rich with features it borders on "over-load." The first 
        tour of StoryView feels like going rabbit hunting with a missile launcher. 
        In the beginning, it's somewhat disconcerting and disorienting. But once 
        you understand the ethereal concepts of the program, you can track your 
        most creative impulses and map them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The best 
        way to explain how StoryView works is to look at the movie <i>Pulp Fiction</i> 
        written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is a film 
        in which time is reshuffled non-sequentially. The opening is really the 
        beginning of the final act where two customers (Honey Bunny and Pumpkin) 
        in a coffee shop decide to rob the place. The middle of the story is really 
        the end for Vincent Vega when he gets killed. The final act brings Vega 
        back to finish the story which began at the opening of the film in the 
        coffee shop.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a very 
        sly move, the StoryView developers use <i>Pulp Fiction</i> as their tutorial 
        model which, in essence, is a metaphor for the program's application. 
        <i>Pulp Fiction</i> mirrors StoryView's ability to reorder events. The 
        premise of StoryView is based on the notion of a timeline. A screenplay, 
        for instance, can be laid out in minutes; a book, in pages. However, the 
        program is designed to work in a variety of media such as television, 
        radio spots, industrial video scripts, speeches, magazine articles, and 
        anything that can be measured in either time (minutes/seconds) or space 
        (pages/lines).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a highly 
        advanced outlining program, StoryView uses a system of hierarchies called 
        "events and elements." Think of it as parents with children. Let's say 
        a screenplay is broken down into three acts: beginning, middle and end. 
        The screenplay's hierarchy, or the parents, would be the "act." Below 
        that are the elements, or the children, called "sequences." The children's 
        children, called the "scenes" follow them. Each scene can be comprised 
        of yet another element called a "beat." Conceivably, the beats can be 
        reduced into smaller elements; and so it goes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using the 
        <i>Pulp Fiction</i> model for our example, the first event, Act I, has 
        the heading of "Vincent Vega &amp; Marsellus Wallace's Wife" followed 
        by some body text that describes what happens in the overall act, i.e. 
        "we follow the story through VINCENT VEGA's eyes that centers on his relationship 
        with hi boss's wife MIA&#133;"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next 
        element down (the sequence) is titled, "Vince &amp; Mia's Date" with the 
        description "Vince prepares himself for the worst before meeting the boss' 
        wife Mia. He's high on heroin when he meets her&#133;"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But wait, 
        Tarantino didn't open the story with Vince and Mia. He started with Honey 
        Bunny and Pumpkin discussing quitting the life of crime. Then they proceeded 
        to rob the coffee shop.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't know 
        if Tarantino wanted to start <i>Pulp Fiction</i> with the robbery. More 
        than likely he came up with the idea after a) he wrote the entire scene 
        of Honey Bunny and Pumpkin robbing the joint only to discover that there 
        were two other hit men in the restaurant which leads to a classic Tarantino 
        4-way standoff. Then b) he thought about breaking it up and putting the 
        beginning of the scene at the front of the movie and c) playing the rest 
        of the scene in the last act. Whichever way he came to that conclusion, 
        he did so by shifting and reordering the events until he found a through 
        line. If he had used StoryView, he might have found moving the scenes 
        of his story much easier.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sounds simple, 
        right? But there's more. Screenplay Systems added a monitoring device 
        called "tracks" to keep tabs on any piece of information within your story. 
        It gives you the ability to track anything from the practical: characters, 
        locations and plot points&#150;to the esoteric: actions, emotions and 
        relationships. The <i>Pulp Fiction</i> example tracks every character 
        in every scene, from Vincent Vega to "the Gimp."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Screenplay 
        Systems seems to inherently understand that all of us have our own unique 
        way of doing things. Some of us like to work from front to back, and others 
        like to work from back to front. StoryView is adaptable to just about 
        anybody's learning style. There are various buttons, toggles, and keyboard 
        commands that allow you to manipulate, add and subtract events and elements 
        to your story. There are also horizontal and vertical scale bars that 
        stretch and shrink your timeline with the performance of a slinky.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like Tarzan 
        swinging from vine to vine, you can work inside one element, then go clear 
        across the entire breadth of your timeline to another element. Once you 
        get the handle of these slider bars, they become your best friends. With 
        just a couple of mouse clicks, you can go from "Vince &amp; Mia's Date" 
        to "The Bonnie Incident" where Vincent and Jules have to dispose of a 
        dead body. StoryView customization capabilities are awesome. The program 
        starts you off with a variety-pack of simple templates which can cover 
        most common uses such as screenplays (various formats), novels, teleplays 
        and stage plays. But you can easily design your own templates in about 
        two seconds. What is notable, however, are the variations on the theme. 
        If you're developing a TV spot or a corporate video which uses a side-by-side 
        format, you can lay out the audio and the video as separate events. Included 
        in the application's examples is a Tiger Woods television commercial that 
        is an excellent model to demonstrate how to set up a template for your 
        personal needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, 
        I am writing a book about screenplay writing because the world needs another 
        book on the subject. It's called I Can Write A Better Movie Than That. 
        My book will contain chapters of grave importance on the art of procrastination. 
        There will be fun exercises to do and even a sample script. I created 
        my own template breaking down each section into chapters and each chapter 
        into paragraphs. After laying my book out in StoryView, I discovered that 
        I had lots of practical info but plenty of gaping holes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What I got 
        most out of the StoryView experience is a new way of writing. In the past, 
        I usually worked up some sort of rough outline in a Word file, then broke 
        the outline down into 3x5" scene cards which were pinned to a wall. As 
        I played around with StoryView, I did not fully realize the size and scope 
        of the <i>Pulp Fiction</i> tutorial model until I imported it into Word. 
        It was freakin' 45 pages of detailed description! It was then that I appreciated 
        StoryView's true brilliance. This program lets you explore concepts no 
        matter how far-fetched or unrelated to one another, and twist them around 
        in a plethora of combinations. You can work up as many ideas and be as 
        descriptive as you want. When you want to finally write that screenplay 
        or book or speech in a work processing form, a lot of your work is already 
        done. The StoryView file simply transfers itself into a rich text format 
        (rtf) and can be read into any word processing program.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like me, 
        Screenplay Systems is also shameless with its self-promotion. Dramatica, 
        their story development software program, can be imported into StoryView. 
        Although it easily (albeit grudgingly) lets you export a StoryView document 
        into any screenwriting program such as final Draft, it has a dedicated 
        button that will take you directly into its own Movie Magic Screenwriter 
        2000.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It does take 
        a little getting used to the inner-workings of the program. It can be 
        somewhat clunky at first. I think the developers should have offered two 
        levels of performance: Idiot and Tarantino. It is not that the program 
        is so complicated. It is fairly straightforward, and one could go from 
        idiot to Tarantino in a heartbeat. However, the learning curve of the 
        user does take some adjustment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hardest 
        part of writing is facing the blankness of a page. StoryView is an incredibly 
        flexible creative tool that allows you to brainstorm within the vast regions 
        of your imagination without constraint. You can leap from notion to thought, 
        marry image to vision, and fold concept into reality. What StoryView does 
        best is help you get it together.</font></p>
