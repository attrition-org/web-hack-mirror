Developed by Howard M. Gluss, Ph.D. from graduate courses he has taught on the nature of psychological portrayals in film and refined through private consultation, REEL PEOPLE gives you a way to "psychoanalyze" characters and in the process make them come to life.

			Dr. Gluss' valuable background in both the arts and psychology <img src="images/qu_02.gif" border="0" align="right">has made him invaluable on matters of not only story and character, but the very nature of the creative process. Because of this, Dr. Gluss has been called upon by directors, writers, actors and producers to assist in bringing to life their most inspired creations. Now, for the first time, the insights of both Dr. Gluss' private consultations and the soon-to-be-published book can be yours...here on the web!
