China &quot;kiddies&quot;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what do we have here? A security Company? I think so. HAH. Does this show
you something? It does me. China &quot;hackers&quot; or like I owuld like to
call them, China's &quot;kiddies&quot; need to step the fuck back befor they get
knocked the fuck back. I'm not playing with you. Maybe orion.com.cn has rebooted
their webserver now. And found out just how owned they are. Opps, I think they
have. They need a bit of security also. Anyone want info about that company? or
any other comapnys I have owned? I have stolen information I can use, and I have
destroyed what I have left behind. Now, do I fear all these China kiddies
sending me hate mail? Nope don't think so. Maybe they need to check the reply.
Oppsss, signature file. Ha, custom built trojan. To bad I usily end up
&quot;echo y| format /q c:&quot;... Also, want to speak about domination? lets
just /join #cnhonkers for a min. opps, I have been taking them out one by one.
Now, who is being dominated? I own &quot;big red&quot; I school the cnhonkers.
HUC has no chance.&nbsp;<br>

*Note* anyone else other than the china kids that have sent hate mail saying
&quot;i fuck you mother&quot;. Don't worry, I am not after you, your very
welcome to contact me anytime you want. Even if you don't believe what we are
doing is right, your very welcome to e-mail... <i>Yes I included an example
e-mail. *smiles*<br>
</i>I was also just thinking, you china admins, sometimes make it way to easy.

  Dear China,<br>
        We're sorry that you don't train your fighter pilots better. As a token of our apology, here's a
        copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000.(Please take note of the
        Copyright)
        <p>We're sorry that you're front-line fighter planes  can't outmaneuver a 35 year old prop-driven
        airliner. Perhaps you'd  like to consider purchasing some surplus 1950's
        era Lockheed Star Fighters from Taiwan. (We just replaced all theirs with shiny new
        F-16's).</p>
        <p>We're sorry his aircraft recognition skills were  so poor he didn't realize the EP-3 aircraft was
        propeller driven and flew his aircraft through its propeller arc, destroying
        his aircraft and nearly  killing 24 American crewmen.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We're sorry that you believe your territorial  waters extend all the way to Australia. For
        future reference, here's an  American 6th grade geography textbook. (Please
        take note of the  Copyright information printed inside the cover.)</p>
        <p>We're sorry we have to fly surveillance missions  to monitor a country that has nuclear missiles
        pointed at us.
        <p>We're sorry your fighter pilot's survival  training and equipment was so inadequate that he
        couldn't survive until your  poorly trained and equipped navy could find
        him
        (they turned down  our offer for search and rescue assistance).
        <p>We're sorry you violated international law and arrested the crewmen of an aircraft that legally
        diverted into your airfield under emergency conditions caused by your pilot's actions.
        <p>We're sorry you violated international law and boarded a state aircraft.
        <p>We're sorry that you can't seem to see your part of this incident. We know that it may seem easier
        to blame others than  to take responsibility.  Consider this fact while we  build several new Aegis destroyers for our friends in
        the Republic of  China (Taiwan).
        <p>We're especially sorry for treating you with such  respect for the last 20 years. We will definitely
        rethink this policy and probably go back to treating you like a common, untrustworthy  street gang very soon.
        <p>We're very sorry for ever granting you Most- Favored-Nation trading status and supporting your
        entrance into the  World Trade Organization. This will be rectified at the soonest
        possible  opportunity.
        <p>We're sorry the world is now seeing you for the enemy of freedom, truth, and democracy that you
        really are.
        <p>We're sorry you see yourself as a superpower when in reality you are a third world nation (the
        average Chinese worker  earns less than 10 cents a day).
        <p>We're sorry you are losing so much face over this.
        <p>We're sorry that you were able to steal missile  and nuclear secrets from us.
        <p>We're sorry you haven't learned from the Soviet  Union's collapse and failed to embrace democracy
        and capitalism  (compare tiny Taiwan and mainland China; same people, same culture,
        but Taiwan's  capitalistic economy is a powerhouse and China's economy is still
        mired in communism).
        <p>And most of all, we're sorry for the Chinese  people who suffer its leaders' incompetence.<br>
        <br>
