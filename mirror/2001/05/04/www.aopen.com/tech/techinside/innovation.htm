<font size="2" face="Arial">All conductors resist the flow of current 
to some extent and in order to eliminate resistance to minimum, a most economical 
way to reduce resistance is to make conductor as efficient as possible by providing 
so-called ''conduit'' to channel the current flow. Resistance also creates heat 
and it has to be reduced to a controllable level. What AOpen engineers are doing 
is to provide a better path to reach optimum power route to efficiently deliver 
power (both voltage and current) to destination without creating heat that's normally 
accompanied by high current with resistance during the journey.</font></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph" align="left"> <span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">In a typical motherboard  
  design, there are 4 layers of copper for the entire circuitry where both VCC  
  and ground are sandwiched between solder side and component side. In the older  
  generation motherboard when bus speed and component numbers are low, it is quite  
  sufficient, but as the performance of today's personal computer has reached  
  to PC133 and operating over 1GHz in CPU speed, the old method seems to be crippled  
  by dilemma. Today's motherboard design faces challenge of providing fast speed  
  with low noise that is detrimental to the system stability. In order to provide  
  every critical part of circuitry within the PCB, AOpen deploys a new design  
  concept called 'Power Bridge'. These bridges are strategically place within  
  the motherboard design that provides both voltage and current to a targeted  
  PCB region. This extra power is so pure that it contains no inherit noise when  
  travel through VCC and ground plane. Further, since the extra power is via 'Power 
Bridge', PCB VCC and Ground will have lesser current flow through and lesser  
  thermal problem.</font></span></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">AOpen has found a way to dramatically 
improve overall system stability by having both clock generator and power circuitries 
modify to achieve highest possible stability. By using Vishay military-grade resistors, 
AOpen engineers are able to eliminate clock error (jitter) down to omit level. 
Clock stability is so crucial that it can be attributed to system crush, hang 
and blue screen under Windows environment.&nbsp; </font>

resistor that its tolerance is less than 0.05% within the operational temperature 
from 5 to 85 degrees Celsius. This deployment of Vishay wire-wound resistors are 
so crucial to Overclocking the motherboard when CPU Vcore can be adjusted to meet 
requirements.&nbsp; </font>
