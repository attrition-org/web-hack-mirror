<p>Wake up, American people! DEAR AMERICAN PEOPLE, As people who love peace, we strongly 
sugguest American people try your best to stop US government from destroy the peace of the 
world. </p>

<p>&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;Few weeks ago, US goverment sent war plane to China and 
bumped our plane down to the sea. We lost one young people. When US invader came to our 
airfield, we didn't shoot it down. We cherish the peace of the world. But we are not 
afraid of war to protect our country. We know most people in the world cherish the peace 
of the world. But US goverment doesn't. PLS think about how many country it has invaded in 
recent years. How many lifes has been lost because of the invasions! Will this 
arbitrariness bring good to US people? No other country like it. It's just like relation 
between people. If a people is welcomed by others, his chance of success is much higher 
than those who are disrelished. Besides economic problems, it may lead you to war. It has 
bring wars to you. You don't feel the pain because you don't lose much. But wars between 
large countries will bring disaster to both country people. As people who love peace, we 
strongly sugguest US people try your best to stop US government from destroy the peace of 
the world. <br>
