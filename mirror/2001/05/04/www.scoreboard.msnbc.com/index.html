The Web site <a href="http://www.scoreboard.msnbc.com">http://www.scoreboard.msnbc.com</a>
is run on server farm therefore, to catch the defacement we had to continually reload the page.

As of 8:30am ET on May 4, 2001, the defaced page was still accessible by reloading the site
until it appeared.

This is Attrition.org's first recorded defacement of MSNBC.com.
