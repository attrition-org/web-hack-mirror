<b>EVALUATION.</b><p>
The University conducts quarterly evaluations of student progress, taking into consideration the minimum GPA allowable, the minimum successful units completion (% of courses attempted) and the percent of maximum time frame allowable.  Students who complete their programs in a shorter time framework are subject to the same criteria based on the percentages of maximum time frame allowable.<p>

The following Standards of Satisfactory Progress apply to all undergraduate and graduate students in the degree programs.  Students must meet the minimum standards set forth below, or they shall be deemed to be out of compliance in meeting the Standards of Satisfactory Progress criteria. <p>

<b>Minimum Academic Achievement</b><p>

<b>Baccalaureate:</b><p>

Students must achieve cumulative grade point averages (CGPAs) of the following: 1.25 at 25% of the maximum time frame; 1.5 at the midpoint of the maximum time frame; and a 2.0 at the maximum time frame.  A student whose CGPA is below 1.5 at 50% of the maximum time frame is not eligible for probation and will be suspended for one quarter.  Failure to maintain 2.0 for any quarter will result in being placed on probation.<p>  

<b>Master's Degree:</b><p>

Students must achieve cumulative grade point averages (CGPAs) of the following: 2.25 at 25% of the maximum time frame; 2.5 at the midpoint of the maximum time frame; and a 3.0 at the maximum time frame.  A student whose CGPA is below 2.5 at 50% of the maximum time frame is not eligible for probation and will be suspended for one quarter.  Failure to maintain 3.0 for any quarter will result in being placed on probation. <p> 

<b>Academic Probation</b><p>  

Students who do not maintain satisfactory progress will be placed on probation for one quarter.  The student on probation will be counseled and given assistance, if needed, in order to improve his/her GPA.  At the end of the one quarter probationary period, if the academic record is not in compliance with the standards of satisfactory progress, the student will be suspended for minimum of one quarter.  The student is considered to be maintaining satisfactory progress while on probation and will be eligible for Title IV aid, federal financial aid or loans.<p>

<b>Dismissal and Extended Enrollment</b><p>

Students who have been dismissed due to the failure to maintain the academic minimums outlined above may apply to continue their studies at PSU in an extended enrollment status.  During this time, the student is not eligible to receive federal financial aid or loans and must attempt to improve the deficient areas that led to the dismissal by taking remedial courses, retaking courses they failed, or practicing previously learned skills in order to re-establish satisfactory progress.  The student will be responsible for all cost incurred during this quarter.  At the completion of this quarter, a student who has established satisfactory progress according to the above tables may apply to the administration to return to a regular student status and reinstate their eligibility for financial aid.  A meeting will be scheduled between the University Dean and the student applying for reinstatement to determine if the student has the academic ability and desire to successfully continue in the program.  If reinstated, the student will be placed on probation for a period of one quarter.<p>

<b>Mitigating Circumstances</b><p>  

The dean may waive the standards of academic progress standards for circumstances of poor health, family crisis, or other significant occurrence out side the control of the student.  These circumstances must be documented by the student to demonstrate that they had an adverse impact on the student's performance.  No waivers will be provided for graduation requirements.<p>

<b>Appeals </b><p>

Should a student disagree with the application of these satisfactory progress standards, he/she must first discuss the problem with the appropriate instructor(s).  If still dissatisfied, the student may then appeal to the University Dean.
Readmission<p>

Students who have been dismissed from the University must wait two (2) quarters before applying for readmission and must submit a Petition for Readmission to the University Dean.  The Petition must include the records of any academic work successfully completed at other institutions as well as present compelling reasons for reinstatement which include the ability to maintain Standards of Satisfactory Progress.  The University Dean will notify the students in writing concerning their readmission.  If readmission is granted, students may resume course work at Pacific States University.<p>

<b>Reinstatement</b><p>

Students who leave the University without filing a Request for Leave of Absence will not be automatically reinstated.  Students must file a Petition for Readmission to a degree program which have the recommendations of the Director of his College.  It must be submitted to the Admissions Office.  Upon reinstatement students will be subject to all of the current requirements for the degree in effect at the time of reinstatement.<p>

<b>Leave of Absence</b><p>

Students, in good standing and making satisfactory progress towards a degree, who must interrupt studies for compelling reasons (e.g. which may include but not be limited to personal illness, unusual family responsibilities, military service, and unexpected consequences arising in their homeland.) must file a Request for Leave of Absence, usually not to exceed four (4) quarters.  Students must file this Request with the Admissions Office and have approval from the University Dean.

During the leave of absence a student is not entitled to assistance from the faculty or use of University facilities.  If granted, the leave is recorded on the student's transcript. The period of leave is not counted in the time allowed for the completion of degree requirements.  

Students who do not return to enrolled status at the end of the approved leave of absence is no longer considered to be pursuing a degree.  Students who fail to apply for a Request for Leave of Absence or for whom a leave has been denied or has expired should refer to Readmission.<p>
