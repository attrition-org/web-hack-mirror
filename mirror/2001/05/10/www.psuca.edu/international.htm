<b><font color="#ff0000">PSU</font></b> is authorized under Federal Law to enroll non-immigrant alien students and to issue Certificates of Eligibility (Form I-20) enabling students to enter the U.S. with a student visa (F-1).  Every effort is made by the PSU faculty to help students adjust to academic life in the U.S., particularly if English is the student's second language.<p>

The application and financial statement required of international students must be submitted on forms available from the Admissions Office. An official transcript must be submitted.  A non-refundable application fee of US$100 must accompany the admissions application.  Students applying for the Doctor of Business Administration program must submit an application fee of $150. Once an application  and  all   supporting     documentation   have   been   received  by the Admissions Office, approximately three to four (3-4) weeks should be allowed for processing.<p>

To receive the earliest consideration, an applicant requiring an F-1 visa should submit an application and supporting documents according to the following schedule:<p>

<b><font color="#ff0000">PSU</font></b> will not issue a Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20) until the student has been admitted and has been financially certified by the University.<p>

Applicants whose native language is other than English should have a score of 450 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), or a comparable test score, and send their scores to PSU's Admissions Office. Students whose TOEFL score or equivalent test score is less than 450 will not be permitted to enroll in any degree program.  Such students are encouraged to enroll in PSU's English as a  Second Language (ESL) Institute to meet the language requirement.  The equivalency test of the TOEFL will be administered by the English as a Second Language Institute.<p>

Students whose TOEFL or equivalent test score range is close to the required minimum may be given permission by the University Dean to enroll in a limited degree program while improving their English skills in by taking an advanced ESL course.<p>

International Students who have earned their undergraduate degree from an institution in which English was the main medium of instruction do not have to present a TOEFL score and will be excused from the equivalency test.<p>
