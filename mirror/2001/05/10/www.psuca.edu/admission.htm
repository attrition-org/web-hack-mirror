<a name="undergraduate"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
<b>Undergraduate Admission from High School</b></font></a><p>
<ol>
<li><b>GENERAL CRITERIA</b><p>

	To be admitted, a high school graduate must have the following:<p>
	<ul>
	<li>A high school diploma from an accredited school or equivalent.
	
	<li>A minimum score of 790 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or a minimum score of 16 on the American College Testing (ACT) for English-speaking students.  In considering these scores, the University will also evaluate the student's high school Grade Point Average (GPA), curricular records, and other documents to determine entrance eligibility. 
	
	<li>At a minimum, one (1) year of algebra, one (1) semester of geometry and trigonometry, and one (1) semester each of chemistry and physics for high school students applying for the BSCS degree.
	</ul><p>
	
	* Students must understand that full matriculation may be contingent upon completion of specified prerequisites.<p>

<li><b>TITLE V CLASS REQUIREMENTS</b><p>

California law prescribes as requirements for bachelor's degrees that each student demonstrate competence in understanding (1) American history, institutions, and ideals, (2) The Constitution of the United States, and (3) the principles of state and local government as established in California.<p>

Students may meet these requirements by completing specified courses under the General Education requirements.<p>


<li><b>ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENTS</b><p>

To undergraduate English-speaking students, the University will administer a skills test in English and Mathematics for appropriate placement.  Students who have an SAT score of 1200 or greater or an ACT score of 27 or greater are exempt from the test. The University will counsel students in Academic Improvement classes, AI100, AI105, AI110, and AI115 on a Credit (CR) and No Credit (NC) basis if their scores are below college level standards.  These classes do not count toward the baccalaureate. <p> 

All English and Mathematics proficiency tests are given on a quarterly schedule to which students should refer.<p>


<li><b>ADMISSION WITH ADVANCED STANDING</b><p>

An applicant may receive credit for up to forty-four (44) credits earned in high school Advanced Placement courses. Completed courses are accepted credit-for-credit for equivalent courses at PSU if the student has earned a score of three (3) out of a possible five (5). Evaluation and approval will be made by the University Dean and become a permanent part of the student's academic file.<p>
</ol>

<a name="graduate"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
<b>GRADUATE ADMISSION</b></font></a><p>

Students will be admitted to the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) program if their undergraduate GPA is 2.50 or greater for courses taken in the last ninety (90) quarter units of their undergraduate program.  M.S. students must supply proof that they have completed a bachelor's degree in physics, engineering, computer science, or applied mathematics from a recognized school.  An exception may be made for students who present clear and compelling evidence of their current capacity for satisfactory performance in such a program.<p>

<a name="english"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
<b>ENGLISH LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT</b></font></a><p>

For degree programs. Applicants for degree programs whose native language is other than English must have a score of 450 (paper based)/133 (computer based) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), and send their scores to PSU's Admissions Office.  For students who have not taken TOEFL but need a score to meet the admission requirement, PSU will administer the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) and the Listening Comprehension Test (LCT) which are tests comparable to the TOEFL. Students whose TOEFL score or equivalent test score is less than 450 will not be permitted to enroll in any degree program.  Such students are to enroll in PSU's English as a Second Language (ESL) program to meet the language requirement.<p>

Students applying for the non-degree English as a Second Language program will take the Michigan English Proficiency Test (EPT) to establish their level of competency: beginning, intermediate, or advanced.<p>

International students who have earned their bachelor's or master's degree from an institution in which English was the main language of instruction do not have to present a TOEFL score and will be excused from the equivalent test.<p>





<b><a name="tuition"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
TUITION AND OTHER FEES</font></a></b><p>

All tuition and fees must be paid on or before the first day of the program.  Refunds are made in accordance with university policy.<p>

PSU has a very competitive tuition and fee schedule which most students find affordable.  Students should contact PSU for the most current tuition fees which may vary from quarter to quarter.<p>

Although PSU does not maintain residence halls, there is a wide choice of living accommodations, depending upon the need and financial resources of the individual. <p> 

The University endeavors to assist students in finding suitable quarters which include nearby apartments and residence hotels.  These may be engaged at a moderate monthly cost, in some cases including two meals a day.  <p>

The area has hundreds of inexpensive restaurants, many of them fast-food chains.  Food costs per month are within an affordable range for city living.  Many students live in family environments where the costs may be considerably less.<p>
