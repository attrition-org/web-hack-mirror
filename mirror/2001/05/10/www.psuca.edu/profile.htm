Pacific States University has a long and distinguished history. Founded in 1928 as an independent private institution, it has provided a comprehensive education in the fields of business, engineering, and computer science to more than 10,000 graduates.  Located in Los Angeles it offers classroom and field-based learning opportunities designed to prepare students for preparation in their professional fields of choice.  <p>

The student body, drawn from the United States and some 40 other countries, works together with a distinguished faculty, many of whom have international origins.  Facilities include modern classrooms, computer laboratories with Internet access, and an extensive collection in the University Library.  <p>

PSU programs are uniquely suited for overseas students who can complete their degrees at a pace that fits their careers and personal schedules.  Classes are offered during the day, in the evenings, and on Saturdays.  Many students accelerate their course work by taking advantage of the summer quarter. <p>

Undergraduate students may complete their programs in three years if they enroll four quarters per year on a full-time basis.  Graduate students may complete their degrees in one year or less if they have met prerequisite requirements.  The academic year has four eleven-week quarters.<p>

As a multi-purpose professional institution all the key ingredients for student success are in its programs: <p>

<ul>
	<li>Small classes
	<li>Experienced and well-educated faculty
	<li>Available computer laboratories with Internet access
	<li>Extensive collections through the University Library
	<li>Location in a major metropolitan area with global markets
	<li>Stimulating study exchanges with students from a multi-cultural background
</ul><p>

Students will enjoy Southern California's yearlong outdoor living climate, remarkable especially for its sun-drenched winters.  Oceans, mountains, and deserts supply a background of endless beauty in which to work, study, and play.  <p>

A multi-cultural population lives, works, and dreams in the City of the Angels surrounded by smaller cities, suburbia, and rural California. Entertainment opportunities abound: many professional and collegiate sports teams, amusement parks like Disneyland, zoos with fabulous exhibits, a host of museums, many theaters and movie houses, symphony orchestras, opera companies and all kinds of contemporary music groups.<p>
