The Pacific States University Library houses more than 14,800 volumes and regularly receives about 65 periodicals. Special effort is made to maintain the collection in the areas of business, computers, and electronics. The library is managed by a professional librarian and a part-time assistant librarian. It is open forty-eight (48) hours a week.<p>

PSU has undertaken an ambitious project to computerize its services. A recent addition has enabled PSU to subscribe to the UCLA Orion computer program, which makes an online search of the entire bibliography at that university available to PSU students. Through either the Inter-Library Loan Program or courtesy usage of the UCLA library facilities, PSU students can obtain requested materials.<p>

Several other local libraries have cooperative programs with no-charge, online searches that PSU students can access from the PSU library computers.  These include the library at California Institute of Technology, the Santa Monica Public Library, the Torrance Public Library, and the Palos Verdes Library District.  The Los Angeles Public Library soon will also have such a program.<p>

The PSU Library currently has the beginnings of an extensive CD ROM collection that will bolster the library's ability to support PSU's instructional program. At present, the CD ROM subscription service has a title database of more than 220,000 titles, many of which have direct application to the degrees and programs offered at PSU.<p>

The PSU Library also provides access to the Internet and other online information systems. These information superhighways have revolutionized study and research opportunities in higher education and have made a tremendous number of resources available to PSU students. The Los Angeles Public Library, home to the largest research collection west of the Mississippi River, provides each PSU student with a library card to its main library and forty-one (41) branches. These unparalleled resources open the larger world of education to PSU students without negating the many advantages of study in a small university.<p>

<b>Library charges:</b><p>

1.	Overdue books are charged US$1 per day beyond their due date; overdue reserved materials are charged US$2 per day. Charges are subject to annual revision and administrative waiver.<p>

2.	Borrowers who lose or damage library materials are charged with<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>The replacement cost of the materials.
<li>The amount of fine incurred up to the time the material is reported missing is equal to 100% of the book value.
<li>A service charge of US$20 for each title.
</ol><p>

When a lost book for which the borrower has been billed is returned before a replacement has been ordered, a refund not exceeding the replacement cost may be made. In case a replacement has been ordered, any refund to the borrower is at the discretion of the University Librarian.<p>

<center><b><a name="computer">COMPUTER LABORATORY</a></b></center><p>

The Computer Laboratory helps students write, rewrite, edit, and debug computer programs. It uses a variety of computers and printers: twenty (20) personal computers; nine (9) dot matrix printers. The computers are connected to one file server using a network operating system. The software includes business applications, word processing, spreadsheets, programming languages, database management, and tutorials.  The CLC also provides access to the Internet and other online information systems.<p>

The Coordinator of the Computer Learning Center is available to assist students.<p>


<center><b><a name="laser">LASER LABORATORY</a></b></center><p>

The Cooper-Loeb Laser Laboratory was dedicated in November, 1991 and now houses two sets of laser equipment donated by Trimedyne Inc., Irvine, CA., a manufacturer of medical electronics equipment.<p>

The first of these, a model Optilase (tm) 900 Argon Laser, a 12 watt Blue-Green Argon system was installed in 1991 with suitable 3-phase power and water cooling systems.<p>

The second system, a Holmium: Yag Laser was installed in the laboratory in 1993.<p>

The Laboratory is used for the activities associated with Pacific States University courses and is also available for use under Pacific States University supervision, by other schools.<p>



The ESL program is designed to meet the language needs of international students and residents of the Los Angeles community. (See Admission Information, for a description of this program.) The ESL Learning Laboratory is open in relation to class hours and by student appointment.<p>
