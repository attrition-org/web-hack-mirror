<a name="1"><b>ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE (ESL) PROGRAM</b></a><p>
PSU's ESL program is designed to meet the language needs of students and residents of the Los Angeles community whose native language is not English.  Those who participate in the program receive intensive training focused on the development of communicative skills -- listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  Incorporated within the ESL program is the study of the English sound system, lexicon, grammar, and American culture.

Students in preparation for PSU's degree programs may participate in the ESL program to strengthen their English skills.  Other students participate to prepare for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) examination so that they may study at other schools in the United States.  Business people in the community take part to develop good business communication skills, which include understanding the American business culture.  In general, people participate so that they will be able to function well within the English-speaking community.
<p>

<a name="2"><b>ESL PROGRAM offers</b></a><p>
PSU offers a quality program in English as a Second Language (ESL).  The program has three levels of study, each specifically aimed at improving both written and oral expression.  Students receive a solid foundation in English that prepares them for academic success and fluency in conversation.  The three levels are offered 18 hours per week on a quarterly basis (11 weeks): <p> 

<ul>
<li>EN001  Beginning Level in English as a Second Language<br>
<li>EN002  Intermediate Level in English as a Second Language<br>
<li>EN003  Advanced Level in English as a Second Language<p>
</ul>

Students who complete the advanced level (EN003) receive a Certificate of Achievement.<p>

In addition to the basic ESL program, PSU also offers 2 non-credit courses, 4 hours per week on a quarterly basis (11 weeks):<p>
<ul>
<li>EN004   Preparation for English Proficiency Test<br>
<li>EN005   Business English<p>
</ul>

All ESL courses are taught by native English speakers using creative techniques to make the learning process enjoyable. Whether the student's goal is cultural exploration, advanced academic pursuits, or proficiency within the business world, PSU can help the student succeed.<p>

Classroom instruction is augmented by field trips, activities in the ESL Learning Laboratory, and the opportunity for the students to share their views and experiences with classmates from around the world.  These multi-cultural exchanges are a major strength of PSU's highly successful ESL program.  Students learn more than a language; they learn about others and about American traditions and customs.<p>

<a name="3"><b>INSTRUCTORS</b></a><p>
ESL instructors at PSU have advanced degrees and practical training in applied linguistics, language acquisition, and second language teaching. This means that your ESL instructors are familiar with and prepared to work with your special needs in learning a second language.  All ESL instructors have studied foreign languages; many have lived abroad and many have been international students themselves at one point of their lives, so they can identify with many of your common language acquisition difficulties and are, therefore, in a better position to help you. <p>

<a name="4"><b>COURSE CONTENT</b></a><p>
Anticipating what your non-native reading, vocabulary, grammar, listening, speaking, and writing concerns are, ESL instructors will prepare the course materials so that they can help you build upon your native language proficiency more easily. What does this mean? -- Reading and discussion materials appeal to your varied cultural experiences.<br>
<ul>
<li>Small group work on a daily basis
<li>Special language techniques designed for non-native speakers
<li>Special focus on grammar errors most frequently made by non-native speakers
<li>Instruction in vocabulary and culturally bound terms
<li>Preparation for American academics and exposure to information about American culture
</ul><p>

<a name="5"><b>CLASS COMPOSITION AND ATMOSPHERE</b></a><p>
ESL courses are made up of non-native speakers only. This gives you a greater chance to interact with students who share similar goals in adjusting to a new system academically, socially, and culturally. ESL students find they have a great deal in common with other students in their ESL classes. ESL students usually feel more "at home" in a shared atmosphere of language learning. It is usually easier for ESL students to voice their opinions or ask questions more freely in an environment where "having an accent" is not the exception but the rule!In ESL classes we study general language, literature, and culture. Most important, we learn to develop our thoughts in English.<br>
In ESL classes you learn how to study and learn in your other classes.ESL classes are designed to help non-native speakers, so they are more language intensive.Because most foreign students don't know certain things about this country, the ESL class gives them the chance to get important information about America.  ESL classes are a bridge to higher learning in the United States. Welcome to ESL!<p>
