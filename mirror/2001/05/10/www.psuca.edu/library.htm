The Pacific States University Library houses more than 14,800 volumes and regularly receives about 65 periodicals. Special effort is made to maintain the collection in the areas of business, computers, and electronics. The library is managed by a professional librarian and a part-time assistant librarian. It is open forty-eight (48) hours a week.<p>

PSU has undertaken an ambitious project to computerize its services. A recent addition has enabled PSU to subscribe to the UCLA Orion computer program, which makes an online search of the entire bibliography at that university available to PSU students. Through either the Inter-Library Loan Program or courtesy usage of the UCLA library facilities, PSU students can obtain requested materials.<p>

Several other local libraries have cooperative programs with no-charge, online searches that PSU students can access from the PSU library computers.  These include the library at California Institute of Technology, the Santa Monica Public Library, the Torrance Public Library, and the Palos Verdes Library District.  The Los Angeles Public Library soon will also have such a program.<p>

The PSU Library currently has the beginnings of an extensive CD ROM collection that will bolster the library's ability to support PSU's instructional program. At present, the CD ROM subscription service has a title database of more than 220,000 titles, many of which have direct application to the degrees and programs offered at PSU.<p>

The PSU Library also provides access to the Internet and other online information systems. These information superhighways have revolutionized study and research opportunities in higher education and have made a tremendous number of resources available to PSU students. The Los Angeles Public Library, home to the largest research collection west of the Mississippi River, provides each PSU student with a library card to its main library and forty-one (41) branches. These unparalleled resources open the larger world of education to PSU students without negating the many advantages of study in a small university.<p>

<b>Library charges:</b><p>

1.	Overdue books are charged US$1 per day beyond their due date; overdue reserved materials are charged US$2 per day. Charges are subject to annual revision and administrative waiver.<p>

<ol type=a>

When a lost book for which the borrower has been billed is returned before a replacement has been ordered, a refund not exceeding the replacement cost may be made. In case a replacement has been ordered, any refund to the borrower is at the discretion of the University Librarian.<p>
