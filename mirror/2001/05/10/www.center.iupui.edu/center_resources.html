<P>
While walk-ins are always welcome at The Center, we encourage you to make 
reservations so that the equipment (and consultants) you need can be available 
for you. 

<P>
RESERVATIONS are held for <B>up to 30 minutes</B> past your reserved time and 
are then made available as needed to others. Please extend the courtesy to other 
clients of calling when you know that you will not be able to keep a scheduled 
appointment.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="tape_checkout">VIDEO TAPES FOR CHECK-OUT</A></H1>

<P>
You may check-out <A HREF="video_check-outs.html">video tapes</A> of the I.U. 
School of Continuing Studies' Series on Learning Technologies broadcasts, 
satellite downlinks and commercial videos for which we have publisher permission 
to re-distribute, and occasional workshop and conference presentations.

<P>
Tapes may be checked out for a period of one week, with extensions possible 
if there are no others on the waiting list for that particular tape. For tapes 
with high demand, you may ask to be placed on a waiting list and notified when 
the tape you want becomes available for you. Broadcast tapes are generally 
available about one week after the broadcast date.

<P>

<P>
Some Center equipment is available for reservation on a first-come, first-served 
basis and may be checked out for use during on-going projects in development at 
The Center. In some circumstances, equipment may be made available to faculty 
for conference use off-campus.

<P>
Equipment may be checked out for a period of one week at a time, with extensions 
possible if there are no others on the waiting list for that particular item. 
Please note that some equipment is in high demand; the earlier you make your 
reservations, the more likely you are to receive your request.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="internal">RESOURCES IN THE CENTER</A></H1>

<P>
The Center maintains a variety of software and hardware on both PC and Mac 
workstations to assist faculty with instructional projects. All workstations 
have general software for word processing, presentation, web browsing, and 
network application, including Microsoft Office, Netscape, Internet Explorer, 
ftp, and telnet. In addition, the Center has clip art and utilities for 
zipping/unzipping files. 

<P>
Additional software available on selected machines is <A HREF="#software">listed 
below</A>. We have also described the <A HREF="#descriptions">types of 
projects</A> supported by Center resources. 

<P>
Requests for specialized software, inquiries about specific version numbers 
and available platform (Mac or PC), or inquiries about technical specifications 
of hardware configurations can be e-mailed to <A 
HREF="mailto:thecentr@iupui.edu">thecentr@iupui.edu</A>.

<H3><A NAME="descriptions">Descriptions</A></H3>

<P>
You can use Center workstations to create PowerPoint presentations or word 
processing documents, to transfer files, access Jewel e-mail accounts, and work 
with Oncourse. You might use PhotoShop or Illustrator to create or edit images, 
or create brochures or newsletters with PageMaker. If web page design is your 
interest, we have FrontPage and Dreamweaver. 

<P>
Other projects may require the use of special pieces of hardware. Listed are 
descriptions of these pieces and some of their uses. 

<P>
<A NAME="film_recorder"><B>Digital Film Recorder.</B></A> The film recorder is 
most often used to send PowerPoint presentations to slide film. This allows you 
to take the slide film for processing as 35-mm slides. You may purchase Kodak 
Elite Chrome film at the Center for use with the film recorder in either 24 or 
36 exposures.

<P>
<A NAME="slide_scanner"><B>Slide Scanner.</B></A> The slide scanner 
allows you to digitize 35-mm slides or negatives. This creates a digital image 
that you may include in a PowerPoint presentation, edit/enhance in PhotoShop, or 
use on a web page.

<P>
<A NAME="scanning"><B>Flatbed Scanning.</B></A> Flatbed scanners serve two 
purposes: text scanning (OCR) and image scanning. With OCR scanning, you can 
digitize text so that you can open the file in a word processing program for 
editing, printing, or saving. Image scanning creates a digital image that you 
may place in a PowerPoint presentation, edit/enhance in PhotoShop, or use on a 
web page. You can scan photographs, drawings, book covers, and even <A 
HREF="samples.html">small three-dimensional objects</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="cd_rom_maker"><B>CD-ROM Authoring.</B></A> CD-ROM Recorders (Burners) 
allow you to create a CD-ROM that can play in your multimedia computer or your 
favorite CD player (audio files only). CDs are easily portable and will hold a 
larger amount of information than will a floppy diskette.

<P>
<A NAME="editing"><B>Video Editing.</B></A> Video editing allows you to capture 
still or video clips from existing videos, or to create a video. You can also 
create duplicates of video tapes (for which you have copyright permission to do 
so). If you have a video created overseas, or wish to take a video to play 
overseas, you can convert to the necessary video format.

<P><B>Other Equipment</B>

<UL>
<LI>Zip and jaz drives that allow you to store more data/information than is 
possible on a floppy diskette
<LI>WACOM drawing tablet that allows you to draw using a stylus rather than the 
mouse
<LI>Audio cassette recorder
<LI>Laser disk player
<LI>High resolution document camera that allows you to photograph or digitize an 
object or document under a mounted, lighted camera
<LI>1200 dpi Laser Printer
