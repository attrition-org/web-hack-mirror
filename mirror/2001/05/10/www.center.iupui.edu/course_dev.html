ONCOURSE

<P CLASS=indent>
<A HREF="./oncourse/home.html">Oncourse</A> is a software system that provides a 
comprehensive solution for the creation of sophisticated World Wide Web-based 
teaching and learning environments. For distance education courses or 
face-to-face instruction, Oncourse offers an easy-to-use way for faculty to 
develop distributed multimedia course content and use collaborative tools to 
support teaching and learning. With a rich array of features, Oncourse offers an 
automatic method to create a web site for every course offered at the 
university. Once a course offering is entered into the registrar's database, the 
teaching faculty and students registered for the course will be able to 
automatically access the course web site from anywhere via the Internet by 
entering their University Network ID.

<P CLASS=indent>
<A HREF="webct.html">WebCT</A> is a tool that facilitates the creation of 
sophisticated World Wide Web-based educational environments by non-technical 
users. It can be used to create entire on-line courses, or to simply publish 
materials that supplement existing courses. WebCT not only produces courses for 
the WWW, but also uses WWW browsers as the interface for the course-building 
environment. Aside from facilitating the organization of course material on the 
web, WebCT also provides a wide variety of tools and features that can be added 
to a course.
