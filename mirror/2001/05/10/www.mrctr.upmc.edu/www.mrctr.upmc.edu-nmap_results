Warning:  OS detection will be MUCH less reliable because we did not find at least 1 open and 1 closed TCP port
Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (2), OS detection may be less accurate

Interesting ports on www.mrctr.upmc.edu (128.147.59.94):

Aggressive OS guesses: IRIX 6.4 - 6.5.3m (91%), IRIX 6.2 - 6.5 (91%)
No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see http://www.insecure.org/cgi-bin/nmap-submit.cgi).
