USS SACRAMENTO (AOE-1) 
</CENTER>&nbsp;<br>

The name SACRAMENTO has been worn by warships of the 
United States since 1863, when the first USS SACRAMENTO, 
a steam-propelled, wooden, sloop-of-war, was commissioned.
The second ship, a Gun Boat, USS SACRAMENTO (PG-19), 
commissioned in 1914, sailed in many foreign waters and 
visited so many foreign ports it is unlikely her record 
will be equaled again. Her long and distinguished record 
included patrols and port calls in Central America, the 
Caribbean, New England Coast, Gibraltar, Barbery Coast, 
Italy, British Isles, Northern Russia, Norway, France, 
Suez Canal, Bombay, Colombia, Singapore, Philippine 
Islands, China, Japan, Siberia, California Cost, seven 
years of operations from Shanghai with the Asiatic Fleet, 
and training of Naval Reservist on the Great Lakes.
USS SACRAMENTO (AOE-1) is the third ship of the fleet to 
bear the name. She is a fast combat support ship, 
performing the functions of three logistics support 
ships: fleet oiler (AO), Ammunition ship (AE), and 
refrigerated-stores ship (AF). Although SACRAMENTO has 
two 50,000 horsepower steam engines to drive her 792-foot 
long length at more than 30 knots, and all the modern 
equipment to do the job, it is the 650 men and women 
who crew her that make SUPER SAC go.  These highly 
trained, capable professionals maintain, repair, 
operate and manage all shipboard systems and people.  
They are required to perform their assigned duties 
day or night under all weather and combat conditions, 
around the clock if necessary, in order to fuel, feed, 
supply, re-arm, and deliver the mail to the fleet. 
SACRAMENTO proudly serves under the motto:
