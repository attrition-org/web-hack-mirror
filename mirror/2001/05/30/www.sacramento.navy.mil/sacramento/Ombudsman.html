The Navy Family OMBUDSMAN play a vital role in support of the Navy's mission.  They assure the well-being of our servicemembers' spouses and families.  The OMBUDSMAN was established during a period of war and significant social change in our country; it was a response by the U.S. Navy to changing times and demands. Since then, the Navy Family OMBUDSMAN has grown to be an integral part of navy life. Sacramento's OMBUDSMAN are outstanding individuals who selflessly volunteer their time and talents on behalf of our crew members and their families.
