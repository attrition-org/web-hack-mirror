      Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (NCESGR) is a Department of Defense
      organization that works with employers, reservists, military leadership,
      and 54 volunteer committees to build and maintain a strong base of support
      for the role of the National Guard and Reserve in our Nations defense.</font>
      <p><font face="Caslon Bd BT">How reserve commanders and members can help improve employer support</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Caslon Bd BT">Keep employers and supervisors posted on drill dates. Be fair with
          employers; let them know as far in advance as possible when training
          is scheduled. Don't spring it at the last minute. Provide them plenty
          of time to schedule a replacement if necessary.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Caslon Bd BT">Tell the employer about the productive things being learned and
          accomplished while their employees are in uniform. An employee
          returning from drill or training should talk about the real
          accomplishments of the unit. Don't give the employer the impression
          that it was a vacation away from work. That could hamper future
          participation.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Caslon Bd BT">At least once a year thank the employer and the supervisor for their
          cooperation. Let them know their support in arranging schedules to fit
          military duty is appreciated by both the employee and the unit
          commander. Invite them to be members of the Guard and Reserve for a
          day for a walk-through or take them on a field exercise. As a minimum,
          write them a warm, appreciative letter. Whatever method is chosen,
          recognize every employer personally and express gratitude for their
          support.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Caslon Bd BT">Use training on the job. The armed forces operate some of the best
          technical schools in the world and many Reservists are graduates. If
          possible, this training should be used on the civilian job and all
          opportunities should be taken to improve skills through advanced
          courses. Leadership and management experience received in uniform are
          valuable, too; they can lead to a better job and higher pay in
          civilian occupations.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Caslon Bd BT">Iron our problems personally. If employer problems develop, try to
          resolve them by personal contact or with the assistance of your chain
          of command. Cordial relations with employers usually will reap
          cooperation. If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached, there are
          ombudsman services available at both the state and national levels.
