What is an Ombudsman?</STRONG>
</FONT>
<P>
The Navy Ombudsman has a long and rich tradition and has become an integral part of Navy Operations.  Sailors today are tasked to deploy more frequently and for longer periods.  Knowing their loved ones are safe and help is available is crucial to success.
<P>
The Ombudsman Program is a critical element in helping the individual Command fulfill its responsibilities for the welfare of its families.  In the unusual position of being an officially appointed volunteer, the ombudsman provides the Commanding Officer with a communication Link to family members.
<P>
An ombudsman is the spouse or other family member of a crewmember who has volunteered their time and effort to help guide other families through problems.  The ombudsman will not solve the problem, but will try to point them in the right direction. 

<P> The roles and functions of the command family ombudsman are varied:
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Serve as the primary Link/Liaison between families and the command. 
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Serve as a communicator for information between the command and command families.
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Communicate regularly with the families.  This includes a Ombudsman Newsletter and a message service.
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Provide information and outreach to command family members.  
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Interact and cooperate with organizations and military offices such as Family Service Centers, chaplain's office, medical treatment facilities, Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, American Red Cross, and legal assistance offices.  These organizations are valuable resources for obtaining assistance for command family members.
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Refer individuals in need of professional assistance to the appropriate resource.  Ombudsman may provide support to individuals and refer them for counseling.  Ombudsman can not provide counseling themselves.
<P><IMG src="images/bullet.gif" alt="" height=18 width=30 align=left>Act as an advocate for the command family members.  Ombudsmand, by using their knowledge of the system, can help access the appropriate level of the chain of command for intervention and for the forwarding of appropriate requests/grievances while exercising confidentiality.
