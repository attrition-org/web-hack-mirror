<P align=left>USS KINKAID (DD 965) is the third of thirty-one SPRUANCE class Destroyers and the second to join the Pacific Fleet.  KINKAID is homeported in San Diego, California and is assigned to Destroyer Squadron SEVEN.
<P>Designed and built by Ingalls Shipyard of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi, KINKAID is a member of the first major class of surface ships in the United States Navy to be powered by gas turbine engines.  Four General Electric LM-2500 engines, marine versions of those used on DC-10 and C5A aircraft, drive the ship in excess of 30 knots.  Twin controlled reversible pitch propellers provide KINKAID with a degree of maneuverability unique among warships of her size.
<P>A highly versatile multi-mission destroyer, KINKAID is capable of operating independently or in company with Carrier or Amphibious Task Forces.  The ship displaces 9150 tons and is 563 feet in length.  KINKAID's primary mission is to operate offensively in an undersea warfare role.  It's primary passive USW sensor is the AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array Sonar (TACTASS).  KINKAID's active sonar, the most advanced underwater detection and fire control system yet developed, is fully integrated with a digital Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS), providing the ship with faster and more accurate processing of target information.   Integration of the ship's digital gun fire control system into the NTDS provides quick reaction in the mission areas of shore bombardment, surface warfare and air warfare.
<P>The ship's weapon systems include the MK41 Vertical Launch System (capable of firing the Tomahawk cruise mission and Vertically Launched Anti-Submarine Rocket), twin MK32 three-barrel torpedo tubes, the HARPOON surface-to-surface cruise missile system, two MK45 5"/54 caliber gun mounts, the MK57 NATO Seasparrow self-defense missile system, Super RBOC chaff tubes, two MK15 20MM Close-in Weapons System PHALANX guns, facilities for operating the LAMPS III helicopter, and the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system.
<P>Crew comfort and habitability are an integral part of KINKAID's design.  Berthing compartments are spacious and the ship is equipped with amenities not normally found aboard other destroyers, including a Training Room, Education Room, and Gymnasium.  Although KINKAID is as large as a World War II cruiser, a high degree of automation permits a reduced crew of 24 officers and 335 enlisted to operate the ship.
<P>KINKAID is one of the world's more modern destroyers with an advanced propulsion system and fully integrated combat systems.  Her growth potential ensures she will remain a potent force for freedom for years to come.

<P>The official crest of KINKAID is highly symbolic of the ship's namesake Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, one of America's great Naval Officers.
<P>The blue globe with a seven-pointed star within represents the seven oceans of the world in which the ship is prepared to serve, and also alludes to Admiral Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet Command. The five rays of the sunburst denote the five major battles in which Admiral Kinkaid participated in the Pacific: Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, the Aleutians, and Leyte Gulf.
<P>The four stars in the blue field and the three points in gold refer to the numerical designation of the Seventh Fleet, which Admiral Kinkaid commanded in support of General MacArthur's major operations in four areas: Hollandia, the Philippines; the Admiralties and Borneo. The stars also refer to Admiral Kinkaid's promotion to full Admiral.
<P>The scarlet in the base of the shield alludes to Admiral Kinkaid's role as Commander of the North Pacific Fleet in the Aleutians where he directed the operations that ended the only enemy occupation of American soil. The color red is also symbolic of courage and the heat and action of battle.
<P>The Ship's Motto &quot;Steadfast and True&quot; comes from two letters from and about Admiral Kinkaid. &quot;Steadfast&quot; was the word used by Fleet Admiral Ernest King to describe Admiral Kinkaid in a letter written
to Mrs. Kinkaid in 1942. &quot;True&quot; is from a letter Admiral Kinkaid wrote to his wife in 1945, in which he said that above all else, he wanted to be remembered for having been true to his mission.
