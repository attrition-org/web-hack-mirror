              QUESTIONS/CONCERNS RECEIVED TO DATE (02/27/01)</font></b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">The following 
              are samples of questions raised by employees in the PACNORWEST area 
              who are also going through an FA. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Q</b> 
              Will the current manning levels remain the same after the FA is 
              complete or will people lose their jobs? <br>
              A The final result of the FA will be the identification of a Most 
              Efficient Organization (MEO) for providing the services under study, 
              i.e., Military Family Housing, Food Service etc. The MEO will determine 
              the positions that will remain and will likely include a combination 
              of the following: retention of existing positions, abolishment of 
              some positions, and the development of some new positions. Employees 
              will be either placed in a MEO position or will be subject to RIF/BBA 
              procedures.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Q</b> Will each function be required to be reduced or is Support 
              Services as a whole being reduced by 30%?<br>
              <b>A</b> There is no fixed reduction that we have to meet. It is 
              generally believed we will be able to find approximately 30% savings 
              based on similar studies within the Department of Defense but we 
              are not being held to that amount. It is important to note that 
              savings are not just based upon elimination or realignment of positions 
              but will include other cost savings as well. Most likely each function 
              will be required to reduce in some ways however the MEO will determine 
              how the reductions are spread.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Q</b> Isn't 
              it true that the Command has already made up their minds on what 
              changes are going to be made?<br>
              <b>A</b> No. The Command is in the process of finalizing the paperwork 
              that will document that we have received formal permission to conduct 
              a two year Functionality Assessment instead of an A-76 Competitive 
              Analysis Bid Process to determine how to reduce cost and maintain 
              or improve services to our customers. It is true there are real 
              reductions in the budget that must be dealt with. However, it is 
              through the FA process that we will be discovering the best way, 
              within the Navy guidelines, to internally change our processes and 
              control our destiny.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Q</b> Will 
              we have a chance to participate in the development of the "To Be" 
              organization?<br>
              <b>A</b> Yes, many teams have already been formed to begin the collection 
              of data and information for the "As Is" write-up and more teams, 
              including cross-functional ones, will be formed to assist with the 
              "To Be" development. Although not every staff member may be on a 
              formal team, everyone's ideas about how to improve customer service 
              and reduce costs are needed throughout this process. You can forward 
              your ideas to your Site Representative or function Team Lead. If 
              you choose, you can also forward them to Dr. Mary Rotterman. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Q</b> Do 
              you expect any RIF's/BBA's? If so, will HR help me find a new job?<br>
              <b>A</b> In all likelihood there will be a need to downsize the 
              workforce. The necessity of RIF (for APF employees) or BBA (for 
              NAFI employees) will depend upon a variety of factors, e.g., attrition, 
              retirements, placement actions, authorization for voluntary Separation 
              Incentive Pay/Voluntary Early Retirement (VSIP/VERA), etc. In the 
              event of involuntary separations, outplacement services will be 
              made available. For APF employees, this could include placement 
              on the DOD Priority Placement Program (PPP) stopper list for consideration 
              for other jobs in DOD and for NAFI employees it could include placement 
              on the Retention Placement List (RPL). The region will take all 
              steps available to minimize involuntary separations. </font></p>
	     
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Q</b> It seems to me the dust has not settled from all the changes and reductions that came with regionalization.  I have two questions:
<ol>
  <li>Why are we doing the Functionality Assessment now and how is it different from 
regionalization? 
  <li>b. Will we be using data already collected under regionalization or will we have to do everything over again? 
</ol>

<b>A</b> First of all, confusion and frustration are shared by everyone.  Just the fact we keep facing more changes is bad enough not to mention that the types of changes continue to place our jobs under scrutiny with all the uncertainty that brings.  Could we have done better with regionalization?  Yes, but it would have meant more changes than have already occurred. 

<ol>
  <li>The FA can be viewed as Phase 2 of our reengineering efforts.  The bogey is still out 
there and we still need to find savings. Regionalization made some broadstroke changes but did not include the kind of comprehensive detailed analysis of how each Support Services program operates (both direct services and indirect services).  This is our task now. 

  <li>Every effort will be made to use existing data wherever it is available.  If the data is very critical and there are any questions about it's completeness, currency, or accuracy, however, it will be in our best interests to dig deeper, e.g., workload data.
</ol>
</font></p>

<p>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Q</b>  Everyone is talking about getting more efficient and making our processes more employee and customer friendly. But no one is guarenteeing that we won't be headed for a Commercial Activity (CA) Study after the FA is done.   Isn't there a danger in coming up with the "bottom line" Most Efficient Organization for the FA when we might have to go on to a CA?

<br><b>A</b>  Since the most recent round of CA Studies, the Navy has become more open to how savings are found.  A formal FA is one of these ways and the positions under Support Services are now formally coded as going through a FA vs. CA.  For this reason, we need to approach the FA with the same level of commitment as we would a CA, i.e., we need to come up with the Most Efficient Organization and hopefully reach the approximate savings that come with CA's:  30%.  If we do both these, we will be in the best position possible to argue against a CA.  Although there are no guarantees, the best strategy to avoid a future CA is to come together as a Team under this FA.</font></p>
