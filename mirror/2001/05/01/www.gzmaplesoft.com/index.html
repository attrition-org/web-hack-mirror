<Center>ASIAN DOMINATION! <center>Uh-oh mr. big bad china looks like hackweiser just made
you look like a fool in front of all of your internet buddies! <center>Imagine tomorrow
around the water cooler when all your work cohorts are chatting it up about how well they
are doing their job and then you get called into the bosses office. <center> Uh oh the
boss sounds a bit angry :(. <Center>You walk into your bosses office thinking "What could
have possibly gone wrong?" the he pulls up the company's webpage and says "Missuh wing
dang who are deese hackwhysar peopul en why are they on my webprage?!" <center>Then you
see the webpage and realize "oohhh rooo i have breen hracked!" <center>Then you wet your
pants and scramble for an idea on how to fix it and you realize that you were a good
admin and kept logs...not so quick sonny jim! <center>You pull up /var/log and realize
it's not there! <center>All you can do now is cry and realize that yes, like many others,
Hackweiser has owned you! <center>And one final message admin...you weren't hacked
because we don't like you, if we met you on the street we might even get drunk with you,
but i seriously doubt it. You were hacked for the cyber war of the united states vs.
china. You may now commence crying again. <Center><b>The final solution is approaching,
be warned. <center>For all you gay chinese psuedo hacker fucks, why don't you check out
your beloved pilot Buffalo Wing Ding was doing and why he got hit:
<Center>http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/13/air.collision.01 <center>Your
pilot deserved to die and he can burn in hell forever. <center>it's his own fault now giv
ethe fucking plane back!
