<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>

<h4>The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with others to conserve,
protect and enhance fish and wildlife and their habitat for the continuing benefit of the
American people. </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center">Why &quot;Mountain-Prairie&quot;?</h2>

<p>This U.S. Fish and Wildlife Region's nickname aptly describes the two most prominent
physical features of the eight-state area. The eastern portion is comprised of the Great
Plains, primarily the short-grass prairies. To the west rise the Rocky Mountains, and
parts of the inter-mountain west beyond the Continental Divide. </p>

<p>The climate over much of the region is semi-arid to arid. Hence existing surface waters
are all the more vital to wildlife. In the northeastern portion of the Region, in eastern
Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, is a physiographic area known as the Prairie
Coteau, a land marked by small ponds and wetlands. Left by the last glacier, these
&quot;prairie potholes&quot; are among the most important nesting habitat for waterfowl in
North America.</p>

<p>The Regional Office, in Denver, administers federal fish and wildlife conservation
activities in the eight states, through three &quot;eco-regions&quot; -- North and South
Dakota; Montana and Wyoming; and Utah, Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas.</p>
