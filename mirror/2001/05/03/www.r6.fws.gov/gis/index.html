</font></u></b><font COLOR="#000000">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Within the Mountain Prairie Region - Region 6 of the U.S. Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service, an overwhelming interest in the utility of GIS for resource management
exists. Many programs are utilizing the technology in order to manage the System&#146;s
resources more efficiently and effectively. Currently, approximately 20 offices within the
Region are either developing or implementing GIS in their management activities. During
the next few years, the interest in GIS is expected to increase regionally. The increase
in interest is due to differing factors, among which are the development and
implementation of Comprehensive Conservation Plans. In addition to planning, GIS is used
throughout the Region for cultural and natural resource management, scientific modeling,
interpretation, and other management functions.</p>
