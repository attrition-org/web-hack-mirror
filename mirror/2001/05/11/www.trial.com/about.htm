      <font size="2" face="Arial">     The Network of Trial Law Firms, Inc. is a not-for-profit
      association.  The goal of the 25 law firms participating in the Network is to provide their clients with high quality trial and litigation
      representation through advances in education, technology, business and science.  The Network is
      engaged in a number of activities to assist law firms to accomplish that goal including research and study
      of advances in the state-of-the-art of legal representation, and sponsorship of CLE
      seminars for continuing legal education of corporate and outside counsel and insurance professionals.  Our CLE
      programs aid in the dissemination of new information and effective techniques and technologies to
      attorneys and claims professionals serving corporations and insurers.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1993 we have conducted two three-day CLE seminars each year. In
      2000, we added one-day CLE seminars to our offerings.  Our focus is
      always excellence in litigation management and trial results.  We are the home of the "Litigation Management Supercourse," a program that
      our attorneys created 12 years ago and have produced and updated more than 20 times
      since then together with various not-for-profit CLE organizations and bar associations.</font>
