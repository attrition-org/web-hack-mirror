    presents a fresh, approach to the delivery of corporate legal services. Formed in August
    1996 as the largest new law firm in the history of Minnesota, we have dedicated ourselves
    to a uniquely cost-effective and innovative strategy for providing legal services to
    corporate counsel. With our state-of-the-art computer and telecommunication systems, we
    represent local, national and international businesses, including manufacturers,
    distributors, nationwide managed care entities, educational institutions and
    municipalities. <br>
    <br>
    Our litigation style is team-based and client-centered. To create cost-effective value for
    our clients we staff our cases efficiently, but have the resources and experience to
    pursue the most complex litigation when necessary. Most importantly however, our values
    reflect our clients' values and our practice mirrors the re-engineering that has
    transformed our clients' world.</font> </small><p><small><font face="Arial">Our legal technology for servicing
    clients is unsurpassed. We offer our clients the most advanced computer, document
    management and telecommunications systems available to the legal profession. We are
    prepared for the voluminous documentation of complex litigation with document imaging and
    retrieval systems, real-time testimony transcription programs and computerized litigation
    support materials. Our universal access to online research databases, legal library
    reference materials and the Internet allows every one of our employees to serve clients
    with the most up-to-date information. The cost of these services, including the costs of
    computerized legal research, are never passed on to our clients.</font> </small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The people of Halleland Lewis Nilan Sipkins &amp; Johnson have embraced the
    following Core Values as the fundamental shared motivations of the institution we have
    created:</font> </small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial"><strong>TRUST</strong>: We value honesty and communication, and have the
    confidence in each other's motivations to candidly yet respectfully resolve our
    differences.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>EXCELLENCE</strong>: We seek constant improvement in the quality of our work and
    our service to clients, and are committed to investing in even closer partnerships with
    our clients and greater sophistication in our delivery of top legal services. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>DIVERSITY</strong>: We recognize that all talented people can lend value to our
    organization, and are committed to affording opportunities not only for women and
    minorities but for those with different backgrounds or lifestyles to share their talents
    productively.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INNOVATION</strong>: We are dedicated to anticipating our clients' changing needs
    and we are willing to take the risks necessary to meet and surpass those needs. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PROFITABILITY</strong>: We seek to earn a fair profit as a return on the
    investment of our skills, experience, time, and resources, and to share our financial
    success with all those who make it possible.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">
    <strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: We will treat each other with respect, and provide an
    environment where people share a sense of excitement and enjoyment and can flourish in
    both their personal and professional lives.</font></small></p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="254">
    <p><small><font face="Arial">
    <strong>TRUST</strong> is the cornerstone of our organization. It is our confidence in
    each other and in our shared motivations that allows us to practice together better than
    we could alone. It is trust that makes a team-oriented practice productive and effective,
    enables us to honestly air our differences, confide our individual goals, take risks,
    weather the occasional failure, and support each others' varied efforts. We are committed
    to this effort. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>EXCELLENCE</strong> is what we offer to our clients. All people in our
    organization are committed to providing the highest caliber of legal work product in a way
    that meets and surpasses our clients' highest needs. This commitment to excellence
    requires us to understand our clients' businesses and treat them as our partners, to
    recruit, train and mentor the best attorneys and staff, to utilize the most effective
    technology, and to enforce our own standards of quality and service. We will meet these
    requirements. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>DIVERSITY</strong> is not only a commitment to aggressively seek and retain highly
    qualified women and minorities. It is more broadly a commitment to afford opportunities to
    all people who have talents beneficial to our clients, and to aggressively shape and
    re-think our organization in ways that accommodate all talented people for the ultimate
    betterment of our clients. We have made this commitment. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INNOVATION</strong> is a necessity for effective service of sophisticated clients
    in a changing legal marketplace. Consistent innovation requires an attitude: a lasting
    commitment to open-mindedness and a willingness to occasionally fail, a dedication to
    eradicate complacency based on our successes, and a readiness to challenge any convention
    of private law practice that affects the quality of our work product or our service to
    clients. At the same time, we recognize that &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different&quot; are
    only meaningful to our clients if they are also &quot;better.&quot; We embrace the
    challenge of being new, different, and better.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PROFITABILITY</strong> is essential to our survival as an organization. It also
    affords us the luxury of financially recognizing individuals' hard work and varied
    contributions to the shared success of our firm and the fulfillment of our clients' needs.
    Profitability in this sense means not just revenue generation, but efficient management of
    our costs and personnel, creativity in designing mutually beneficial arrangements with our
    clients, and a selective approach to new business opportunities.&nbsp; We recognize,
    however, that our commitments to other institutional values may require some compromise to
    profit, and we are comfortable with that balance. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>COMMUNITY</strong> is an acknowledgment that belonging to an organization like
    ours requires both commitment to, and sacrifice from, its members. All members of our firm
    deserve to be treated fairly, to be heard, to have a comfortable and efficient place to
    work, and to have fun in the process. We believe that we do our best work in this
    environment.</font></small></p>
