    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="253"><font face="Arial"><small>Deutsch, Kerrigan &amp; Stiles views the task of
    resolving a legal problem as a partnership between the client and its outside counsel. Our
    goal is to work closely with each client to provide high quality, effective legal service
    which exceeds the client's expectations. <br>
    <br>
    Our clients have the confidence in us to represent them beyond Louisiana for the same
    reasons they trust us with their problems in Louisiana: we get results, and we get them
    efficiently. To do this, we begin by knowing our clients. We learn our clients' business,
    their business philosophy, their goals and how they achieve them. When faced with a
    particular problem, we combine this knowledge with our knowledge of the law and our
    familiarity with the agency, court or other tribunal that will apply that law to craft a
    solution that will best meet the client's goals. <br>
    <br>
    With over 60 attorneys and a substantial support staff of paralegals and legal assistants,
    we apply our legal and support resources carefully to most effectively meet the needs of
    our clients. Every file is assigned to an experienced attorney who coordinates all work on
    the case and maintains ongoing communication with the client. With the client's
    permission, that attorney may handle the case alone or draw on the talents and skills of
    other attorneys in the firm. <br>
    <br>
    Because regular communication with our clients is essential, in addition to meetings and
    telephone conversations, we use the latest technology to communicate. Each of our
    attorneys has access through a state-of-the-art network to e-mail, the Internet, database,
    word processing and calendaring programs. Our dial-up networking and Internet capabilities
    also allow us to share the information on our network with our clients. We are also
    developing an Extranet to expand this ability and provide for the management of complex
    litigation. Through our membership in The Network of Trial Law Firms, a separate
    non-profit organization that includes 2,700 attorneys nationwide practicing in
      75 local
    offices in 24 separate and independent trial law firms, we use an Intranet to share
    information with other attorneys throughout the country. Our use of&nbsp; technology also
    extends to our communication with judges and juries. Our trial presentation capabilities
    were featured in a major California criminal trial, in which a DK&amp;S paralegal operated
    the same system that we use in our own cases.</small></font> </td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="254"><small><font face="Arial">
    The firm utilizes creative alternatives to traditional litigation procedures. We have
    successfully engaged ad hoc judges, arbitrators and mediators in resolution of such
    matters. We have convinced the courts to use mini-trials or selected issue resolution to
    bring practicality to complicated cases. <br>
    <br>
    Our clients include local, national and international businesses, as well as state and
    local governmental bodies and non-profit organizations. They range in size from Fortune
    500 companies to small, emerging businesses and individuals and include, among others,
    manufacturers, insurance companies, contractors, real estate developers, financial
    institutions, airline companies, architects and engineers, oil and gas exploration and
    dredging companies, and marine service businesses. <br>
    <br>
    We provide our clients with a wide variety of legal services in most major practice areas,
    including, aviation, bankruptcy, commercial, commercial litigation, construction, energy,
    environmental, estate planning, fidelity &amp; surety, franchising &amp; distribution,
    intellectual property and technology, labor &amp; employment, litigation, oil &amp; gas,
    products liability, real estate, tax and toxic torts.<br>
    <br>
    Deutsch, Kerrigan &amp; Stiles consists mostly of trial lawyers, who practice throughout
    Louisiana and Southern Mississippi. In addition, some of our lawyers are licensed to
    practice in Florida, Texas, Maryland, Kansas, Illinois, New York and the District of
    Columbia. Our membership in The Network of Trial Law Firms also allows us to use resources
    throughout the country to represent our clients' interests.</font> </small><p><small><font face="Arial">Click
