I write messages on money. Its my own form of social protest. A letter printed on paper that no one will destroy, passed indiscriminately across race, class and gender lines.. and written in the blood that keeps the beast alive. A quiet little hijacking on the way to the check-out counter. And a federal crime. I hope that someone will find my message one day when they really need it.  Like I do. puhrahfit@hushmail.com - pr0phet
