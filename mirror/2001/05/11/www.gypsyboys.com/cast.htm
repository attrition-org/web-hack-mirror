     SIZE="-2">Alberto was born in 1980 in California, and has been
    acting since the age of 14. He has accumulated credits in over
    30 productions (film, television, and theatrical); the majority
    of his work has been in independent films. For 3 years he was
    a broadcast journalist on the San Francisco-based newsmagazine
    &quot;First Cut&quot; for KRON-TV 4. In the past year, he starred
    in a film set in Mexico, appeared in a video for VISA, was seen
    throughout the Bay Area in a Spanish language commercial, and
    returned to the stage after a three year absence to appear in
    &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;Twelve Angry Men.&quot;
    He has recently decided to put his acting career on hold in order
    to pursue his main passion: writing. Keep an eye out for novels
    by Alberto coming to your local bookstore in the near future.

    out his next project, Tom also works with a local producer bringing
    Broadway touring shows into San Francisco. Incidentally, he has
    been friends with the director, Brian Shepp since he moved to
    San Francisco, and the character he plays was written with him

    where he appeared in television, commercials, theater, and tours
    throughout Italy and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. When he moved
    back to New York, he continued working in the theater and doing
    the occasional spot on &#147;One Life To Live&#148; and various
    feature films. He moved to San Francisco in 1996 and quickly

    Boys&#148; is Greg&#146;s first feature film although many recognize
    Greg for his vast array of magazine and print work. His pictures
    have been feature in multiple issues of OUT, Genre, XY Magazine,
    Australian Blue Magazine, and San Francisco and from the covers
    of circuit music CD&#146;s to Christmas Cards from Soho Galleries.
    Greg&#146;s work has always been a bit &#147;off-the-wall&#148;
    fulfilling the goofy silly roles others avoid. He&#146;s been
    a leather guy for Absolute S&amp;M, naked and covered in Latex,
    and hit ten foot jumps for XY on Burton Snowboards knowing that
    he&#146;d spit his teeth out when hitting the ground. When challenged
    with finding someone for the fantasy role of Scott, Greg was
    a sure fit for fulfilling the role of Vampire, Sword Fighter,
    and the hero on horseback, not to mention his type-cast role
    as a cheesy model. Since a kid, Greg&#146;s favorite game was
    always Truth or Dare... but he never could tell the truth. He
    looks forward to his next Dare - be it Film or Print.</FONT></TD>
