<b><big>Estimates</big</b>
<P>1. War is a matter of vital importance to the State; the province of
life or death; the road ro survival or ruin. It is mandatory that it be
thoroughly studied.</P>

<P>2. Therefore, appraise it inn terms of the five fundamental factors
and make comparisons of the seven elements later named. So you may access
its essentials.</P>

<P>3. The first of these factors is moral influence; the second, weather;
the third, terrain; the fourth, command; and the fifth, doctrine.</P>

<P>4. By moral influence, I mean that which causes the people to be in
harmony with their leaders, so that they will accompany them in life and
unto death without fear of mortal peril.</P>

<P>5. By weather I mean the interaction of natural forces; the effects
of winter's cold and summer's heat and the conduct of military operations
in accordance with the seasons.</P>

<P>6. By terrain I mean distances, whether the ground is traversed with
ease or difficulty, whether it is open or constricted, and the chances
of life or death.</P>

<P>7. By command I mean the general's qualities of wisdom, sincerity, humanity,
courage, and strictness.</P>

<P>8. By doctrine I mean organization, control, assignment of appropriate
ranks to officers, regulation of supply routes, and the provision of principle
items used by the army.</P>

<P>9. There is no general who has not heard of these five matters. Those
who master them win; those who do not are defeated.</P>

<P>10. Therefor in laying plans compare the following elements, appraising
them with the utmost care.</P>

<P>11. If you say which ruler possesses moral influence, which commander
is the more abe, which army obtains the advantages of nature and the terrain,
in which regulations and instructions are better carried out, which troops
are the stronger;</P>

<P>12. Which has the better trained officers and men;</P>

<P>13. And which administers rewards and punishments in a more enlightened
manner;</P>

<P>14. I will be able to forecast which side will be victorious and which
defeated.</P>

<P>15. If a general who heeds my strategy is employed he is certain to
win. retain him! When one who refuses to listen to my strategy is employed,
he is certain to be defeated. Dismiss him!</P>

<P>16. Having paid heed to the advantages of my plans, te general must
create situations which will contribute to their accomplishment. By 'situations'
I mean that he should act expediently in accordance with what is advantageous
and so control the balance.</P>

<P>17. All warfare is based on deception.</P>

<P>18. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity.</P>

<P>19. When near, make it appear that you are far away; when far away,
that you are near.</P>

<P>20. Offer the enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him.</P>

<P>21. When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid
him.</P>

<P>22. Anger his general and confuse him.</P>

<P>23. Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.</P>

<P>24. Keep him under a strain and wear him down.</P>

<P>25. When he is united, divide him.</P>

<P>26. Attack where he is unprepared; sally out when he does not expect
you.</P>

<P>27. These are the strategist'skey to victory. It is not possible to
discuss them beforehand.</P>

<P>28. Now if the estimates made in the temple before hostilities indicate
a victory it is because calculations show one's strength to be superior
to that of his enemy; if they indicate defeat, it is because calculations
show that one is inferior. With many calculations, one can win; with few
one cannot. How much less chance of victory has one who makes none at all!
By this means I examine the situation and the outcome will be clearly apparent.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Waging War"></A>Waging War [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art
Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Generally, operations of war require one thousand fast four-horse
chariots, one thousand four-horse wagons covered in leather, and one thousand
mailed troops.</P>

<P>2. When provisions are transported for a thousand li expenditures at
home and in the field, stipends for the entertainment of advisors and visitors,
the cost of materials such as glue and lacquer, and of chariots and armour,
will amount to one thousand pieces of gold a day. After this money is in
hand, one hundred thousand troops may be raised.</P>

<P>3. Victory is the main object in war. If this is long delayed, weapons
are blunted and morale depressed. When troops attack cities, their strength
will be exhausted.</P>

<P>4. When the army engages in protracted campaigns the resources of the
state will not suffice.</P>

<P>5. When your weapons are dulled and ardour damped, your strength exhausted
and treasure spent, neighboouring rulers will take advantage of your distress
to act. And even though you have wise counsellors, nonoe will be able to
lay good plans for the future.</P>

<P>6. Thus, while we have heard of blundering swiftness in war, we have
not yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged.</P>

<P>7. For there has never been a protracted war from which a country has
benefited.</P>

<P>8. Thus those unable to understand the dangers inherent in employing
troops are equally unable to understand the advantageous ways of doing
so.</P>

<P>9. Those adept in waging war do not require a second levy of conscripts
nor more than one provisioning.</P>

<P>10. They carry equipment from the homeland; they rely for provisions
on the enemy. Thus the army is plentifully provided with food.</P>

<P>11. When a country is impoverished by military operations it is due
to distant transportation; carriage of supplies for great distances renders
the people destitute.</P>

<P>12. Where the army is, the prices are high; when prices rise the wealth
of the people is exhausted. When wealth is exhausted the peasantry will
be affilcted with urgent exactions.</P>

<P>13. With strength thus depleted and wealth consumed the households in
the central plains will be utterly impoverished and seven-tenths of their
wealth dissapated.</P>

<P>14. As to government expenditures, those due to broken-down chariots,
worn-out horses, armour and helmets, arrows and crossbows, lances, hand
and body shields, draft animals and supply wagons will amount to sixty
per cent of the total.</P>

<P>15. Hence the wise general sees to it that his troops feed on the enemy,
for one bushel of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of his;
one hundredweight of enemy fodder to twenty hundredweight of his.</P>

<P>16. The reason troops slay the enemy is because they are enraged.</P>

<P>17. They take booty from the enemy because they desire wealth.</P>

<P>18. Therefore, when in chariot fighting more than ten chariots are captured,
reward those who take the first. replace the enemy's flags and banners
with your own, mix the captured chariots with yours, and mount them.</P>

<P>19. Treat the captives well, and care for them.</P>

<P>20. This is called 'winning a battle and becoming stronger'.</P>

<P>21. Hence what is essential in war is victory, not prolonged operations.
And therefore the general who understands war is the Minister of the people's
fate and arbiter of the nation's destiny.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Offensive Strategy"></A>Offensive Strategy [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art
Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Generally in war the best policy is to take a state intact; to ruin
it is inferior to this.</P>

<P>2. To capture the enemy's army is better than to destroy it; to take
intact a battalion, a company or a five-man squad is better than to destroy
them.</P>

<P>3. For to winn one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the
acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.</P>

<P>4. Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's
strategy;</P>

<P>5. Next best is to disrupt his alliances:</P>

<P>6. The next best is to attack his army.</P>

<P>7. The worst policy is to attack cities. Attack cities only when there
is no alternative.</P>

<P>8. To prepare the shielded wagons and make ready the necessary arms
and equipment requires at least three months; to pile up earthen ramps
against the the walls an additional three months will be needed.</P>

<P>9. If the general is unable to control his impatience and orders his
troops to swarm up the walls like ants, one-third of them will be killed
without taking the city. Such is the calamity of these attacks.</P>

<P>10. Thus, those skilled in war subdue the enemy's army without battle.
They capture his cities without assaulting them and overthrowing his state
without protracted operations.</P>

<P>11. Your aim must be to take All-under-Heaven intact. Thus your troops
are not worn out and your gains will be complete. This is the art of offensive
strategy.</P>

<P>12. Consequently, the art of using troops is this: When ten to the enemy's
one, surround him.</P>

<P>13. When five times his strength, attack him;</P>

<P>14. If double his strength, divide him;</P>

<P>15. if equally matched engage him.</P>

<P>16. If weaker numerically, ba capable of withdrawing;</P>

<P>17. And if in all respects unequal, be capable of eluding him, for a
small force is but booty for one more powerful.</P>

<P>18. Now the general is the protector of the state. If this protection
is all-embracing, the state will surely be strong; if defective, the state
will certainly be weak.</P>

<P>19. Now there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon
his army:</P>

<P>20. When ignorant that the army should not advance, to order an advance
or ignorant that is should not retire, to order a retirement. This is described
as 'hobbling the army'.</P>

<P>21. When ignorant of military affairs, to participate in their administration.
This causes officers to be perplexed.</P>

<P>22. When ignorant of command problems to shar ein the exercise of responsibilities.
The engenders doubts in the minds of officers.</P>

<P>23. If the army is confused and suspicious, neighbouring rulers will
cause trouble. This is what is meant by the saying: 'A confused army leads
to another's victory'.</P>

<P>24. Now there are five circumstances in which victory may be predicted:</P>

<P>25. He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious.</P>

<P>26. He who understands how to use both large and small forces will be
victorious.</P>

<P>27. He whose ranks are united in purpose will be victorious.</P>

<P>28. He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will
be victorious.</P>

<P>29. He whose generals are able and not interfered with by the sovereign
will be victorious.</P>

<P>30. It is in these five matters that the way to victory is known.</P>

<P>31. Therefore I&nbsp;say: 'Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred
battles you will never be in peril.</P>

<P>32. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances
of winning or losing are equal.</P>

<P>33. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are certain
in every battle to be in peril.'</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Disposition"></A>Dispositions [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art
Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Anciently the skilful warriors first made themselves invincible and
awaited the enemy's moments of vulnerability.</P>

<P>2. Invincibility depends on one's self; the enemy's vulnerability on
him.</P>

<P>3. It follows that those skilled in war can make themselves invincible
but cannot cause an enemy to be certainly vulnerable.</P>

<P>4. Therefore it is said that one may know how to win, but cannot necessarily
do so.</P>

<P>5. Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in
the attack.</P>

<P>6. One defends when his strength is inadequate; he attacks when it is
abundant.</P>

<P>7. The experts in defence conceal themselves as under the ninefold earth;
those skilled in attack move as from above the ninefold heavens. Thus they
are capable both of protecting themselves and of gaining complete victory.</P>

<P>8. To foresee a victory which the ordinary man can forsee is not the
acme of skill.</P>

<P>9. To triumph inbattle and be universally acclaimed 'Expert' is not
the acme of skill, for to lift an autumn down requires no great strength;
to distinguish between sun and moon is no test of vision; to hear the thunderclap
is no indication of acute hearing.</P>

<P>10. Anciently those called skilled in war conquered an enemy easily
conquered.</P>

<P>11. And therefore the victories won by a master of war gain him neither
reputation for wisdom nor merit for valour.</P>

<P>12. For he wins his victories without erring. 'Withour erring' mean
that whatever he does ensures victory; he conquers an enemy already defeated.</P>

<P>13. Therefore the skilful commander takes up a position in which he
cannot be defeated and misses no opportunity to master his enemy.</P>

<P>14. Thus a victorious army wins its victories before seeking battle;
an army destined to defeat fights in the hope of winning.</P>

<P>15.Those skilled in war cultivate the <I>Tao </I>and preserve the laws
and are therefore able to formulate victorious policies.</P>

<P>16. Now the elements of the art of war are first, measurement of space;
second, estimation of quantities; third, calculations; fourth, comparisons;
and fifth, chances of victory.</P>

<P>17. Measurements of space are derived from the ground.</P>

<P>18. Quantities derive from measurement, figures from quantities, comparisons
from figures, and victory from comparisons.</P>

<P>19. Thus a victorious army is as a hundredweight balanced against a
grainl a defeated army as a grain against a hundredweight.</P>

<P>20. It is because of disposition that a victorious general is able to
make his people fight with pent-p waters which, suddenly released, plunge
into a bottomless abyss.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Energy"></A>Energy [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Generally, management of many is the same as management of a few.
it is a matter of organization.</P>

<P>2. And to control many is the same as to control few. This is a matter
of formations and signals.</P>

<P>3. That the army is certain to sustain the enemy's attack without suffering
defeat is due to operations of the extrordinary and the normal forces.</P>

<P>4. Troops thrown against the enemy as a grindstone against eggs is an
example of a solid acting upon a void.</P>

<P>5. Generally, in battle, use the normal force to engage; use the extraordinary
to win.</P>

<P>6. Now the resources of those skilled in the use of extrordinary forces
are as infinite as the heavens and earth; as inexhaustable as the flow
of the great rivers.</P>

<P>7. For they end and recommence; cyclical, as are the movements of the
sun and moon. They die away and are reborn; recurrent, as are the passing
seasons.</P>

<P>8. The musical notes are only five in number but their melodies are
so numerous that one cannot hear them all. <BR>
(Note from RB&nbsp;here: Western scales have 8 notes, Indian have 22 tones
and semi-tones; had Sun Tzu knew more about music he might have changed
this sentence; 'even with only 22 tones and semitones we (still) have an
infinite number of melodies available' - not too much of a change)</P>

<P>9. The primary colours are only five in number but their combinations
are so infinite that one cannot visualize them all.<BR>
(Note from RB&nbsp;here: Three primary colours Red Green Blue - The PC
monitor you are looking at has only these three and most likely, SVGA with
memory, can produce millions of colours from these; But as in #8 Sun Tzu
is just showing that from a few items a multitude of combinations can be
obtained)</P>

<P>10. The flavours are only five in number but their blends are so various
that one cannot taste them all.</P>

<P>11. In battle there are only the normal and extrordinary forces, but
their combinations are limitless; none can comprehend them all.</P>

<P>12. For these two forces are mutually reproductive; their interaction
as endless as that of interlocked rings. Who can determine where one ends
and the other begins.</P>

<P>13. When torrential water tosses boulders, it is because of momentum;</P>

<P>14. When the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey, it is because
of timing.</P>

<P>15. Thus the momentum of one skilled in war is overwhelming, and his
attack precisely regulated.</P>

<P>16. His potential is that of a fully drawn crossbow; his timing, the
release of the trigger.</P>

<P>17. In the tumult and uproar the battle seems chaotic, but there is
no disorder; the troops appear to be milling about in circles but cannot
be defeated.</P>

<P>18. An apparant confusion is a product of good order; apparent cowardice,
of courage; apparent weakness, of strength.</P>

<P>19. Order or disorder depends on organization; courage or cowardice
on circumstances; strength or weakness on dispositions.</P>

<P>20. Thus, those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a
situation to which he must conform; they intice him with something he is
certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in
strength.</P>

<P>21. Therefore a skilled commander seeks victory from the situation and
does not demand it of his subordinates.</P>

<P>22. He selects his men and they exploit the situation.</P>

<P>23. (Note from RB: The example from #22 was large and either they forgot
to include #23 or they skipped in their numbering of the paragraphs.)</P>

<P>24. he who relies on the situation uses his men in fighting as one rolls
logs or stones. Now the nature of logs or stones is that on stable ground
they are static; on unstable ground, they move. If square, they stop; if
round, they roll.</P>

<P>25. Thus, the potential of troops skilfully commanded in battle may
be compared to that of round boulders which roll down from the mountain
heights.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Weakness and Strengths"></A>Weakness and Strengths [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art
Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Generally, he who occupies the field of battle first and awaits his
enemy is at ease; he who comes later to the scene and rushes into the fight
is weary.</P>

<P>2. And therefore those skilled in war bring the enemy to the field of
battle and are not brought there by him.</P>

<P>3. One able to make the enemy come to his own accord does so by offering
him some advantage. And one able to prevent him from coming does so by
hurting him.</P>

<P>4. When the enemy is at ease, be able to weary him; when well fed, to
starve him; when at rest, to make him move.</P>

<P>5. Appear at places to which he must hasten; move swifty where he does
not expect you.</P>

<P>6. That you travel a thousand li without wearying yourself is because
you travel where there is no enemy.</P>

<P>7. To be certain to take what you attack is to attack a place the enemy
does not protect. To be certain to hold what you defend is to defend a
place the enemy does not attack.</P>

<P>8. Therefore, against those skilled in attack, an enemy doe snot know
ehre to defend; against the experts in defence, the enemy does not know
where to attack.</P>

<P>9. Subtle and insubstantial, the expert leaves no trace; divinely mysterious,
he is inaudible. Thus he is master of his enemy's fate.</P>

<P>10. He whose advance is irresistable plunges into his enemy's weak positions;
he who in withdrawal cannot be pursued moves so swiftly that he cannot
be overtaken.</P>

<P>11. When I wish to give battle, my enemy, even though protected by high
walls and deep moats, cannot help but engage me, for I attack a position
he must succour.</P>

<P>12. When I wish to avoid battle I may defend myself simply by drawing
a line on the ground; the enemy will be unable to attack me because I divert
him from going where he wishes.</P>

<P>13. If I am able to determine the enemy's dispositions while at the
same time I conceal my own then I can concentrate and he must divide. And
if I concentrate while he divides, I can use my entire strength to attack
a fraction of his. There, I will be numerically superior. Then, if I am
able to use many to strike few at the selected point, those I deal with
will be in dire straits.</P>

<P>14. The enemy must not know where I intend to give battle. For if he
does not know where I intend to give battle he must prepare in a great
many places. And when he prepares in a great many places, those I have
to fight in any one place will be few.</P>

<P>15. For if he prepares to the front his rear will be weak, and if to
the rear, his front will be fragile. If he prepares to the left, his right
will be vulnerable and if to the right, there will be few on his left.
And when he prepares everywhere he will be weak everwhere.</P>

<P>16. One who has few must prepare against the enemy; one who has many
makes the enemy prepare against him.</P>

<P>17. If one knows where and when a battle will be fought this troops
can march a thousand <I>li</I> and meet on the field. But if one knows
neither the battleground nor the day of battle, the left will be unable
to aid the right, or the right, the left; the van to support the rear,
or the rear, the van. How much more is this so when separated by several
tens of <I>li</I>, or , indeed, by even a few.</P>

<P>18. Although I estimate the troops of Yueh as many, of what benefit
is this superiority in respect to the outcome?</P>

<P>19. Thus I&nbsp;say that victory can be created. For even if the enemy
is numerous, I&nbsp;can prevent him from engaging.</P>

<P>20. Therefore, determine the enemy's plans and you will know which strategy
will be successful and which will not;</P>

<P>21. Agitate him and ascertain the pattern of his movement.</P>

<P>22. Determine his dispositions and so ascertain the field of battle.</P>

<P>23. Probe him and learn where his strength is abundant and where deficient.</P>

<P>24. The ultimate in disposing one's troops is to be without ascertainable
shape. The the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay
plans against you.</P>

<P>25. It is according to the shapes that I lay the plans for victory,
but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the
outward aspects, none understands the way in which I have created victory.</P>

<P>26. Therefore, when I have won a victory I do not repeat my tactics
but respond to circumstances in an infinite variety of ways.</P>

<P>27. Now an army may be likened to water, for just as flowing water avoids
the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and
strikes weakness.</P>

<P>28. And as water shapes its flow in accordance with the ground, so an
army manages its victory in accordance with the situation of the enemy.</P>

<P>29. And as water has no constant form, there are in war no constant
conditions.</P>

<P>30. Thus, one able to gain victory by modifying his tactics in accordance
with the enemy situation may be said to be divine.</P>

<P>31. Of the five elements, none is always predominant; of the four seasons,
none lasts forever; of the days, some are long and some are short, and
the moon waxes and wanes.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Manoevre"></A>Manoeuvre [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Normally, when the army is employed, the general first receives his
commands from the sovereign. He assembles the troops and mobilizes the
people. He blends the army into a harmonious entity and encamps it.</P>

<P>2. Nothing is more difficult that the art of manoeuvre. What is difficult
about manoeuvre is to make the devious route the most direct and to turn
misfortune into advantage.</P>

<P>3. Thus, march by an indirect route and diveret the enemy bu enticing
him with bait. So doing, you may set out after he does and arrive before
him. One able to do this understands the strategy of the direct and the
indirect.</P>

<P>4. Now both advantage and danger are inherent in manoeuvre.</P>

<P>5. One who setsthe entire army in motion to chase an advantage will
not attain it.</P>

<P>6. If he abandons the camp to contend for advanatge the stores will
be lost.</P>

<P>7. It follows that when one rolls up the armour and sets out speedily,
stopping neither day nor night and marching at double time for a hundred
li, the three commanders will be captured. For the vigorous troops will
arrive first and the feeble straggle along behind, so that if this method
is used only one-tenth of the army will arrive.</P>

<P>8. In a forced march of fifty li the commander of the van will fall,
and using this method half the army will arrive. In a forced march of thirty
li, but two-thirds will arrive.</P>

<P>9. It follows that an army which lacks heavy equipment, fodder, food
and stores will be lost.</P>

<P>10. Those who do not know the conditions of mountains and forests, hazardous
defiles, marshes and swamps, cannot conduct the march of an army;</P>

<P>11. Those who do not use local guides are unable to obtain the advantages
of the ground.</P>

<P>12. Now war is based on deception. move when it is advantageous and
create changes in the situation by dispersal and concentration of forces.</P>

<P>13. When campaigning, be swift as the wind; in leisurely march, majestic
as the forest; in raiding and plundering, like fire; in standing, firm
as the mountains. As unfathomable as the clouds, move like a thunderbolt.</P>

<P>14. When you plunder the countryside, divide your forces. When you conquer
territory, divide the profits.</P>

<P>15. Weigh the situation, then move.</P>

<P>16. He who knows the art of the direct and the indirect approach will
be victorious. Such is the art of manoeuvring.</P>

<P>17. The Book of Military Administration says: 'As the voice cannot be
heard in battle, drums and bells are used. As troops cannot see each other
clearly in battle, flags and banners are used.</P>

<P>18. Now gongs and drums, banners and flags are used to focus the attention
of the troops. When the troops can be thus united, the brave cannot advance
alone, nor can the cowardly withdraw. This is the art of employing a host.</P>

<P>19. In night fighting use many torches and drums, in day fighting many
banners and flags in order to influence the sight and hearing of our troops.</P>

<P>20. Now an army may be robbed of its spirit and its commander deprived
of his courage.</P>

<P>21. During the early morning spirits are keen, during the day they flag,
and in the evening thoughts turn toward home.</P>

<P>22. And therefor those skilled in war avoid the enemy when his spirit
is keen and attack him when it is sluggish and his soldiers hoomesick.
This is control of the moral factor.</P>

<P>23. In good order they await a disorderly enemy; in serenity, a clamorous
one. This is control of the mental factor.</P>

<P>24. Close to the field of battle, they await an enemy coming from afar;
at rest, an exhausted enemy; with well-fed troops, hungry ones. This is
control of the physical factor.</P>

<P>25. They do not engae an enemy advancing with well ordered banners nor
one whose formations are in impressive array. This is control of the factor
of changing circumstances.</P>

<P>26. Therefore, the art of employing troops is that when the enemy occupies
high ground, do not confront him; with his back resting on hills, do not
oppose him.</P>

<P>27. When he pretneds to flee, do not pursue him.</P>

<P>28. Do not attack his <I>elite </I>troops.</P>

<P>29. Do not gobble proferred baits.</P>

<P>30. Do not thwart an enemy returning homewards.</P>

<P>31. To a surrounded enemy you must leave a way of escape.</P>

<P>32. Do not press an enemy at bay.</P>

<P>33. This is the method of employing troops.</P>

<H3><A NAME="The Nine Variables"></A>The Nine Variables [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art
Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. In general, the system of employing troops is that the commander
receives his mandate from the sovreign to mobilize the people and assemble
the army.</P>

<P>2. You should not encamp in low-lying land.</P>

<P>3. In communicating ground, unite with your allies.</P>

<P>4. You should not linger in desolate ground.</P>

<P>5. In enclosed ground, resourcefulness is required.</P>

<P>6. In death ground, fight.</P>

<P>7. The are some roads not to follow; some troops not to strike; some
cities not to assault; and some ground which should not be contested.</P>

<P>8. There are occasions when the commands of the sovereign need not be
obeyed.</P>

<P>9. A general thoroughly versed in the advantages of the nine variable
factors knows how to employ troops.</P>

<P>10. The general who does not understand the advantages of the ninie
variable factors willnot be able to use the ground to his advantage even
though familiar with it.</P>

<P>11. In the direction of military operations one who does not understand
the tactics suitable to the nine variable situations will be unable to
use his troops effectively, even if he understands the five advantages.</P>

<P>12. And for this reason, the wise general in his deliberations must
consider both favourable and unfavourable factors.</P>

<P>13. By taking into account the favourable factors, he makes his plan
feasible; by taking into account the unfavourable, he may resolve the difficulties.</P>

<P>14. He who intimidates his neighbours does so by inflicting injury upon
them.</P>

<P>15. He wearies them by keepng them constantly occupied, and makes them
rush about by offering them ostensible advantages.</P>

<P>16. It is a doctrine of war not to assume the enemy will not come, but
rather to rely on one's readiness to meet him; not to presume that he will
not attack, but rather to make one's self invincible.</P>

<P>17. There are five qualities which are dangerous in the character of
a general.</P>

<P>18. If reckless, he can be killed.</P>

<P>19. If cowardly, captured.</P>

<P>20. If quick-tempered you can make a fool of him;</P>

<P>21. If he has too delicate a sense of honour you can calumniate him;
</P>

<P>22. If he is of a compasionate nature you can harass him.</P>

<P>23. Now these five traits of character are serious faults in a general
and in military operations are calamitous.</P>

<P>24. The ruin of the army and the death of the general are inevitable
results of these shortcomings. They must be deeply pondered.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Marches"></A>Marches [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Generally when taking up a position and confronting the enemy, having
crossed the mountains, stay close to valleys. Encamp on high ground facing
the sunny side.</P>

<P>2. Fight downhill; do not ascend to attack.</P>

<P>3. So much for taking a position in mountains.</P>

<P>4. After crossing a river you must move some distance away from it.</P>

<P>5. When an advancing enemy crosses water do not meet him at the water's
edge. It is advantageous to allow half his force to cross and then strike.</P>

<P>6. If you wish to give battle, do not confront your enemy close to the
water. Take position on high ground facing the sunlight. Do not take position
downstream.</P>

<P>7. This relates to taking up positions near a river.</P>

<P>8. cross salt marshes speedily. Do not linger in them. If you encounter
the enemy in the middle of a salt marsh you must take position close to
grass and water with trees to your rear.</P>

<P>9. This has to do with taking up position in salt marshes.</P>

<P>10. In level ground occupy a position which facilitates your action.
With heights to your rear and right, the field of battle is to the front
and the rear is safe.</P>

<P>11. This is how to take up position on level ground.</P>

<P>12. Generally, these are advantageous for encamping in four situations
named. By using them the Yellow Emporer conquered your sovereigns.</P>

<P>13. An army prefers high ground to low; esteems sunlight and dislikes
shade. Thus, while nourishing its health, the army occupies a firm position.
An army that does not suffer from countless diseases is said to be certain
of victory.</P>

<P>14. When near mounds, foothills, dikes or embankments, you must take
position on the sunny side and rest your right and rear on them.</P>

<P>15. These methods are all advantageous for the army, and gain the help
the ground affords.</P>

<P>16. Where there are preci[itous torrents, 'Heavenly Wells', 'Heavenly
Prisions', 'Heavenly Nets', 'Heavenly Traps', and 'Heavenly Cracks', you
must march speedily away from them. Do not approach them.</P>

<P>17. I&nbsp;keep a distance from these and draw the enemy toward them.
I&nbsp;face them and cause him to put his back to them.</P>

<P>18. When on the flanks of the army there are dangerous defiles or ponds
covered with aquatic grasses where reeds and rushes grow, or forested mountains
with dense tangled undergrowth you must carefully search them out, for
these are places where ambushes are laid and spies are hidden.</P>

<P>19. When an enemy is near by but lying low he is depending on a favourable
position. When he challenges to battle from afar he wishes to lure you
to advance, for when he is in easy ground he is in an advantageous position.</P>

<P>20. When the trees are seen to move the enemy is advancing.</P>

<P>21. When many obstacles have been placed in the undergrowth, it is for
the purpose of deception.</P>

<P>22. Birds rising in flight is a sign that the enemy is lying in ambush;
when the wild animals are startled and flee he is trying to make you unaware.</P>

<P>23. Dust spurting upward in high straight columns indictaes the approach
of chariots. When it hangs low and is widespread infantry is approaching.</P>

<P>24. When dust rises in scattered areas the enemy is bringing in firewood;
when there are numerous small patches which seem to come and go he is encamping
the army.</P>

<P>25. When the enemy's envoys speak in humble terms, but he continues
his preparations, he will advance.</P>

<P>26. When their language is deceptive but the enemy pretentiously advances,
he will retreat.</P>

<P>27. When the envoys speak in apologetic terms, he wishes a respite.</P>

<P>28. When without a previous understanding the enemy asks for a truce,
he is plotting.</P>

<P>29. When lkight chariots first go out and take up position on the flanks
the enemy is forming for battle.</P>

<P>30. When his troops march speedily and he parades his battle chariots
he is expecting to rendezvous with reinforcements.</P>

<P>31. When half his force advances and half withdraws he is attempting
to decoy you.</P>

<P>32. When his troops lean on their weapons, they are famished.</P>

<P>33. When drawers of water drink before carrying it to camp, his troops
are suffering from thirst.</P>

<P>34. When the enemy sees an advantage but does not advance to seize it,
he is fatigued.</P>

<P>35. When birds gather above his camp sites, they are empty.</P>

<P>36. When at night the enemy's camp is clamorous, he is fearful.</P>

<P>37. When his troops are disorderly, the general has no prestige.</P>

<P>38. When his flags and banners move about constantly he is in disarray.</P>

<P>39. If the officers are short-tempered they are exhausted.</P>

<P>40. When the enemy feeds grain to the horses and his men meat and when
his troops neither hang up their cooking pots nor return to their shelters,
the enemy is desparate.</P>

<P>41. When the troops continually gather insmall groups and whisper together
the general has lost the confidence of the army.</P>

<P>42. Too frequent rewards indicate that the general is at the end of
his resources; too frequent punishments that he is in acute distress.</P>

<P>43. If the officers at first treat the men violently and later are fearful
of them, the limit of indiscipline has been reached.</P>

<P>44. When the enemy troops are high in spirits, and , although facing
you, do not join in battle for along time, nor leave, you must thoroughly
investigate the situation.</P>

<P>45. In war, numbers alone confer no advantage. Do not advance relying
on sheer military power.</P>

<P>46. It is sufficient to estimate the enemy situation correctly and to
concentrate your strength to capture him. There is no more to it tan this.
he who lacks foresight and underestimates his enemy will surely be captured
by him.</P>

<P>47. If troops are punished before their loyalty is secured they will
be disobedient. If not obedient, it is difficult to employ them. If troops
are loyal, nut punishments are not enforced, you cannot employ them.</P>

<P>48. Thus, command them with civility and imbue them uniforml with martial
ardour and it may be said that victory is certain.</P>

<P>49. If orders which are consistently effective are used in instructing
the troops, they will be obedient. If orders which are not consistently
effective are used in instructing them, they will be disobedient.</P>

<P>50. When orders are consistently trustworthy and observed, the relationship
of a commander with his troops is satisfactory.</P>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="Terrain"></A>Terrain [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Ground may be classified according to its nature as accessible, entrapping,
indecisive, constricted, precipitous, and distant.</P>

<P>2. Ground which both we and the enemy can traverse with equal ease is
called accessible. In such ground, he who first takes high sunny posiitons
convenient to his supply routes can fight advantageously.</P>

<P>3. Ground easy to get out of but difficult to return to is entrapping.
The nature of this ground is such if the enemy is unprepared and you sally
out you may defeat him. if the enemy is prepared and you go out and engage,
but do not win, it is difficult to return. This is unprofitable.</P>

<P>4. Ground equally disadvantageous for both the enemy and ourselves to
enter is indecisive. The nature of this ground is such that although the
enemy holds out a bait I do not go forth but entice him by marching off.
When I have drawn out half his force, I can strike him advantageously.
</P>

<P>5. If I first occupy constricted ground I must block the passes and
await the enemy. if the enemy first occupies such ground and blocks defiles
I should not follow him; if he does not block them completely I may do
so.</P>

<P>6. In precipitous ground I must take position on the sunny heights and
await the enemy. If he first occupies such ground I lure him by marching
off; I do not follow him.</P>

<P>7. When at a distance from an enemy of equal strength it is difficult
to provoke battle and unprofitable to engage him in his chosen position.</P>

<P>8. These are the principles relating to six different types of ground.
It is the highest responsibility of the general to inquire into them with
the utmost care.</P>

<P>9. Now when troops flee, are insubordinate, distressed, collapse in
disorder or are routed, it is the fault of the general. Noen of these disasters
can be attributed too natural causes.</P>

<P>10. Other conditions being equal, if a force attacks one ten times its
size, the result is flight.</P>

<P>11. When troops are strong and officers weak the army is insubordinate.</P>

<P>12. When the officers are valient and the troops ineffective the army
is in distress.</P>

<P>13. When senior officers are angry and insubordinate, and on encountering
the enemy rush into battle with no understanding of the feasibility of
engaging and without awaiting orders from the commander, the army is in
a state of collapse.</P>

<P>14. When the general is morally weak and his discipline not strict,
when his instructions and guidance are not enlightened, when there are
no consistent rules to guide the officers and men and when the formations
are slovenly the army is in disorder.</P>

<P>15. When a cpmmander unable to estimate his enemy uses a small force
to engage a large one, or weak troops to strikethe strong, or when he fails
to select chock troops for the van, the result is route.</P>

<P>16. When any of these six conditions prevails the army is on the road
to defeat. It is the highest responsibility of the general that he examine
them carefully.</P>

<P>17. Conformation of the ground is of the greatest assisstance in battle.
Therefore, to estimate the enemy situation and to calculate distances and
the degree of difficulty of the terrain so as to control victory are virtues
of the superior general. He who fights with full knowledge of these factors
is certain to win; he who does not will surely be defeated.</P>

<P>18. If the situtation is one of victory but the sovereign has issued
orders not to engage, the general may decide to fight. If the situation
is such that he cannot win, but the sovereign has issued orders to engage,
he need not do so.</P>

<P>19. And therefore the general who in advancing does not seek peroanl
fame, and in withdrawing is not concerned with avoiding punishment, but
whose only purpose is to protect the people and promote the best interests
of hos sovereign, is the precious jewel of the state.</P>

<P>20. Because such a general regards his men as infants they will march
with him into the deepest valleys. He treats them as his own beloved sons
and they will die with him.</P>

<P>21. If a general indulges his troops but is unable to employ them; if
he loves them but cannot enforce his commands; if the troops are disorderly
and he is unable to control them, they may be compared to spoiled children,
and are useless.</P>

<P>22. If I know that my troops are capable of striking the enemy, but
do not know that he is invulnerable to attack, my chance of victory is
but half.</P>

<P>23. If I know that the enemy is vulnerable to attack, but do not know
that my troops are incapable of striking him, my chance of victory is but
half.</P>

<P>24. If I know that the enemy can be attacked and that my troops are
capable of attacking him, but do not realize that because of the conformation
of the ground I should not attack, my chance of victory is but half.</P>

<P>25. Therefore when those experienced in war move they make no mistakes;
when they act, their resources are limitless.</P>

<P>26. And therefore I say:&nbsp;'Know the nemy, know yourself; your victory
will never be endangered. Know the ground, know the weather; your victory
will then be total.'</P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="The Nine Varieties of Ground"></A>The Nine Varieties of Ground
[<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. In respect to the employment of troops, ground may be clasified as
dispersive, frontier, key, communicating, focal, serious, difficult, encircled,
and death.</P>

<P>2. When a fuedal lord fights in his own territoriy, he is in dispersive
ground.</P>

<P>3. When he makes but a shallow penetration into enemy territory he is
in frontier ground.</P>

<P>4. Ground equally advantageous for th enemy or me to occupy is key ground.</P>

<P>5. Ground equally accessible to both the enemy and me is communicating.</P>

<P>6. When a state is enclosed by three other states its territory is focal.
He who first gets control of it will gain the support of All-under-Heaven.</P>

<P>7. When the army has penetrated deep into hostile territory, leaving
far behind many enemy cities and towns, it is in serious ground.</P>

<P>8. When the army traverses mountains, forests, precipitous country,
or marches through defiles, marshlands, or swamps, or any place where the
going is hard, it is difficult ground.</P>

<P>9. Ground to which access is constricted, where the way out is tortuous,
and where a small enemy force can strike my larger one is called 'encircled'.</P>

<P>10. Ground in which the army survives onlu if it fights with the courage
of desperation is called 'death'.</P>

<P>11. And therefore, do not fight in dispersive ground; do not stop in
frontier borderlands.</P>

<P>12. Do not attack an enemy who occupies key ground; in communicating
ground do not allow youor formations to become separated.</P>

<P>13. In focal ground, ally with neighbouring states; in deep ground,
plunder.</P>

<P>14. In difficult ground, presson; in encircled ground, devise strategems;
in death ground, fight.</P>

<P>15. In dispersive ground I would unify the determination of the army.</P>

<P>16. In frontier ground I would keep my forces closely linked.</P>

<P>17. In key ground I would hasten up my rear elements.</P>

<P>18. In communicating ground I would pay strict attention to my defences.</P>

<P>19. In focal ground I would strengthen my allaiances.</P>

<P>20. In serious ground I would ensure a continuous flow of provisions.</P>

<P>21. In difficult ground I would press on over the roads.</P>

<P>22. In encircled ground I would block the points of access and egress.</P>

<P>23. In death ground I&nbsp;could make it evident that there is no chance
of survival. For it is the nature of soldiers to resist when surrounded;
to fight to the death when there is no alternative, and when desperate
to follow commands implicitly.</P>

<P>24. The tactical variations appropriate to the nine types of ground,
the advantages of close or extended deployment, and the oprinciples of
human nature are matters the general must examine with the greatest care.</P>

<P>25. Anciently, those described as skilled in war made it impossible
for the enemy to unite his van and his rear; for his elements both large
and small to mutually co-operate; for the good troops to succour the poor
and for superiors and subordinates to support each other.</P>

<P>26. When the enemy's forces were dispersed they prevented him from assembling
them; when concentrated, they threw him into confusion.</P>

<P>27. They concentrated and moved when it was advantageous to do so; when
not advantageous, they halted.</P>

<P>28. Should one ask:&nbsp;'How do I cope with a well-ordered enemy host
about to attack me?' I reply:&nbsp;'Seize something he cherishes and he
will conform to your desires'.</P>

<P>29. Speed is the essence of war. Take advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness;
travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions.</P>

<P>30. The general principles applicable to an invading force are that
when you have penetrated deeply into hostile territory your army is united,
and the defender cannot overcome you.</P>

<P>31. Plunder fertile country to supply the army with plentiful provisions.</P>

<P>32. Pay heed to nourishing the troops; do not unnecessarily fatigue
them. Unite them in spirit; conserve their strength. Make unfathomable
plans for the movements of the amry.</P>

<P>33. Throw the troops into a position from which there is no escape and
even when faced with death they will not flee. For if prepared to die,
hwat can they not achieve? The officers and men together put forth their
utmost o\efforts. In a desperate situation they fear nothing; when there
is no way out they stand firm. Deep in a hostile land they are bound together,
and there, where there is no alternative, they will engage the enemy in
hand to hand combat.</P>

<P>34. Thus, such troops need no encouragement to be vigilant. Without
extorting their supprot the general obtains it; without inviting their
affection he gains it; without demanding their trust he wins it.</P>

<P>35. my officers have no surplus of wealth but no because they disdain
worldly goods; they have no expectation of long life but not because they
dislike longevity.</P>

<P>36. On a day the army is orderd to march the tears of those seated soak
their lapeld; the tears of those reclining course down their cheeks.</P>

<P>37. But throw them into a situation where there is no escape and they
will display the immortal courage of Chuan Chu and Ts'ao Kuei.</P>

<P>38. Now the troops of those adept in war are used like the 'Simultaneously
Responding' snake of Mount Ch'ang. When struck on the head its tail attacks;
when struck on the tail, its head attacks, when struck in the center both
head and tail attack.</P>

<P>39. Should one aks: 'Can troops be made capable of such instantaneous
co-ordination?' I reply: 'They can'. For, although the men of Wu and Yueh
mutually hate one another if together in a boat tossed bt the wind they
would co-operate as the right hand does with the left.'</P>

<P>40. it is thus not sufficient to place one's reliance on hobbled horses
or burried chariot wheels.</P>

<P>41. To cultivate a uniform level of valour is the object of military
administration. And it is by proper use of the ground that boith shock
and flexible forces are used to the best advantage.</P>

<P>42. It is the business of a general to be serene and inscrutable, impartial
and self-controlled.</P>

<P>43. He should be capable of keeping his officers and men in ignorance
of his plans.</P>

<P>44. He prohibits superstitious practices and so rids the army of doubts.
Then until the moment of death there can be no troubles.</P>

<P>45. He changes his methods and alters his plans so that people have
no knowledge of what he is doing.</P>

<P>46. He alters his camp-sites and marches by devious routes, and thus
makes it impossible for others to anticipate his purpose.</P>

<P>47. To assemble the army and throw it into a desparate position is the
business of the general.</P>

<P>48. He leads the army deep into hostile territory and releases the trigger.</P>

<P>49. He burns his boats and smashes his cooking pots; he urges the army
on as if driving a flock of sheep, now in one direction, now in another,
and none knows where he is going.</P>

<P>50. He fixes a date for rendezvous and after the troops have met, cuts
off their return route just as if he were removing a ladder from beneath
them.</P>

<P>51. One ignorant of the plans of neighbouring states cannot prepare
alliances in good time; if ignorant of the conditions of mountains, forests,
dangerous defiles, swamps and marshes he cannot conduct the march of an
army; if he fails to make use of native guides he cannot gain the advantages
of the ground. A general ignorant of even one of these three matters is
unfit to command the armies of a Hegemonic King.</P>

<P>52. now when a hegemonic King attacks a powerful state he makes it impossible
for the enemy to concentrate. He overawes the enemy and prevents his allies
from joining him.</P>

<P>53. It follows that he does not contend against powerful combinations
nor does he foster the power of other states. He relies for the attainment
of his aims on his ability to overawe his opponenents. And so he can take
the enemy's cities and overthrow the enemy's state.</P>

<P>54. Bestow rewards without respect to customary practice; publish orders
without respect to precedent. Thus you may employ the entire army as you
would one man.</P>

<P>55. Set the troops to their tasks without imparting your designs; use
them to gain advantage without revealing the dangers involved. Throw them
inot a perilous situation and they survive; put them in death ground and
they will live. For when the army is placed in such a situation it can
snatch victory from defeat.</P>

<P>56. Now the crux of military operations lies in the pretence of accomodating
one's self to the designs of the enemy.</P>

<P>57. Concentrate your forces against the enemy and from a distance of
a thousand li you can kill his general. This is described as the ability
to attain one's aim in an artful and ingenious manner.</P>

<P>58. On the day the policy to attack is put into effect, close the passes,
rescind the passports, have no further intercourse with the enemy's envoys
and exhort the temple council to execute the plans.</P>

<P>59. When the enemy presents an opportunity, speedily take advantage
of it. Anticipate him in seizing something he values and move in accordance
with a date secretly fixed.</P>

<P>60. The doctrine of war is to follow the enemy situation in order to
decide on battle.</P>

<P>61. Therefore at first be shy as a maiden. When the enemy gives you
an opening be swift as a hare and he will be unable to withstand you.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Attack by Fire"></A>Attack by Fire [<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art
Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. There are five methods of attacking with fire. The first is to burn
personnel; the second, to burn stores; the third, to burn equipment; the
fourth, to burn arsenals; and the fifth, to use incendiary missiles.</P>

<P>2. To use fire, some medium must be relied upon.</P>

<P>3. Equipment for setting fires must always be at hand.</P>

<P>4. There are suitable times and appropriate days on which to raise fires.</P>

<P>5. &quot;Times' means when the weather is scorching hot; 'days' means
when the moon is in Sagittarius, Alpharatz, <I>I</I> or <I>Chen </I>constellations,
for these are days of rising winds.</P>

<P>6. Now in fire attacks one must respond to the changing situation.</P>

<P>7. When fire breaks out in the enemy's camp immediately co-ordinate
your action from without. But if his troops remain calm bbide your time
and do not attack.</P>

<P>8. When the fire reaches its height, follow up if you can. If you cannot
do so, wait.</P>

<P>9. If you can raise fires outside the enemy camp, it is not necessary
to wait until they are started inside. Set fires at suitable times.</P>

<P>10. When fires are raised up-wind do not attack from down-wind.</P>

<P>11. When the wind blows during the day it will die down at night.</P>

<P>12. Now the army must know the five different fire-attack situations
and be constantly vigilant.</P>

<P>13. Those who use fire to assist their attacks are intelligent; those
who use inundations are powerful.</P>

<P>14. Water can isolate an enemy but cannot destroy fhis supplis or equipment.</P>

<P>15 Now to win battles and take your objectives, but fail to exploit
these achievements is ominous and may be described as 'wasteful delay'.</P>

<P>16. And therefor it is said that enlightened rulers deliberate upon
the plans, and good generals execute them.</P>

<P>17. If not in the interests of the state, do not act. If you cannot
succeed, do not use troops. If you are not in danger, do not fight.</P>

<P>18. A sovereign cannot raise an army because he is enraged, nor can
a general fight because he is resentful. For while an angered man may again
be happy, a resentful man again be pleased, a state that has perished cannot
be restored, nor can the dead be brought back to life.</P>

<P>19. Therefore, the enlightened ruler is prudent and the good general
is warned against rash action. Thus the state is kept secure and the army
preserved.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="Employment of Secret Agents"></A>Employment of Secret Agents
[<A HREF="#The Art of War">Art Index</A>]</H3>

<P>1. Now when an army of one hundred thousand is rasied and dispatched
on a distant campaign the expenses borne by the people together with the
disbursements of the treasury will amount to a thousand pieces of gold
daily. There will be continuous commotion both at home and abroad, people
will be exhausted by the requirements of transport, and the affairs of
seven hundred thousand households will be disrupted.</P>

<P>2. One who confronts his enemy for many years in order to struggle for
victory in a decisive battle yet who, because he begrudges rank, honours
and a few hundred pieces of gold, remains ignorant of his enemy's situation,
is completely devoid of humanity. Such a man is no general; no support
to his soveriegn; no master of victory.</P>

<P>3. Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer
the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary
men is foreknowledge.</P>

<P>4. What is called 'foreknowledge' cannot be elicited from spirits, nor
from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from calculations. It must
be obtained from men who know the enemy situation.</P>

<P>5. Now there are five sorts of secret agents to be employed. These are
native, inside, doubled, expendable, and living.</P>

<P>6. When these five types of agents are all working simultaneously and
none knows their method of operation, they are called 'The Devine Skein'
and are the treasure of a sovereign.</P>

<P>7. Native agents are those of the enemy's country people whom we employ.</P>

<P>8. Inside agents are enemy officials whom we employ.</P>

<P>9. Doubled agents are enemy spies whom we employ.</P>

<P>10. Expendable agents are those of our own spies who are deliberately
given fabricated information.</P>

<P>11. Living agents are those who return with information.</P>

<P>12. Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate
than the secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given
to the secret agents; of all matters none more confidential than those
relating to secret operations.</P>

<P>13. He who is not sage and wise, humane and just, cannot use secret
agents. And he who is not delicate and subtle cannot get the truth out
of them.</P>

<P>14. Delicate indeed! Truly delicate! There is no place where espionage
is not used.</P>

<P>15. If plans relating to secret operations are prematurely divulged
the agent and all those to whom he spoke of them shall be put to death.</P>

<P>16. Generally in the case of armies you wish to strike, cities you wish
to attack, and people you wish to assassinate, you must know the names
of the garrison commander, the staff officers, the ushers, gate keepers,
and the bodyguards. You must instruct your agents to inquire into these
matters in minute detail.</P>

<P>17. It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct
espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions
and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used.</P>

<P>18. It is by means of the doubled agent that native and inside agents
can be recruited and employed.</P>

<P>19. And it by this means that the expendable agent, armed with false
information, can be sent to convey it to the enemy.</P>

<P>20. It is by this means also that living agents can be used at appropriate
times.</P>

<P>21. The sovereign must have full knowledge of the activities of the
five sorts of agents. This knowledge must come from the doubled agents,
and therefore it is mandatory that they be treated with the utmost liberality.</P>

<P>22. Of old, the rise of Yin was due to I&nbsp;Chih, who formerly served
the Hsia; the Chou came to power through Lu Yu, a servant of the Yin.</P>

<P>23. And therefore only the enlightened sovereign and the worthy general
who are able to use the most intelligent people as agents are certain to
achieve great things. Secret operations are essential in war; upon them
the army relies to make its every move.</P>

<P>End.</P>
