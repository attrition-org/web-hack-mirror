<p align="center">Give it up P4nt3r4, you're still the same lamer that got
kicked out of Ph33r-the-b33r and you always will be. I'm glad to see you found
other people that could hax0r 3r33t linux boxen since all you seemed to be able
to do was run other people's msadc2.pl scripts. Anyways, as to what I think of
your all out &quot;war&quot; on capitalism I think it's just your lame excuse
for not having a life and having nothing better to do with your pathetic
existence, and frankly, it's just sad. So... a big fsck /dev/hackweiser to you
and your lame friends.</p>
