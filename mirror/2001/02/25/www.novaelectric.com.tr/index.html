This site was done to display a couple thoughts. These were inspired by bl4f.
<br> 
Mainly what I wanted to comment on was the bashing of lower level domains being defaced and simple exploits being used to do them. Whats wrong with defacing lower level domains? If we hack a high level computer, we keep it - theres better things to be done with it, and im sure thats what other groups do also.
<br> 
Second, whats wrong with using simple exploits such as wu, bind, sadm, etc? Sure we hack other vuln as well, but if theres a simple security hole, why not use that?
<br> 
This wasnt said to start anything, or bash anyone, just point out that sometimes, some groups just like to deface all kinds of shit to have a little fun and start some good old fashion trouble *grin*
<br> 
<br> 
We dig you hacks bl4f, as well as hackweisers, and several others and encourage you all to keep it up - maybe just be a little bit more cool with each other.The only gay one are the ones acting like their hacks are taking over the world and liberating countries. keep it real kids.
