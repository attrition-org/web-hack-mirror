<hr>

<p>In 1986, due to a back injury, <font color="red">George Hall </font>, founder and
President of Paras Scandic International, Inc. was considered to be 80% permanently
partially disabled. George was certified by two orthopedic surgeons and one neurosurgeon
as having a degenerative herniated disk. This was a result of one CAT scan and 2 MRI's.
Doctors wanted George to have surgery. </p>

<p>At that time, George elected not to have surgery. He had to stop working in November
1985 due to his medical condition. For the next few months he tried various therapies
including <font color="red">traction, physical rehabilitation, ultra-sound, acupuncture
and chiropractic help. (2 Chiropractors 5 days a week) </font></p>

<p>During that time, George lost 50 lbs. When it all provided little or no relief, he
began searching for a topical cream to relieve the pain. The pain was associated with the
inflammation. He needed something to address the pain and inflammation through increased
circulation which removes the waste and brings in oxygen and nutrients to the injury to
promote the healing process. </p>

<p>Oral and anti-inflammatory pain medication did nothing except irritate his stomach. Due
to a sudden change in his family situation George decided to move to Stockholm, Sweden,
joining his wife there. </p>

<p>In Sweden, George began to search for a natural topical analgesic to relieve his pain
without negative side effects like what normal medications would give. In the beginning of
1989 George found a company that had a product. After using it for a couple of weeks he
noticed a dramatic improvement in his physical condition. </p>

<p>When George began to understand the importance of the circulatory system in relation to
the neuromuscular system and how they work to accomplish the healing process, he knew that
Swedish Sports Rub was the only product that accomplished this. After extensive research
and development, George perfected the amazing product called Swedish Sports Rub. The
benefits of the product are proven in test after test.</p>

<p>George acquired the rights to the product and began to test and evaluate its various
types of acute and chronic muscle and joint related pain. The tests were conducted in
Sweden, Finland and the USA in 1990 - 1995. </p>

<p>Due to George's family situation, he relocated back to New York from Stockholm in the
mid 90's. To focus and bring to the consumer market Swedish Sports Rub.</p>
