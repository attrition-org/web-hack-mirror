<p>OVERUSE INJURIES</font><br>
SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® is an all-natural homeopathic cream developed in Sweden. It
penetrates deep, is odorless and does not irritate the skin. .</p>

<p>For over a decade, the U.S. has been experiencing a fitness and sports boom. More than
two-thirds of Americans exercise regularly, according to a Gallup-American Health survey.
However, while research indicates that regular exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular
diseases and promotes healthier living, there is also a downside. Aches and pains caused
by &quot;overdoing it&quot; are very common and each year Americans suffer from 17 million
sports-related injuries. (U.S. News and World Report, 31 july, 1989)</p>

<p>So how does one reap the benefits of sports and exercise while minimizing the risk of
injury and pain?</p>

<p>Years of scientific research and clinical testing (FDA Registered NDC 58422-0001/1)
have resulted in SWEDISH SPORTS RUB®, an effective supplement of serious athletic
training programs for the prevention of and recovery from injuries and intensive workouts.</p>

<p><font SIZE="4" COLOR="RED">SORENESS AND STIFFNESS</font><br>
Soreness and stiffness in exercised muscles and joints are often experienced by both
professional athletes and &quot;WEEKEND WARRIORS.&quot; From a scientific perspective, any
one of at least four factors may be a causative agent: 

<ul>
  <li>Minute tears or ruptures of individual muscle tissue increase the likelihood of
    structural changes in muscle fibers with a resulting enzyme efflux that causes delayed
    soreness. </li>
  <li>An accumulation of metabolites in the muscle resulting from prolonged exercise after a
    latent period. The edema caused by increased osmotic pressure excites sensory nerve
    endings, thereby causing pain. </li>
  <li>Overstretching and possible tearing of the muscle's connective tissue harness. A
    significant increase in hydroxproline levels hours after exercise suggests that connective
    tissue damage in and around the muscle or an imbalance of collagen metabolism (a
    degradation process) is somehow involved in exercise-induced muscle soreness. </li>
  <li>A diminished muscular oxygen supply due to inadequate blood flow in the active muscles
    can leave the undernourished fibers vulnerable to injury. This ischemia can produce pain
    and initiate a reflex contraction in the muscle. This situation in turn prolongs the
    ischemia and sets up repeated cycles of pain, ischemia and spasm. </li>
</ul>

<p>Although the precise cause of muscle soreness is unknown, there is an indisputable
relationship between use of SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® before and after a workout and the
avoidance of muscular pain and soreness.</p>

<p><font SIZE="4" COLOR="RED">MUSCLE INJURY AND TREATMENT</font><br>
Muscle injury and resulting pain can occur from playing a vigorous sport or even
overtaxing muscles not normally used, such as in painting a ceiling or carrying a heavy
suitcase.</p>

<p>SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® used as a treatment for overuse injuries helps eliminate
obstructions and improve microcirculation in the muscles, facilitating recovery of cell
metabolism. The pain is thereby relieved as the injury begins to heal. SWEDISH SPORTS
RUB® can also benefit the following conditions: 

<ul>
  <li>Pain and Inflammation of Arthritis and Joints </li>
  <li>Neuralgia </li>
  <li>Chronic Muscle Spasms </li>
  <li>Back Pains </li>
  <li>Tendinitis </li>
  <li>Torn Ligaments </li>
  <li>Sprains and Strains </li>
</ul>

<p>SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® FULFILLS ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Effective Analgesic Action </li>
  <li>Rapid Resorption of Edema and Hematomas </li>
  <li>Improvement of Microcirculation to Enhance the Natural Healing Process </li>
</ul>

<p>SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® is an excellent therapeutic modality in treating the following
injuries and disorders: 

<ul>
  <li>Soft Tissue Injuries </li>
  <li>Fibromyalgia </li>
  <li>Myofascial Spasm </li>
  <li>Bursitis </li>
  <li>Neck and Shoulder Pain </li>
  <li>Cumulative Trauma Disorders </li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE="4" COLOR="RED">PREVENTION</font><br>
It has often been said that the best treatment of exertion injuries is prevention. SWEDISH
SPORTS RUB® makes prevention possible by eliminating and avoiding certain predisposing
factors. When applied before a workout, it increases blood flow in the muscles and joints.
SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® increases the muscles' elasticity and helps prevent injury. Regular
usage not only improves muscles' ability to perform, but also improves the body's
tolerance to physical stressors.</p>

<p><font SIZE="4" COLOR="RED">ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS</font><br>
During work or exercise muscle incurs damage and nutrient depletion. Following exercise or
work the muscle undergoes a period of recovery. This recovery period provides for the
renewal of expanded nutrient resources and for the repair of tissue damage. Some fibers
will have their recovery process impeded. This impediment to isolated fiber recovery has
been recognized as a biomechanical pressure barrier which blocks the productive blood flow
to the fibers in question. When the blood flow to select fibers are biomedically impeded,
then adequate nutrition needed for repair and renewal is severely delayed. Remember,
recovery is &quot;flow dependent.&quot; If you have adequate blood flow following heavy
bouts of work or exercise, then recovery is sure to follow. Restricted blood flow hampers
recovery. Therefore, a nutrient dense blood flow will enhance recovery and in doing so,
will aid in the prevention of future injury.</p>

<p align="center">SWEDISH SPORTS RUB® is an excellent adjunct for relaxing muscle tension
and spasm. By dilating blood vessels and endomysal capillary beds, this increases blood
flow which nourishes muscle fibers. </p>
