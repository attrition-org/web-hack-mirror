<p>ok, so its black history month.
<br>but these websites really piss me off.
<br>Why do you have to be so fucking hypocritical!?<br>
<BR>
<br>Calling white people racists, yet your company tends to only <b>one
type of person</b>
<br>&nbsp;yeah well <b>fuck you</b>
<br>Black experience? Black history month? WTF?<br>
<BR>
<br>Where is white people's months?
<br>Is it because we were in power that suddenly we get shit on?
<br>Sure I disagree with slavery, and violence as a result of racism, but
cmon people.
<br>this is just being hypocritical.
<p>But i remember a time my friend got jumped by a black man, and no one
believed him because he was nazi
<br>(not a violent one, someone who believed in the ideals). He was
seriously
injured and couldn't talk for a week, and no justice for him
<p>fuck you people.<font size=+1></font>
