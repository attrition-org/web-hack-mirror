<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Defined as:<EM>"political theory opposed to all forms of government. Anarchists believe that
the highest attainment of humanity is the freedom of the individual to express himself,
unhindered by any form of repression or control from without. The belief that all
governments rest on violence to control their subjects" </EM></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The illusion of democracy. There is always an majority and minority. So does democracy
represent liberty? I don't think so, there are always people(the minority) who is the victim of the
minority.  </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Is anarchy the solution?yes, in a certain way it is, but it can only work when everbody is an
anarchist...now our goal is to convince that anarchy is much, much better dan democracy.</P>
