<br>
securenet is a site about security.
<br>
but it is owned...
<br>
<br>
why is this site called *securenet*?
<br>
i think cause to "brazilian hackers" it is impossible.
<br>
of course... they doesn't have skill.
<br>
<br>
dudes, do u know what "skill" means?
<br>
<br>
skill isn't defacing a windoze boxen running IIS 4.0/5.0 or gnu/linux running wu 2.6.0(1), bind 8.2/8.2.1 or rpc statd. skill isn't using code from
other people. skill isn't running a subnet scanner.
<br>
<br>
so, "brazilian hackers" don't have skill
<br>
<br>
<br>
well, what do u think about securenet owned?
<br>
heh. some people thinked this isn't possible, but we're here to show to you.
