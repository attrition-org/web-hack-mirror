<p><u><strong>Death Stalks A Continent </strong></u>(reproduced from time magazine without
permisson)</span></p>

<p>You get up in the morning and breakfast with your three kids. One is already doomed to
die in infancy. Your husband works 200 miles away, comes home twice a year and sleeps
around in between. You risk your life in every act of sexual intercourse. You go to work
past a house where a teenager lives alone tending young siblings without any source of
income. At another house, the wife was branded a whore when she asked her husband to use a
condom, beaten silly and thrown into the streets. Over there lies a man desperately sick
without access to a doctor or clinic or medicine or food or blankets or even a kind word.
At work you eat with colleagues, and every third one is already fatally ill. You whisper
about a friend who admitted she had the plague and whose neighbors stoned her to death.
Your leisure is occupied by the funerals you attend every Saturday. You go to bed fearing
adults your age will not live into their 40s. You and your neighbors and your political
and popular leaders act as if nothing is happening. </p>

<p>Across the southern quadrant of Africa, this nightmare is real. The word not spoken is
AIDS, and here at ground zero of humanity's deadliest cataclysm, the ultimate tragedy is
that so many people don't know--or don't want to know--what is happening.</p>

<p>As the HIV virus sweeps mercilessly through these lands--the fiercest trial Africa has
yet endured--a few try to address the terrible depredation. The rest of society looks
away. Flesh and muscle melt from the bones of the sick in packed hospital wards and lonely
bush kraals. Corpses stack up in morgues until those on top crush the identity from the
faces underneath. Raw earth mounds scar the landscape, grave after grave without name or
number. Bereft children grieve for parents lost in their prime, for siblings scattered to
the winds. </p>

<p>ill spare you the rest , (6 pages).&nbsp; </p>

<p>hunger has a cure.&nbsp; food.</p>

<p>poverty has a cure, finance</p>

<p>lonliness has a cure, love</p>

<p>put a homeless man in a house, and you cure torment.</p>

<p>mutating virii arent impressed by our material novelty, therefore it just kills us.</p>
