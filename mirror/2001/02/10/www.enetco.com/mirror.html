--Dr. Crash1 <br>
<br>
It is worth remembering that, although we do not cause damage<br>
to the systems we hack, what we do is still illegal. Our main<br>
aim is to satisfy our desire to hack and this co-exists with<br>
our aim of helping the system administrator secure his system<br>
against possible future attacks by the sort cyber-vandals who<br>
have managed to give hackers a bad name, by crashing systems,<br>
violating people's privacy and generally causing trouble. The<br>
closest we come to this sort of thing is when the machine we<br>
hack is a web server, in which case, we will often leave our<br>
&quot;calling card&quot; - a small image of an ace of spades - at the<br>
bottom of the page, linked to a hidden page with information<br>
about AoHP. One of our primary aims is to dispel the myth<br>
perpetuated by the media that all hackers are bad. Our name<br>
comes from an interview given by John Austen, then the<br>
Detective Inspector in charge of Scotland Yard's Computer<br>
Crime Unit, who expressed fears that &quot;Gullible young hackers<br>
could be taken advantage of by agents of a hostile power.&quot;<br>
One of our aims is to influence gullible young hackers who<br>
might otherwise fall into the trap of hacking into some<br>
serious site using some script they've downloaded from the<br>
Net that exploits some bug that allows them root access,<br>
boasting about it online or to their friends and getting<br>
busted by the FBI and touted as a major threat to national<br>
security.<br>
<br>
We feel that we define ethical hacking and we would like to<br>
think that a system administrator, when asked &quot;If you were<br>
going to be hacked - didn't have a choice in the matter -<br>
who would you prefer to be hacked by?&quot;, would reply &quot;The<br>
Agents of a Hostile Power.&quot;<br>
<br>
More and more, we are seeing hackers being captured and<br>
claiming that they did not intend to cause harm to the<br>
systems they had hacked and that they were only doing it<br>
for the challenge and so on. To these people, we would say<br>
this: If this is true, then adopt our policies of not<br>
altering the system by installing backdoors and of only<br>
using true hacking techniques - ie. avoiding password<br>
sniffers. Most importantly, alert the system administrator<br>
to the fact that his systems security is flawed, and let<br>
him know what steps he needs to take to fix this. Only<br>
then can you claim that your intentions were honourable or<br>
ethical as opposed to malicious.<br>
<br>
We know that what we do is illegal and, if any of us were<br>
to be captured, we would accept this fact, admit that we<br>
knew what we were doing was wrong, and face the music. For<br>
us, hacking is an intellectual challenge, not something to<br>
boast about to our peers (particularly as none of us are<br>
teenagers).Hacking isn't about impressing our friends. We<br>
don't want fame. We're ethical hackers and although it may<br>
sound corny, we have our honour and our code.<br>
<br>
That's all we need.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font color="#808080">Are You a Hacker?</font><br>
  <font color="#808080"><br>
  Take a little quiz for me today. Tell me if you fit this<br>
  description. You got your net account several months ago. You have been <br>
  surfing the net, and you laugh at those media reports of the information <br>
  superhighway. You have a red box, you don't have to pay for phone calls.<br>
  You have crackerjack, and you have run it on the password file at a unix<br>
  you got an account on. Everyone at your school is impressed by your computer<br>
  knowledge, you are the one the teachers ask for help. Does this sound <br>
  like you? <strong>You are not a hacker</strong>.<br>
  There are thousands of you out there. You buy 2600 and you <br>
  ask questions. You read phrack and you ask questions. You join<br>
  #hack and you ask questions. You ask all of these questions, and you<br>
  ask what is wrong with that? After all, to be a hacker is to question<br>
  things, is it not? But, you do not want knowledge. You want answers. <br>
  You do not want to learn how things work. You want answers. You do not<br>
  want to explore. All you want to know is the answer to your damn<br>
  questions. You are not a hacker. <br>
  Hacking is not about answers. Hacking is about the path you<br>
  take to find the answers. If you want help, don't ask for answers,<br>
  ask for a pointer to the path you need to take to find out those answers<br>
  for yourself. Because it is not the people with the answers that are<br>
  the hackers, it is the people that are travelling along the path.<br>
