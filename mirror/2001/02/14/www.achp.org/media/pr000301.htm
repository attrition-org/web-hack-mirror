      <P>San Francisco -- Daniel B. Wolfson, President and CEO of the Alliance 
        of Community Health Plans, has been selected to join fifty health care, 
        business and community leaders leHHto participate in the Health Forum's 
        award-winning Creating Healthier Communities Fellowship program. </P>

      <P>Selected through a competitive application process, the new class of Fellows 
        represents 19 states plus Canada, and come from a cross-section of community 
        life including health care executives, business and educational professionals, 
        government leaders and public health officials. Additionally, the new 
        class includes three community teams, representing unique partnerships 
        between health systems and local organizations committed to improving 
        the health and well-being of their communities. </P>

      <P>"The Fellowship has given me a rich opportunity to learn from some of the brightest 
        people in the country engaged in efforts to improve the health of their 
        communities," said 1999 -2000 Fellow Douglas J. Leonard, president and 
        CEO, Columbus Regional Hospital in Columbus, Ind. "I've forged relationships 
        that will last a long time after the fellowship." </P>

      <P>The Creating Healthier Communities Fellowship, now in its eighth year, provides 
        leadership development opportunities through a powerful combination of 
        leading-edge faculty, specially designed curriculum and field-based projects. 
        The Fellowship program combines face-to-face leadership retreats, self-study 
        educational curriculum, on-line computer conferencing and site visits. 
      </P>

      <P>The heart of the Fellowship program is an individualized Action Learning 
        Project that is implemented by each Fellow in his or her own community. 
        These projects are collaborative, problem-solving efforts focused on improving 
        health and quality of life in a community. </P>
      <P>Among the planned Action Learning Projects planned are: a project to 
        develop community wellness programs based on traditional Navajo philosophy 
        for the Navajo Nation Division of Health in Shiprock, N.M.; a school-based, 
        multi-focused project incorporating an interactive CD-ROM assessment survey 
        that will create programs to promote healthy teens in New Jersey; a project 
        focusing on the utilization of health care partnerships to advance the 
        leadership competencies necessary to create healthy communities in British 
        Columbia, Canada; a program where senior medical school students provide 
        free physical exams and health education to indigent women and children 
        at their homes in Houston; and, the creation of a center where programs 
        for older adults will support them in reviewing and affirming the successes 
        of their lives, and passing those legacies on to future generations. </P>
      <P>"Improving the health and quality of their communities comes first with 
        this year's Fellows," said Kathryn E. Johnson, president and CEO of Health 
        Forum. "We applaud their commitment to making their vision of a healthy 
        community become a reality." </P>
      <P>Health Forum was created through the union of The Healthcare Forum and 
        the American Hospital Association's publishing and data and information 
        subsidiaries. Health Forum offers health care leaders access to new information 
        and fresh ideas which they can use to strengthen their organization's 
        clinical and business performance. Its Web site is <a href="http://www.healthforum.com">www.healthforum.com</a>
