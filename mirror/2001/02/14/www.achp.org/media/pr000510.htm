      <P> More than 30 organizations representing consumers, union workers, health 
        care providers and employers, announced on May 10<sup>th</sup> the findings 
        of a study of 1.4 million continuously insured people, their use of prescription 
        drugs and the resulting costs over the last three years. </P>
      <p>According to the Rx Health Value study, annualized cost increases for 
        the population surveyed were 28.8% (24.4% when adjusted for study group's 
        aging) for each of the three years studied (1996-1999), a higher rate 
        of increase than reported by any previous study. Dan Wolfson, ACHP's president 
        and CEO told reporters a news conference at the National Press Club in 
        Washington that the results of this unprecedented study show that, "…there 
        is a compelling need for independent data regarding the comparative value 
        of prescription drugs."</p>
      <p>RxHealthValue members asked the Schneider Institute for Health Policy 
        at Brandeis University to undertake the study using the extensive data 
        base of PCS Health Systems, a national pharmacy benefit management organization 
        and a Center member. The study will be described Thursday at the annual 
        meeting of the Council on the Economic Impact of Health System Change 
        at Princeton University in New Jersey. Stanley Wallack, Ph.D., Executive 
        Director of the Schneider Institute and principal investigator for the 
        study, said "This is the first research that documents the <u>actual use</u> 
        of prescription drugs by an insured population over time and allows us 
        to identify some never reported trends. These findings are significant 
        in that we now know that price isn't the <u>single factor</u> driving 
        escalating prescription drug expenditures. Americans are <u>using more 
        prescriptions</u>, at <u>younger ages</u> and <u>for more conditions</u> 
        and are <u>substituting newer, more costly medications for more established 
        products</u>. This increase in cost per treatment day, coupled with the 
        price and the substitution effect in a stable population of insured individuals 
        has been the major contributor to the 28.8% annual increase during this 
        period." </p>
      <p>The Brandeis researchers determined that the increase in the number of 
        people taking prescription drugs has been greatest among the 45-65 year-olds. 
        The growth in prescriptions per person has been greatest for the 65 and 
        older age group. New medications account for more than one third of the 
        increase in total expenditures during this period. Additionally, focusing 
        on three specific drug classes - Proton Pump Inhibitors (GI agents); Cox-2 
        and NSAIDs (anti-arthritics) and Statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs), 
        they found patients not only substituting new drugs for old ones, but 
        also beginning drug therapy for conditions not previously treated with 
        prescription medications.</p>
      <p>With this increase in use and costs of prescription drugs, little objective 
        comparative information is available. "Consumers, clinicians, payers and 
        policy makers are at a distinct disadvantage," said John Golenski, Acting 
        Executive Director of RxHealthValue. "Determining <u>value</u> has been 
        almost impossible in the absence of an independent source of data and 
        analysis." Golenski said RxHealthValue has been created to provide that 
        kind of information. Since RxHealthValue's primary mission is the creation 
        and dissemination of useful information for making value-based judgments, 
        the Center's members made three initial recommendations: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishment of independent research institutes to determine the 
          clinical and economic value of prescription drugs; </li>
        <li>Development of national standards for risk/benefit information disclosure 
          in direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medications; and, 
        </li>
        <li>Improved post-marketing monitoring of adverse drug reactions, especially 
          of "fast track" drugs, by the FDA.</li>
      </ul>
      
          <p>&#9;During the next several months, RxHealthValue will be sponsoring 
            additional research on prescription drug value and releasing additional 
            recommendations to enhance and support value-based decisions<b>.</b></p>
