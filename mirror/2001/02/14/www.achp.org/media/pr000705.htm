        Foundation Targets </b></i><b><i>Tobacco Use Prevention and Reduction</i></b></font></p>
      <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Washington, D.C. (July 5, 
        2000)</span> –  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) has awarded 
        a $475,000, three-year grant to support the Alliance of Community Health 
        Plans’ (ACHP) long-term commitment to making tobacco prevention a primary 
        care priority for the managed care industry.</p>
      <p>“With this extensive Robert Wood Johnson Foundation support, ACHP will 
        expand successful tobacco prevention and cessation efforts from group 
        practice settings into the clinical offices of individual physician practices,” 
        noted Daniel Wolfson, the Alliance’s president and CEO.  “This is important 
        because managed care has evolved from group health plans to mixed and 
        network models,” he explained.  </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><span> </span>It is anticipated that 10 to 12 health 
        plans, representing as many as 8 million enrolled members, will participate 
        in these tobacco improvement efforts.  Under the grant, there will also 
        be leadership training that will enable participating plans to ultimately 
        serve as tobacco reduction resources for the rest of the managed care 
        industry.  </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Hundreds of thousands of people die each year from diseases 
        attributable to tobacco use.   ACHP chose to target tobacco interventions 
        to better address secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. This 
        project builds on coronary disease reduction efforts spearheaded by the 
        Alliance in its pioneering Benchmarks in Quality and Safety initiative 
        announced earlier this year.  For patients with established heart disease, 
        tobacco cessation is an essential primary and secondary prevention measure. 
      </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Established in 1984, ACHP supports its member plans' 
        ongoing efforts to improve the health of their members and the communities 
        they serve.  ACHP’s membership  includes 22 leading non-investor owned 
        and provider-based health plans serving more than 8 million Americans 
        in 23 states and the District of Columbia.  These plans work with approximately 
        100,000 physicians in thousands of local communities.   ACHP is a founding 
        member of The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.</p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText2>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, based in Princeton, 
        NJ, is the nation's largest philanthropy devoted exclusively to health 
        and health care. It concentrates its grant making in three goal areas: 
        to assure that all Americans have access to basic health care at reasonable 
        cost; to improve care and support for people with chronic health conditions; 
        and,  to reduce the personal, social and economic harm caused by substance 
        abuse -- tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs.</p>
