            <p><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2">The Benchmarks in Quality 
              & Safety (BIQS) initiative advances a population-based framework 
              for health plans to facilitate the work of provider partners to 
              improve the health of individuals and communities. The program sets 
              an expectation that health plans will pursue broad improvement goals 
              in specific areas responsible for poor health in a significant segment 
              of the community (e.g., heart disease or diabetes). The selected 
              goals must require comprehensive improvement of health services 
              and interventions as well as attack underlying reasons for poor 
              health in the community at large. It also advances a recognition 
              program of benchmark performance based on this framework through 
              establishing criteria related to structural components in place 
              and process and outcome measures to improve the health of a targeted 
              population. </font></p>
            <p><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2">The Alliance will provide 
              a framework for high performing health plans, share information 
              on best practices, and guide plans in need of assistance to the 
              best available sources of quality improvement technology. Alliance 
              health plans will document and freely share the identified best 
              practices in the key health area of accountability. The framework 
              is patient-focused and deals with methods health plans use to add 
              value. BIQS offers answers to these questions: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2"> How does the health 
                plan participate in improving the health of the population covered 
                and served and the health of the community? In doing so, how does 
                this targeted improvement of health go beyond physicians to reach 
                other key stakeholders like hospitals and community providers?</font></li>
              <li><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2"> How does the plan facilitate 
                the work of providers and the processes of care while enhancing 
                quality and reducing waste in the system?</font></li>
              <li><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2"> How does the plan support 
                enrolled members in managing their own health and in making informed 
                decisions about their health care? How does the plan provide information 
                to members, prospective members and the community on the quality 
                of care and service? </font></li>
              <li><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2"> How does the health 
                plan make itself accountable to its communities and purchasers 
                in achieving its long and short- term health goals and process

            <p><font face="verdana,helvetica" size="2"> Advancing a new paradigm 
              beyond process improvement, this framework has two unique features. 
              The first is its focus on the achievement of health outcome goals. 
              An example is the reduction of heart events -- deaths, admissions 
              and procedures among the enrolled population with coronary heart 
              disease (CHD). To achieve such a goal might require improvements 
              in multiple areas such as secondary prevention of CHD, smoking interventions 
              and enhanced management of congestive heart failure. The other unique 
              framework feature is the expectation of community involvement to 
              address behavioral norms or systematic health care issues in the 
              community. The measurement system and designation are being advanced 
              as a model and test run for a new method of accountability that 
              would be further advanced by independent accreditation agencies.

              of Community Health Plans (ACHP), the foremost national association 
              of not-for-profit and provider based plans, is working to improve 
              America's health care. In the belief that the need to improve health 
              care quality has become urgent, ACHP (formerly The HMO Group) has 
              embarked on a new and strategic campaign to define and distinguish 
              the characteristics of the trustworthy health plans that make up 
              our membership. We are determined to heighten the awareness of legislators, 
              regulators, the media and other opinion leaders about the values 
              and the value added programs that our health plans and others can 
              and do bring to the evolution of the new health care paradigm. The 
              strong public policy voice that the industry seeks can be attained 
              and sustained only through genuine accomplishments in pursuit of 
              a mission all members share. To this end we will work together to 
              identify performance expectations and areas of accountability which 
              will become the clearly recognized "signature" of health plan membership 
              in ACHP. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The

              have in adding value in the processes of delivering and financing 
              health care. The results we will demand of ourselves can only be 
              achieved in well organized and adequately integrated systems in 
              which high quality providers are identified, supported by the plans 
              in their work and with rewards directed toward improved health outcomes.

                does the health plan participate in improving the health of the 
                population covered and served and the health of the community? 
                In doing so, how does this targeted improvement of health go beyond 
                physicians to reach other key stakeholders like hospitals and 
                community providers?</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
                How does the plan facilitate the work of providers and the processes 
                of care while enhancing quality and reducing waste in the system? 
                </font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">How 
                does the plan support enrolled members in managing their own health 
                and in making informed decisions about their health care? How 
                does the plan provide information to members, prospective members

                and process goals? </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These 
              questions are seen in a context of specified health and health care 
              improvement goals in areas such as heart disease, behavioral health, 
              diabetes, women's health, child development, cancer and injuries. 
              The defined populations affected may be high utilizers of medical 
              care while other initiatives will address larger population segments 
              at high risk for illness or injury. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Advancing 
              a new paradigm beyond process improvement, unique features of this 
              framework include its focus on the achievement of health outcome 
              goals. An example might be the reduction of heart events -- deaths, 
              admissions and procedures among the enrolled population with coronary 
              heart disease (CHD). To achieve such a goal might require improvements 
              in multiple areas such as secondary prevention of CHD, smoking interventions 
              and enhanced management of congestive heart failure. The other unique 
              feature of the framework is the expectation of community involvement 
              to address behavioral norms or systematic health care issues in 
              the community. Health plans would be expected to make a contribution 
              in improving the health of the community, which would have indirect 
              benefits to the health of its enrolled population. Lastly, the measurement 
              system and designation are being advanced as a model and test run 
              for a new method of accountability that would be further advanced 
              by independent accreditation agencies. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whether 
              a health plan obtains benchmark performance in a particular health 
              area will be determined by establishing the presence of structural 
              components and process and outcome measures. Standardized measures 
              from HEDIS will be used for comparative purposes and other health 
              plan generated measures will be examined to note the level of measurement 
              underway at a health plan and the improvement of processes and outcomes 
              over time. As more outcome measures become standardized through 
              HEDIS, more emphasis will be placed on outcome measures and more 
              comparative analysis can be done, assuming there are also risk adjusters 
              available. Initially there will be more reliance on identification 
              of structural components than might be desired. Ultimately, this 
              benchmark performance should be primarily driven by outcome measures. 
              It is envisioned that health plans that meet the criteria would 
              receive some sort of designation like a "merit badge" in a health 
              area. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
              first step in this process will be to establish standards and then 
              develop criteria regarding what it means to be in compliance with 
              a particular standard. It is hoped that this Alliance will work 
              with an organization like NCQA in institutionalizing these merit 
              badges. To enhance the credibility of this designation, NCQA and 
              ACHP would work with interested organizations, depending on the 
              topic, such as American College of Physicians, American Heart Association, 
              American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association, Washington 
              Business Group on Health and the Employer's Managed Health Care 
              Association, in establishing standards and criteria. These organizations 
              would be joint sponsors of the merit designation. By becoming involved 
              early in this pilot process, both the Alliance and its member plans 
              will be recognized as pioneers of this designation and retain the 
              designation as a signature of the Alliance.</font></p>

              Quality Infrastructure Prerequisites</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Health 
              plans that meet ACHP's BIQS Eligibility Criterion, "Quality Infrastructure 
              Prerequisites", may apply for BIQS Merit Designation. The Eligibility 
              Criterion is described in the Surveyor Guidelines. While the BIQS 
              Eligibility Criterion encompass areas addressed by NCQA standards 
              (quality management and improvement and preventive health services 
              in particular), the actual BIQS Criteria go beyond NCQA standards 
              in the area being examined. Receipt of a BIQS Merit Designation 
              indicates that a health plan has met the Quality Infrastructure 
              Prerequisites and then gone beyond these standards in the subject 
              area. Differences between BIQS and NCQA accreditation of a health 
              plan (which also requires efforts and examines specific areas of 
              health improvement) include broad population-based goal setting 
              requiring comprehensive interventions, community partnerships and 
              participation in efforts to improve the health of the community.

              Engagement in Population-based Health Improvement and Health Outcomes</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This 
              model of population health improvement is largely based on the work 
              of HealthPartners and presented in an article by Nico Pronk and 
              Patrick O'Connor, MD, "Systems Approach to Population Health Improvement" 
              (J Ambulatory Care Management, 1997). The goal is to improve the 
              health of a targeted population. Elements of this model include: 
              </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1) 
              to set specific, appropriate and measurable population health improvement 
              goals; 2) to assess the health risks and health status of the identified 
              population (this directs the program planning and establishes a 
              baseline and aids in the identification of members who would most 
              benefit from specific interventions); 3) to assess the willingness 
              of the members to participate and eliminate barriers; and 4) to 
              have each individual assess his/her readiness to change behavior. 
              Based on goals, willingness of members to participate, the health 
              status of the population, and readiness to change, appropriate programs 
              can be developed, implemented and then evaluated. Pronk and O'Connor 
              go on to discuss what is required to sustain this effort, which 
              includes the need for substantial resources, measuring process and 
              outcomes measures and developing long-term relationships with stakeholders. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
              area can be expanded to include a wide continuum of care and focus 
              on improving outcomes of care. The Foundation for Accountability 
              (FACCT) has developed a similar framework for outcome measurement. 
              It includes finding measures in areas referred to as: Staying Healthy 
              (preventive and wellness services), Living with Illness (functional 
              status, disease management) and Changing Needs (long-term care). 
              The active participation of a delivery system in measuring outcomes 
              along this spectrum for a particular health area is the sign of 
              a comprehensive and effective system of care. Measures to track 
              include: clinical process measures, patient satisfaction and in 
              the long-run, functional status such as disability days. </font></p>

              Systematic Effort to Improve the Process of Care and Service</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Within 
              each selected area of concern, organized systems of care must be 
              held accountable for efforts to improve the processes of medical 
              diagnosis and treatment in acute, chronic and end of life phases 
              of care. This is done to improve the satisfaction of the patient 
              with the experience, improve the medical outcome and reduce waste 
              in the system. The more lean the production, the more standardized 
              the process and the more systems-thinking involved in planning the 
              process, the better the expected outcome. This systems thinking 
              involves an examination of the work process, identification of the 
              root causes of a problem and a redesign of the process which might 
              involve information system solutions (i.e., reengineering). To meet 
              aggressive health goals in specified areas requires making changes 
              in multiple places along the continuum of care (preventive, acute 
              and chronic care) and determining high leverage points to maximize 
              a system's return on investment. In addition to improving existing 
              processes of care, the system looks to develop entirely new systems 
              of care and intervention to achieve its goals. Scientific evidence 
              from the literature and collecting best practices experiences are 
              used in designing new approaches to health care. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
              essential skills and proper orientation to manage care on a population 
              basis go beyond interventions targeted to change behavior in specific 
              clinical areas. Improved performance of physicians requires the 
              collaborative development of specific care management skills in 
              such areas as case management, case reviews, clinical guidelines, 
              data review and quality management. Physician education is a key 
              component in achieving change on the front lines of the delivery 
              system; the trustworthy health plan facilitates these developments.

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Increasingly, 
              individuals are learning to seek physicians and other providers 
              who match preferences and perceived needs. Such patient preferences 
              for physicians may be based on age, gender, medical history, previous 
              experience with physicians or many other factors. We recognize the 
              special dynamics of choosing a physician within an HMO system and 
              the additional decision support appropriate to the system's unique 
              features. Information can allay anxiety. With this in mind, information 
              about physicians' education, graduate training, areas of expertise, 
              accessibility and availability and meaningful quality measures should 
              be provided. This should be a basic feature of any trustworthy and 
              accountable health plan.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Patients 
              should be supported and encouraged to seek health care information 
              and have active roles in the development of personal care plans. 
              There is an important role for accountable health plans in the facilitation 
              of shared decision making. The mass of information and information 
              technology available is nearly overwhelming to individual providers 
              anxious to support their patients in increasing their autonomy. 
              Plans should be expected to support providers in this role. Of equal 
              or greater importance is the opportunity to develop a new pathway 
              for intervention strategies targeted to involve patients in patient-initiated 
              behavioral change. </font></p>
