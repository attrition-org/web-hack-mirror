As a friend of mine once said, Linus speaks to me via /dev/urandom</h1></center>

<center>And what he told me last night, was :
<br>"Kids must not learn the ways of linux, but the ways of war"<br>
<BR>
<br>So being the tech-savvy linux user&amp;&amp;abuser I am, I followed
Linus's wishes.
<br>Should I be punished?
<br>I would disagree.
<p>The html left on this page has about the same look as a first-timer-angelfire
page.
<br>so we did you a favour.
<p>"we" being the one and only:<br>

<center>(hi mom)
<p>kids, when you visit this website, go up to your mom and ask her
<br>"mommy what is hackweiser"
<br>and she shall reply:<br>
<BR>
<br>"they are the men who slept with me last week"
