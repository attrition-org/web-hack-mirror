<h4>
hi.</h4></center>

<center>I hate capitalism.
<br>I hate corporations.
<br>"then why deface momandpop.com" you say.
<p>welp.
<br>what makes up the internet?
<br>1% ebay, 1% etrade etc etc.
<br>or 80% momandpop's.com
<p>we must get our message across to the small companies, for the bigger
ones will not listen.
<br>I wouldn't be surprised if no one listened, for we live in a society
where the government tells lies, and people listen to them.
<br>well.
<br>fuck the government.
<br>And when i say that, i don't mean the fbi.
<br>I have come to the conclusion, they are just doing their job.
<br>But the corporations that leave <b>innocent</b> people thinking they
are secure
<br>"buy online, we are secure!"
<br>they preach, but they lie.
<br>You are not secure, security is an illusion.
<br>Of course, people don't matter to companies. It's all about money.
<br>well <b>fuck you</b>
<br>get that?
<br>I'm sick of your shit, the more money I make you spend on your server
then GOOD, im happy.
<br>Does that make me a malicious little fuck who deserves the firing
squad?
<br>Maybe, but at least I preach my thoughts.
<br>and People don't listen until you tread on their territory, then they
have no choice..</center>
