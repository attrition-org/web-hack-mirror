    running throughout the year, save those who are enjoying our customer support now. &nbsp;
    When things are working smoothly there is no problem. If something goes wrong then the
    irritation creeps in. The hardware engineer says it is a software problem, the software
    man in turn blames the modem , the modem supplier blames it on the hardware supplier again
    and you end up into calling and co-ordinating with so many agencies. The internet is a
    very , very rapidly changing technology. Newer and powerful browsers are introduced every
    few months, the mail software are evolving rapidly with newer and newer customer friendly
    features. Some of you have special needs for other software&#146;s such as Chat, Real
    Audio , Video players etc. etc. Some of you download some free software from the Net and
    end up in destabilising the system or end up with few unfriendly viruses on the system.
