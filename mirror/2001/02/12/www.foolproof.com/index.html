sitting<BR>in front of the glowing command line. Aaahhh... root.<BR>Such a 
sweet, yet forbidden fruit. Well, we got it from you, good.<BR>Well, this site 
*has* been hacked. No, it wasn't very hard at all.<BR>We aren't doing this to be 
l33t0 h4x0rz or anything like that, we just want<BR>to get the message across. 
No computer is secure. Anyone can be hacked. <BR>No matter how big your business 
or how technologically advanced your network, <BR>sooner or later, you'll be 
hacked. This is what happened here.<BR>Security is only as strong as it's 
weakest link, that's the hacker's job - <BR>to find that link and exploit it to 
gain further access.<BR>Normally you would have something to be afraid of, but 
not today. We come not to hurt your data, <BR>but to explore. We have found your 
site insecure and have brought that fact to your attention. <BR>In the future, 
you should think more about these things and maybe this won't happen again. 
<BR>We are just informing you of this weak security before someone <BR>with a 
malicious intent gets there first. <BR>... Now that this has been said, on to 
the other stuff ...</FONT></SMALL></B><BR><BR><BR><B><SMALL>Greets: Hackweiser,
