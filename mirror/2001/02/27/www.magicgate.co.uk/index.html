<P>What a friggin' joke, to all those who see this defacement I have to
say one thing: This certainly isn't using IIS, but enough with the IIS
defacements, they are giving me a bad
name, from now on, all you will see is *NIX defacements, and defacing is
by all means a VERY childish thing, I'm about to give it up all together.
<P>Anyways, you are not secure, find out your security problems and fix
them, I'm assuming you can at least do that. Do not worry, nothing was
deleted because I am not malicious. </CENTER>

<P><CENTER>I am by far not the best "hacker", but then again I am not the worst. I also do not feel like calling myself a "hacker" until I can successfully write <U>working</U> exploits, right now I have only a decent understanding of C. Above is a cool picture of my most hated OS, Windoze. Bill Gates: May you rott in hell. And I'm not just one of those little kiddies who follow the crowd and pretend not to like Micro$hit for no reason, I have my opinions, and other people have theirs.
<P>While I'm on the topic of Microsoft, however, I feel that everybody needs to hear about microsoft's bitching about Open Source and how it's gonna kill them. <B>DOES BILL GATES NOT ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY?</B> The article can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2158704,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2158704,00.html</A>
