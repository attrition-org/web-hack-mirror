<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Indian-Held Kashmir is rooted in the struggle of the people for the exercise of
the right of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-determination. Peaceful
processions chanting demands for freedom were fired upon by Indian Army and
Police. Hundreds of men, women and children have been killed or wounded.&nbsp;
New Delhi's allegations of assistance to the Kashmiri people from the Pakistan
side are unfounded.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Objective reports in
foreign media testify that the Kashmiri agitation is indigenous.&nbsp; Pakistan
upholds the right of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to self-determination in
accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. These
resolutions of 1948 and 1949 provide for the holding of a free and impartial
plebiscite for the determination of the future of the State by the people of
Jammu and Kashmir.&nbsp; The basic points about the UN resolutions are that :&nbsp;
(i) the complaint relating to Kashmir was initiated by India in the Security
Council ; (ii) the Council explicitly and by implication, rejected India's claim
that Kashmir is legally Indian territory; (iii) the resolutions established
self-determination as the governing principle for the settlement of the Kashmir
dispute. This is the world body's commitment to the people of Kashmir ; (iv) the
resolutions endorsed a binding agreement between India and Pakistan reached
through the mediation of UNCIP, that a plebiscite would be held, under agreed
and specified conditions.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The Security Council has
rejected the Indian contention that the people of Kashmir have exercised their
right of self-determination by participating in the &quot;elections&quot; which
India has from time to time organised in the Held Kashmir. The 0.2% turn out
during the 1989 &quot;elections&quot; was the most recent clear repudiation of
the Indian claim.&nbsp; Pakistan continues to adhere to the UN resolutions.
These are binding also on India.&nbsp; The Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, to
which Pakistan also continues to adhere, did not alter the status of Jammu and
Kashmir as a disputed territory:&nbsp; Para 6 of the Agreement lists &quot;a
final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir&quot; as one of the outstanding questions
awaiting a settlement.&nbsp; Para 4 (ii) talks of a &quot;Line of Control&quot;
as distinguished from an international border. Furthermore, it explicitly
protects &quot;the recognised position of either side,&quot; The recognised
position of Pakistan is the one which is recognised by the United Nations and
the World Community in general.&nbsp; Article I (iv) obviously refers to the
Kashmir issue when it talks of &quot;the basic issues and causes of conflict
which have bedevilled the relations between the two countries for the last 25
years.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The Simla Agreement does
not preclude raising of Kashmir issue at the United Nations:&nbsp; Para I (I)
specifically provides that the UN Charter &quot;shall govern&quot; relations
between the parties.&nbsp; Para I (ii) providing for settlement of differences
by peaceful means, does not exclude resort to the means of pacific settlement of
disputes and differences provided in the UN Charter.&nbsp; The UN Security
Council remains seized of the Kashmir issue which ermines onf the Council's
agenda.&nbsp; Articles 34 and 35 of the UN Charter specifically empower the
Security Council to investigate any dispute independently or at the request of a
member State. These provisions cannot be made subservient to any bilateral
agreement.&nbsp; According to Article 103 of the UN Charter, member States
obligations under the Charter take precedence over obligations under a bilateral
agreement.&nbsp; Presence of United Nations Military Observers Group in India
and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) at the Line of Control in Kashmir is a clear evidence off
UN's involvement in the Kashmir issue.&nbsp; Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed
territory.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">It dies not involve the
principle of respect for the unity and territorial integrity of states, to which
Pakistan adheres.&nbsp; Attempts to forcibley suppress the legitimate demands of
the people of Jammu and Kashmir are doomed to failure. Similarly, threats of use
of force will not affect Pakistan's resolve to maintain its position of
principle.&nbsp;</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Email
