<!-- Into the 21st Century -->

<b><font color="#336633" face="arial, helvetica">Into the 21st Century</font></b><br>

During the next millennium, the Rainforest Alliance will continue to promote dialogue between businesses, local communities and conservationists.  We will continue to seek practical solutions to the global problem of rapidly disappearing forests.<p>

While saving tropical flora and fauna makes good economic sense, we believe that we have a moral obligation to both future generations and the species themselves.  We are all part of the problem, but we can all be part of the solution.  More than a decade after we began, the Rainforest Alliance remains committed to removing everyone's hand from the chainsaw.<p>
