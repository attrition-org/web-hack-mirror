      <P><FONT face=Arial>It has 
      become an unfortunate aspect of the travel business this year that unprecedented&nbsp; increases in fuel prices have 
      caused air carriers to&nbsp;levy fuel surcharges. Jet fuel prices&nbsp;have risen 
      over 70% since last summer when charter air prices were 
      established.&nbsp; (You may also have&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;price increases at the gas pump as well.)&nbsp; 
      Due to this sharp increase in the price of jet fuel, all Charter 
      Airlines<STRONG> </STRONG> have the right to impose a fuel surcharge 
      upon the passenger to cover this increased operating expense.&nbsp; The 
      U.S. Department of Transportation regulates charter airlines and allows 
      these air carriers flexibility in imposing these fees, as contracts are 
      made many months in advance. Student Express, Inc.'s charter carriers 
      have&nbsp;levyed&nbsp;fuel surcharges. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial> Please be 
      advised that a surcharge of $40 per passenger is&nbsp;required for all 
      passengers traveling via air on Student Express spring break trips. Please call our reservations department at 
      1-800-787-3787 to make payment arrangements.&nbsp; Payments that are not 
      received prior to departure date will be collected at the airport just 
      prior to departure. Payments collected at the airport will include an additional $20 
      processing fee. We are sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause 
      you.</FONT></P>
