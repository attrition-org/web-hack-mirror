        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where is the international 
          framework of rights and justice? Is the UN dead, and its charter buried? 
          The people of Kashmir have long been promised the chance to decide their 
          destiny but now the UN is silent and the US says that &quot;East Timor 
          is not Kosovo __ nor is Kashmir another East Timor.'' This is in explanation 
          of why US interest in the Kashmir crisis is limited to forcing Pakistan 
          into submitting itself to the Indian hegemony and in Timor to &quot;humanitarian 
          concerns and strategically located sea-lanes.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; The US, however, is 
          mistaken. The reason the world has a problem with East Timor and Kashmir 
          is that they are other Kosovos but in different part of the world. Timor 
          did not begin that way, but that is what it has become. Whereas Kashmir 
          has actually begun that way. All the western governments have trouble 
          explaining why they cannot do anything effective about India's conduct 
          in Kashmir. Where are their incautious announcements about the arrival 
          of a new age of &quot;humanitarian wars'' for doing justice? Where are 
          their unguarded forecasts about the significance of NATO's victory over 
          Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo?&nbsp; President Bill Clinton announced 
          that beleaguered minorities everywhere in the world no longer had to 
          fear Kosovo-style ethnic cleansing. He said the &quot;international 
          community&quot; would protect them. Many argued that a new humanitarian 
          internationalism had been created, which in the future could stop and 
          punish ethnic cleansing, mass deportations, state terrorism and war 
          crimes. The age of sovereign nations would yield to an international 
          sovereignty. Clinton informed &quot;the people of the world'' that a 
          new era had dawned. &quot;Whether you live in Africa, or Central Europe, 
          or any other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians and tries 
          to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic background 
          or their religion, and it's within our power to stop it, we will stop 
          it,'' he said.&nbsp; The Kashmiris are experiencing a new kind of apathy 
          from the so-called international community which forces them to think 
          if they should forget about their rights in the new world order and 
          wait for deliverance from India's fascism till the day when their valley 
          would become as important to Eurocentric NATO as Kosovo. For a fair 
          deal, should they now depend on the compulsions of the states of India 
          and Pakistan, and the narrowly defined interests of the powerful international 
          community, rather than an international framework of rights and justice? 
          Given the historical baggage and hostilities, it is useless to expect 
          that Pakistan and India would sort it out between themselves.&nbsp; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is extremely surprising 
          that the leading powers are so willingly accepting India's weak position 
          on the issue in terms of international law. The fact is that Kosovo 
          is still recognised as a part of sovereign Yugoslavia whereas Kashmir 
          is a UN-recognised disputed territory awaiting a just and final settlement. 
          By exhorting Pakistan and India to treat an unjust and unresolved UN 
          cease-fire line as if it was as inviolable as divine revelation, and 
          approaching the precarious situation in Kargil as an isolated instance 
          of such unthinkable violation, the so-called international community 
          and the UN have only eroded their credibility. Surely, the present-day 
          upholders of human rights and values of justice and democracy should 
          be able to look beyond the line.&nbsp; The champions of human rights, 
          who were propelled into action because of ethnic cleansing of the Kosovars, 
          have chosen to disregard the even more serious repression in Kashmir. 
          They have chosen to disregard the ever-increasing number of Indian troops 
          that enforce Indian control through terror, torture, rape and murder. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US, its allies and the 
          UN are accomplices in Indian genocide for they are doing little more 
          than parroting the Indian refrain, and disregarding the unpardonable 
          crimes of India against innocent communities in the valley. It was everybody's 
          business when the Serb forces did these things in Kosovo on a much smaller 
          time and human loss scale. The Kashmir issue urgently requires a just 
          settlement that could only be brought about with the involvement of 
          the UN. Peace in Kashmir and hence the region could only be achieved 
          if the process starts with putting the people of Kashmir before any 
          strategic, commercial or political advantage of the powerful international 
          club or Pakistan or India. At the moment, it seems that the UN has no 
          power of its own. And this fact has had lethal consequences in Kashmir, 
          when combined with the UN's promise that its people could become independent 
          if they so chose. The Security Council thus far has declined to support 
          the promise made in its name.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nothing short of the credible 
          threat of a Kosovo-like military intervention, combined with international 
          economic and political reprisals against India, seems likely to end 
          the crisis. If we agree with the western propaganda, such as published 
          in the Washington Post, that &quot;no solution can be achieved under 
          the threat of military action,&quot; the question arises that what were 
          then the US and its allies trying to achieve through bombing Yugoslavia 
          for more than two months in a row?&nbsp; The Indian campaign to terrorise 
          supporters of independence and cleanse Kashmir of its Muslim population 
          approaches a successful conclusion. It has to be reversed. The Indian 
          defiance and mockery of the UN is intolerable and destabilising. The 
          UN has to act, as it is no more than what its members make of it, but 
          its existence and action are indispensable to a minimally civilised 
          international order. If its members expect any progress toward a new 
          and muscular humanitarianism, they must back the world organisation 
          against those who flagrantly defy it. A line has to be drawn, and in 
          Kashmir, the Indians themselves have drawn it.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
          the western press is encouraging UN's inaction by treating the Kashmir 
          crisis as an unimportant case than others around the world. According 
          to the Washington Post, for example, &quot;if the world powers, having 
          staked their prestige on self-determination for East Timor, can so easily 
          allow their will to be flouted, the 'security and strategic consequences' 
          will be immense, and they will resonate far beyond Indonesia,&quot; 
          but no such views are expressed about Kashmir where the situation is 
          more volatile than East Timor. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Post instead sides with 
          India and writes that it &quot;is rightly demanding that Pakistan help 
          in removing the guerrillas as the first step toward defusing the current 
          crisis&quot; and that &quot;India has so far shown commendable restraint.&quot;&nbsp; 
          With more than half a million soldiers in Kashmir, it is wrong to assume 
          that India is exercising restraint. However, the UN and US should accept 
          that Kashmir issue can never be settled in a cul-de-sac. It shall be 
          settled either through force or through international intervention and 
          pressure __ the possibility of the latter is apparently remote, although 
          efforts should continue in this direction. But nothing can be achieved 
          solely through bilateral negotiations, bypassing the people of Kashmir 
          and ignoring their wishes and sentiments. India would not be prepared, 
          it seems, for any kind of talks unless it is under real pressure from 
          the people and the freedom fighters.&nbsp; The British daily Financial 
          Times in its issue of May 28, 1999 writes under the heading &quot;War 
          in Kashmir&quot;: &quot;The nuclear dimension means the outside world 
          has much at stake too. India has always sought to avoid internationalisation 
          of the conflict but the world has a common interest in keeping it in 
          check. This is precisely the kind of problem for what the multilateral 
          approach of a strong UN is needed.&quot; And that needs approval from 
          Washington, which may not come until we face a nuclear holocaust on 
          the sub-continent.&nbsp; The Independent in its editorial of May 29, 
          1999, after mentioning the UN intervention in Kosovo and Iraq, its peace-keeping 
          efforts and the accountability of crimes against humanity, wrote: &quot;And 
          this is a doctrine that could be applied to the Kashmir conflict, which 
          was never a simple border dispute between the UN member states, or even 
          an argument about to which of them a province belonged.... The UN has 
          some standing in Kashmir, too, as the guarantor of the referendum once 
          promised by the Indian government......... In the case of Kashmir, however, 
          the UN is probably the only hope of peaceful resolution.&quot; This 
          is why the UN has to prove that it means to do more than just looking 
          after the interests of the powerful. It has to act alone on the issue 
          of Kashmir if not allowed by Washington.&nbsp; India has all along opposed 
          the deployment of UN peace force and the monitoring of LoC by UN representatives, 
          and this is a clear proof of India's mala fide. India's case on Kargil 
          is flimsy and full of contradictions. But here again Pakistan has failed 
          to bring round the world opinion. Woe to the self-appointed custodians 
          of international morality who are looking the other way at this premeditated 
          massacre as if the Kashmiri blood is less sacrosanct than the blood 
          of the Kosovars and inhabitants of East Timor. This callousness has 
          already convinced the bruised people in Kashmir that they are victim 
          of the UN, US and its allies' double standards of human rights and morality 
          and that the aphorism that 'might is right' is as relevant in the game 
          of power in the closing stages of the twentieth century as it was in 
          the Gothic ages.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The continuing crisis in 
          Kashmir is provoking calls for UN action. But with the UN unwilling 
          to intervene without the American and Indian permission there is little 
          leverage left to stop Indian occupation and oppression in the occupied 
          Kashmir. During the period of struggle, 70,000 hapless Kashmiri freedom 
          fighters have been gunned down and thousands are facing the same fate. 
          The sole crime of the victims is that they demanded their inalienable 
          right to self-determination to decide their future through a UN-supervised 
          plebiscite promised to them by the United Nations as well as by India 
          and Pakistan. But where is the UN?&nbsp; </font> </p>
