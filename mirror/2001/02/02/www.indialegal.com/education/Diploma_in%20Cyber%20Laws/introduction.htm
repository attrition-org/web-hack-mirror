      millennium has in a dynamic way brought technical revolution in India.
      Needless to add that digital technology has now crept in to every sphere
      of human activity, be it a simple contract or a highly skilled criminal
      activity. Thus the laws, which govern the existing matters of Contract,
      Patent, Trademarks and crime, are unable to cope with the technological
      invented problems. It has therefore, been necessary in every country and
      in India too to think in terms of modifying, amending or enacting new laws
      to deal with these legal problems. It is with this background that Indian
      Government too in its good faith has brought out a uniform comprehensive
      Act (Information Technology Act, 2000) to deal with such problems. This
      Act has been drafted too technically, which requires interpretation of
      techno-legal terms for proper understanding. Even to understand other
      legal developments in cyber laws (i.e. Domain disputes, trademarks,
      copyright etc.) basic knowledge of techno-legal terms is must both from
      practical and academic point of view.<o:p>
