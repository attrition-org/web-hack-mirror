<b>Admin:</b><br> Next time you decide to set up a mail server and host
various
sites, i suggest you pick i better OS than RedHat, i bet you're sitting in
your little swivel chair shitting yourself right now, well, don't
worry.. nothing was harmed, your old index.html is now index.html.bak if
you'd like to know anything about this hack, mail me at
<b>ap@firstlinux.net</b>
i suggest you learn something about security BEFORE you put this shit back
up.

I know this was a lame defacement, but if i didn't do it.. someone else
would.
