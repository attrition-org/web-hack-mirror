YOU'VE BEEN HACKED! You've been hacked by warlord1101 using your piece of shit Microsoft server. Next time why don't you consider switching to *NIX? Oh yeah, everything is there, nothing has been deleted because I am not malicious, I was just bored. You may want to take a look into this vulnerability of yours, as half the university is vulnerable to the same thing. Shoutz go out to: grimR, gideon[zs]. Abiotic_, Mr. K and Wickedsceptre, All those at my high school, and anybody else I missed. I ain't no IIS kiddie or anything, I just feel that your whole university should wake your fuckin' asses up. You'll find the index.html or whatever you had as an index page renamed to index2.html. Again I dedicate this defacement to all those at my school. And I think attrition and alldas for putting up with these lame-assed windows defacements.
