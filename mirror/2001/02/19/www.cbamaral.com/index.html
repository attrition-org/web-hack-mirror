<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>I was awakened by footsteps loudly
arriving outside my room, keys turned in the door, the door flung
open. -"Boss wants to see you" .</I></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>I followed the orderly silently up to the chief
quack's office.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"Ahh ! Come in Angelica.. ".</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>The room smelt of stale tobacco and that
aniseedy smell that you cannot recognize but you know it from a
doctor or dentists' waiting room.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Doctor Zimmerman smiled at me, his stained
teeth broke the brush of gray beard on his face. "Sit down
Angelica".</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"Now how have you been ?"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"All right thank you Doctor
Zimmerman".</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"Please, call me Peter, we're all friends here.
"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"I see you've been off your medication for some
weeks now, any problems ?"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"no sir"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"no more evil voices inside your head telling
you what to do ?"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"no sir"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>-"good, good. I see your behavior has improved
dramatically these last few months and I feel there is a good case
for returning you to the community"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>He leant over the desk and placed his sweaty
hand on mine, I resisted the impulse to snatch up the glass
paperweight and smash his skull in.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"And so the medical board have agreed that you
be released on condition that you do not have contact with any of
your former victims or their families, and that you stay in touch
with your psychiatrist Dr Manson. -Good luck !"...</I></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>...The sound of the heavy metal gates closing
behind me signaled the return of my freedom.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"Told you they'd fall for it ! " the voices
gloated</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"Yeah, Suckers ! " I replied.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>"... And now they're gonna pay".</I></FONT></P>
