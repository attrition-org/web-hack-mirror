Hey guys.<br>
Okay, so its Monday, my 5th defacement in 3 days.. heh, I must be bored.<br>
I kinda like this one though, kinky domain or what? :)<br><br>
&lt;RANT&gt;<br>
Okay, first up... Napster... Save it. The net should not be some .government controlled piece of shit, it should be *free* - hear me? F-R-E-E, free speech, no carinvore or echelon, now that would rock.. But, its not gunna happen. *sigh*<br>
Note to metallica: I have my eyes on your site guys, be warned, patch up or bare the consequences.<br><br>
Child Pr0n... Damn that sucks. I hate it, its just vile, man how could someone get off on watching a 4 year old being raped??!? Those guys should burn in hell for this... Anyways, props to my friend y0shi who is fighting this awful society of KP...<br>
Note to wonderland kid pr0n ring: You were named and shamed on British television, I know who you are, come near me or my family and I will knife you, ok?<br>
&lt;/RANT&gt;<br><br>
Okay, so I defaced this site to get this across, there are people out there who care guys.
<br><br>
Admin: The usual blah blah, your site was not damaged, all files backed up, I looked at no other things at all. Mail me for info...<br><br>
