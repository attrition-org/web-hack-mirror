<title>The Story Of A Boy Named Jose</title>
  <p>There was once a boy named Jose Plotts. This boy was very charming (Rated as being 84% hotter than
the average mexican male.) and lived just south of Juarez. Jose dreamed of moving north, to the land
of the fast food joints and domesticated animals, and becoming an IT professional (much like the
administrator of this server). But there was one problem; Jose was, in all actuality, in the employ of a
man named El Sochoya Deblanca Rodriguez III, the local Pesco dealer. Henceforth, we will refer to this man
as inS. Jose toiled in the pesco mines from the crack of dawn til well after sunset every day, dreaming of
the day when he would finally be free. But inS was stubborn and refused to let him go. One night, Jose
heard a tapping on his window. Naturally, his first thought was "Oh shit orbflux and downkaos have come to
fuck my buns what will I do?" so he hid, he hid in the only place where a boy can hide when he lives in
the inS' house. He hid in the buns of Eltopo. Eltopo was a kind, benevolent man at times, but sometimes he
would listen to Rage Against The Machine and kick/ban innocent people. Regardless, while Jose sat there,
nestled deeply in the buns of Eltopo, he heard the strangest thing...the call of El Timbo. El Timbo was
Jose's brother, a man who truly walked the path of the golden bean, and was believed to have been killed
in the mines of Elchista De Hoya during. Jose gasped and emerged from the sweaty buns of Eltopo and
embraced his lost brother. Eltimbo whispered in Jose's ear, "Jose, I have come to take you to America
and teach you the ways of Unix and hot cocks." Jose gasped and ran into the sunset with his long lost
brother...</p>

last but not least - DownKaos, I'm going to fucking kill you =D.
