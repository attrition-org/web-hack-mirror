<p align="left"><font face="Courier New"><small><font color="#00FF00">The
struggle of the people of</font> <font color="#FF0000">Kashmir</font> for their
rights has entered the final phase. They have waited for forty long years
pinning their hope on India's &quot;good&quot; conscience. They got only
promises but no fulfillment. They counted on Pakistan's ability to pressurize
India<br>
into doing justice to them. It did not happen. They put their trust in the
United Nations. It only passed resolutions for holding a fair and impartial plebiscite. They
found that with each passing year, India became more obdurate, more defiant and
became bold enough to declare that Kashmir was an integral part of it. They find
the tide of Hindu fundamentalism is India rising to a vicious crescendo. It has
come to hold the levers of power in India at the center and in the states. It
has already pushed the government into substantially eroding Kashmir's special
status in the Indian union, guaranteed by Article 370 of the Constitution. It is
now pitching for the abrogation of the Article itself. Communal riots, killing
of Muslims and economic discrimination have become endemic. The people of
Kashmir have decided to wage their own war of freedom. Hatred begets hatred;
Occupation begets resistance. It is only a natural phenomenon.<br>
