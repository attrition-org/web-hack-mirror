Heh - admin, nothing deleted, you will find your old index back up easily enough. You have some cool pics on this box, but I decided against 'stealing' some of them, just don't store customers info insecurely on your server... I found stuff like this:<br><br><font size=4><pre>

I recently saw your defacement protesting "Save Napster", and free software without governemental control. Amen to that. However, one thing that urks me about Napster. I've been in the .mp3 scene for over 4 years now, and Napster didn't exist prior to 1999. Yet, everyone jumps on the free-Napster bandwagon when it gets shut down. Did anyone have any derision against the BSA, RIAA, FBI, and all the governmental and anti-piracy agencies that constantly took down mp3-warez file servers across the world? I know over 100 people that have been raided and imprisoned for freely distributing .mp3s (and software alike) to the masses -- and even sued by record companies and artists on top of other punishments. Yet, they get no one protesting in their favor? No web defacements? But a big media giant like Napster has the fanfare whom deface web sites with a "free napster" slogan, not just once, but thousands of times! I think it's awesome how people are unifying to save Napster, but what a!
bout the little people who helped spawn the creation of Napster? Most of them are currently in federal/state prisons serving sentences or on the streets because they couldn't pay the 2 million dollar lawsuit. Instead of "keep Napster free", I say "free all the people who helped start the mp3 generation". Thats all ;) 
</i><br><br>I fully agree with that, its the lil' things in life that help for the rest of us, those guys have sacrificed 5 years of their life for our mp3 @fserve leeching =)
