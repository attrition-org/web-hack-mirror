Hi kids,<br>
<br>
here goes a special /msg to guys @ sm0ked crew: Well guys, you really make me laugh. Shit, don't get me wrong, 'coz I don't have anyhing against you, but why are you guys so fuckin' arrogant? Ok, recently you defaced some high-profile web servers, you get lots of chicks, fanmail and shit...but what the fuck? Those servers were all IIS and any 6yr kid can deface IIS with Unicode or RDS. Even my grandmom did it few times...Why don't you just enjoy your 5 minutes of fame and spare us from your bullshit talk. Oh, so you want to be sysadmins...hahahaha...<br>and you think defacing few servers just makes you an admin? I suppose you know all about c, perl, asp, php, sql, tcp/ip,..or maybe you thought that all that sysadmin got to do is applying patches from Microsoft? Oh and btw, you are NOT hackers at all!! Sorry to disapoint you guys, but you are not even close to that status. Real hackers can code their own exploits (not just use some well known scripts) and most impotrant: <u>real hackers don't deface web servers</u>, script kiddies do that.<br>
<br>
Well guys, gotta go. It was my pleasure talking to you...and btw, I'm not a hacker neither. I am just an ordinary script kiddie, just like you guys are, except that I admit this fact...<br>
<br>
./exceed<br>
