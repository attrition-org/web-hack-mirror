<b>C</b>an you tell me what gives you the right<br>
To let us live part of a life and then deny<br>
To give us hope, to let us see the light<br>
Then let it fade away and die ?
</p><p><b>
A</b>nswer me then, you coward in disguise<br>
You steel away our life, in front of our eyes<br>
You make us feel safe and then you return<br>
Like fire you destroy, you make our life burn
</p><p><b>
N</b>ow in a fog, we can't see the light<br>
Theres nothing to wish for but to fade away and die<br>
We pray that it comes, release us from the sight<br>
Of our deteriorating bodies, becoming no more than a shell<br>
Of our former selves we used to know so well
</p><p><b>
C</b>ant you remove us take us from this hell<br>
Away from everything we used to know so well<br>
This is not living we don't want to live in this state<br>
To see our family grieve, this we really hate
</p><p><b>
E</b>verything depends on you, let me go, let me be free<br>
Release your grip, don't hold on to my life<br>
I have nothing left, you have all of me<br>
My friends, my family I don't wish them to see
</p><p><b>
R</b>ot, decay, myself no more<br>
Please stop kicking at my door<br>
Go away leave me alone, release me to my death<br>
I don't want to live like this any more<br>
I do not have the strength</p>
