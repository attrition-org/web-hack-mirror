<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial Black"><STRONG>International Hunger Facts</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial Black">About 24,000 people die every day from hunger or hunger-related
causes. This is down from 35,000 ten years ago, and 41,000 twenty
years ago. Three-fourths of the deaths are children under the age of
five. <EM>The Hunger Project, United Nations</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Today 10% of children in developing countries die before the age of
five. This is down from 28% fifty years ago. <EM>CARE</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Famine and wars cause just 10% of hunger deaths, although these
tend to be the ones you hear about most often. The majority of hunger
deaths are caused by chronic malnutrition. Families simply cannot get
enough to eat. This in turn is caused by extreme poverty. <EM>The Institute
for Food and Development Policy</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Besides death, chronic malnutrition also causes impaired vision,
listlessness, stunted growth and greatly increased susceptibility to
disease. Severely malnourished people are unable to function at even
a basic level. <EM>United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">It is estimated that some 800 million people in the world suffer from
hunger and malnutrition, about 100 times as many as those who
actually die from it each year. <EM>Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO)</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">According to the 1996 World Food Summit, 840 million people live in
the condition of chronic, persistent hunger, one-seventh of our human
family. The vast majority of hungry people live in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Often it takes just a few simple resources for impoverished people to
be able to grow enough food to become self-sufficient. These
resources include quality seeds, appropriate tools and access to
water. Small improvements in farming techniques and food storage
methods are also helpful. <EM>Oxfam</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Many hunger experts believe that ultimately the best way to reduce
hunger is through education. Educated people are best able to break
out of the cycle of poverty that causes hunger. <EM>United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF)</EM></FONT></P>
