<td BGCOLOR="#FFCCCC">If you are new to hackme, the way it works is this.
You try to hack into the hackme server, make it crash, change it's contents
or violate its security in some detectable way. Then you email me, <a href="mailto:hacker@hackme.com">hacker@hackme.com</a>
and tell me what you succeeded in doing. If you were in fact successful
in hacking hackme, you win something. The prize is usually a T shirt and
an email forward from hackme.com domain. From time to time we will have
a hardware manufacturer provide a more enticing reward like a laptop or
even cash.
<p>Prior to hacking hackme you may want to email me and tell me what you
are going to do so I can know for certain it was you that did it. You register
by sending your email address and the IP block or domain you will likely
be hacking from to hacker@hackme.com.</td>
