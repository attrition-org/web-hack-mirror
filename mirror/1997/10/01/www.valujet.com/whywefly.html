<font size="-1"><b>Letter from D. Joseph Corr, <br>
President and Chief Executive Officer, AirTran Airlines.</b><p>

I'm a pilot.  I love to fly.<p>

I joined the airline known as ValuJet about a year ago.  Previously, I was president of Continental Airlines and Trans World Airlines.  Everybody knew changes would have to be made at ValuJet.  Changes in safety procedures, operations, customer service, h
ow we handle reservations.  Some big changes and lots of little ones.  The changes are part of our commitment to provide a very enjoyable travel experience for a very affordable fare.<p>

One dramatic change is that Atlanta-based ValuJet is merging with Orlando-based AirTran Airways.  The new airline will have a fleet of 50 aircraft serving 45 cities and will enable us to better compete against larger airlines.  That's important, because w
hen we enter a market, bigger airlines lower their fares to compete with us.  But these days, anybody can cut prices.  We want to accomplish something more.<p>

Our mission is to deliver affordable, convenient, safe, reliable air transportation to business and leisure travelers.  To fulfill this mission, we needed to bring two airlines together to create a new one.  More than 2,800 dedicated employees are working
 hard to make this new airline a success, and satisfy our customers.  Our new airline includes product enhancements designed to make air travel a more enjoyable and convenient experience.  Customers will soon be able to enjoy our new business class seatin
g, pre-assigned seating and access to our affordable fares through travel agents.<p>

When I'm not flying my own plane, I'm traveling as a passenger on AirTran.  Or I'm trying our competitors to see how our service stacks up to theirs.<p>

Over the last year, we've done pretty well, based on the way experts measure airline performance.  The report card (which follows my letter) shows we're among the best in on-time flight arrivals, baggage delivery, and percentage of completed flights.  The
 airline's performance this year is an untold story.  While we are dedicated to continuing our excellent performance, we're also committed to doing a better job of telling you about it.<p>

I can promise that our customers will always be able to count on us for affordable fares everywhere we fly.  And they can always expect a whole lot more.  We are dedicated to raising the world's expectations about how enjoyable affordable air travel can b
e.  I invite you to see for yourself.<p>

Cordially,<p>

D. Joseph Corr<br>
President and Chief Executive Officer</font><p>
