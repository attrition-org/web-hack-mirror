The information here will be constantly updated.<p>The Conservative Party claim that every breakthrough in communications technology this century has started under Conservative Governments: the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, local radio, mobile phones, satellite television.<P>So it is not surprising that Britain already has more people connected to the Internet than any other country in Europe.<P>And that it was not the State that created the Internet. It was millions of individuals, just like you.<BR><P>While this information may or may not be true, let's get the facts straight.  These breakthrough's in communication technology has nothing at all to do with conservative's being in power.  They've been in power so long what do you expect, and as for the internet thing, too right it wasn't created by the state, but it wasn't created by millions of people just like me either.  So many people in Britain don't voice their opinions, but I do, and this is the only way I can do it, or of course using the IRA method of blowing people up.  But even still, is it at all worth it, trying to be heard?  Because do you actually listen to the people any way because it sure doesn't seem that way!  I am a hacker, and I am starting where the Labour hacker left off a couple of weeks ago.  As he, who ever he was said, we, the people of Britain are putting our country in the hands of these parties, who can't even secure a web page, so how do we expect them to run a country?  You would have thought that after The Labour Parties web page was hacked then the politicians might have learn't from their mistakes, but have they?  Obviously not seeing as another Party's page has now been hacked.  It wouldn't be so bad if it were for the fact that politicians learnt from their mistakes, but they don't which is being illustrated here, they make a mistake and completely ignore it and don't learn a thing, and these are the people who are running our country.<BR><IMG SRC="mepfbut.gif" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=200 align=middle BORDER=0><P>And this European thing that we seem to be getting into right now, I haven't got a clue why the government want to join, what's in it for them because there certainly isn't anything in it for the country, one parliament, one government, 1 flag, one anthem and, no more Britain, just the country Federal Europe.  And the German chancellor Coal has already stated that within 2 years2the process of integration will be made, irreversible".  And bare in mind that that means for ever, not just during our lives, but our children's lives and our children's children's lives, so the one mistake that could be made now, could be one of the biggest mistakes in Britain's history.  Now no offence to germany but we won the war and now they are taking over control of our country again, but this time we aren't winning the fight and we are being taken over, not necessarily just by germany, but by a whole group of politicians including ours from many different countries who just want to expand their power.  <p>The government are currently keeping the truth from us, just like they did when they took us into Europe in the first place.  At the moment we have the power to make our own laws, the power to run our economy to create jobs and security for our people, the power to decide foreign policy, to have our own border and to organize our own security.  The first two of these have already been taken away from us by the tories, but if this whole integrating process takes place we will lose them all.  During 1994, averaged out there were 129 new laws imposed every week because of the fact that we don't make our own laws anymore. By the end of this century there may no longer be a Britain on the map.  If the government cared for britain would they be doing this too us?<IMG SRC="wmhead.gif" ALIGN=middle WIDTH=448 HEIGHT=60 BORDER=0><p>Now the indervidual political perties have started their munafestoes claiming how great they would be if their party was elected.  And if you remember back to the last time this happend, you will notice that the same things they said last time, they are saying again, and did they do what they promised last time? NO.  Wouldn't it make much more sence just to say what they WILL and CAN do rather than talk complete and utter shite which is what they have done the rest of their lives. If they told the truth in what they want to acheive they would gain the respect the citizens and thus votes rather than, okay, telling us what we want to hear but with no intension of doing it.<p>When it comes to trying to win votes, apart from talking as much shite as physically possible, they like to stab each other in the back with things that they have done in the past.  The Conservatives are always talking about how high tax and unemployment was when Labour were in power and how low it is now.  But have you noticed that the Labour party aren't even the same party as before?  They have different goals now, and completely different members.  Labour like talking about "A vote for the liberal democrats is as good as securing power for the conservatives for another 5 years".  Well, that may be or may not be true, but all their trying to do is get the Liberal Democrat voters to vote Labour instead.  Why do the parties do this back stabbing.  We remember what has happened in the past, we were there, just like you were.  Why don't you just let the past go and get back to the present, the situation now.<p>One last thing before I go, here are the words of The Mentor, who I think puts things into perspective very well...<p><B>Another one got caught today, it's all over the news papers.  "Teenager Arrested In Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested After bank Tampering"...Damn kids.  They're all alike.  But did you, in your three piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have moulded him?  I am a hacker, enter my world...  Mine is a world that beginns with school...  I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.  I'm in joiner high of high school.  I've listened to the teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my working.  I did it in my head..."  Damn kid, probably coppied it.  They're all alike. I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a minute this is cool.  It does what I want it to do.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up, not because it doesn't like for... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I'ma smart ass... Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...<BR><p>Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.  And then it happened... A door opened to a world... rushing through my phone line like heroin through an addicts vain, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.  "This is it, this is where I belong".  I know everyone here, even if i've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again...  I know you all... Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...  You bet your ass we're all alike.  We've been fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak...  The bits of meat that you did let through were pre-chewed and tastless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach us found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in a desert.<BR><p>This is our world now...  The worlds of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the board.  We make use of a source already existing without paying for something that could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin colour, without nationality, without religious base... and you call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.<p>Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.  My crime is that of out smarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.  I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individuals, but you can't stop us all... After all, we're all alike.<br><P>I hope you enjoy surfing our pages.</B><tr><td><IMG src=signatur.gif WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=82><td/><tr/></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"> <FONT SIZE="5"> <b><b><p>THIS PAGE HAS BEEN HACKED BY: CIRCLE OF DECEPTION<FONT SIZE="1"><B><B><P>(c) Conservative's Hacked Central Office, 32 Smith Square, Westminster, London  SW1P 3HH<BR> Phone: 0171 222 9000    Fax: 0171 222 8578<BR><FONT SIZE="2">Designed in a hacked version of webedit.</TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
