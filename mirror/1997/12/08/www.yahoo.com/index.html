<B><FONT SIZE=+2>For the past month, anyone who has viewed Yahoo's
page &amp; used their search engine, now has a logic bomb/worm implanted
deep within their computer.</FONT></B>
<br><br>
The worm part of this 'virus,' (in layman's terms) spreads itself
across internal networks that the infected machine is on.
<br><br>
<B>Binary programs are also infected.</B>
<br><br>
<FONT SIZE=+2>On Christmas Day, 1997, the logic bomb part of this
'virus,' will become active, wreaking havoc upon the entire planet's networks.</FONT>
<br><br>
The virus can be stopped.
<br><br>
But not by mortals.
<br><br>
An antidote program has been written.
<br><br>
This program is resting somewhere on a computer in the southeastern
hemisphere.
<br><br>
<U><FONT SIZE=+2>The U.S. government will be notified of the precise
location of the antidote program upon the immediate release of Kevin Mitnick.</FONT></U>
<br><br>
In the meantime, it would be a wise move on the part of the children
of corporate and militant America to remove all money they have in any
financial institutions. One of the many functions of our virus is that
it will cause an acceleration of clocks to the year 2000.
<br><br>
The PANTS/HAGIS alliance has taken control of the world's computers.
We own everyone, and everything. No one is safe. No computer is safe.
<br><br>
Our goal, which we have achieved, is world domination.
<br><br>
The Fail Safe: [From H4G1S, PANTS, and the MLF]
<br><br>
<br><br>



On February 14 1995, Kevin David Mitnick was incarcerated for the
sole purpose of furthering the egomaniacal agenda of the United States
secret service (cervix), and the self aggrandizement of both would be "security
expert" Shimomura and has-been media lackey John Markoff.
<br><br>
To commemorate this date and further etch our outrage into the
hearts and minds of corporate and militant America, we have built in a
fail safe:
<br><br>
On exactly 01:00 hours February 14, 1997 there will be a nationwide
failure of powergrids in strategic locations. Remember, this will only
occur if Kevin David Mitnick is not released and exonerated of all
trumped up charges made against him.
<br><br>


<br><br>
And now, a note from PANTS:
<br><br>
Kevin Mitnick was wrongly jailed for a crime he did not commit.
Everyone is well aware of the fact that Mitnick was *not* behind the attack
on Shimomura's computers. Tsutomu Shimomura is a hypocrite, who is out
to make a fast buck &amp; a name for himself. Throughout the entire course
of his &amp; John Markoff's lame excuse for a book, he trashes Mitnick's
mocks him for 'not having a life.'
<br><br>
<B><U>He makes no mention, however, of his own illicit activities
with cellular phones.</U></B>
<br><br>

Mitnick did what he did out of intellectual curiosity, without
compromising the hacker ethic. The goal of Shimomura's activity, however,
was merely to listen in on other people's conversations. If Mitnick doesn't
have a life or ethics for checking someone's email for reasons of self
preservation... then what does that say about Shimomura, who eavesdrops
on unknowing victims for recreation?
<br><br>

Shimomura also constantly slams hackers as being 'clueless,' and
'ankle-biters.'
<br><br>

"h3y m1zt3r s3kUr1ty 3xp3rt.. 1ph y00'r3 s0 el8, h0w k0m3 u'r3 alw4yz
g3tt1ng 0wn3d by u$ 4nkl3b1t3rz?"
<br><br>

Tsutomu is a puppet of an increasingly Orwellian government.
He is owned by PANTS &amp; H4G1S. (Not to mention
quite a few other individuals, who shall remain nameless.)
<br><br>

The media hails Tsutomu Shimomura as "cyberspace's top cop."
<br><br>

The media forgets that the policemen of cyberspace are no different
than their analog world counterparts. Which is to say, 99% of the time,
they're completely fucking retarded and inept.
<br><br>

After being incarcerated, Mitnick's rights were continually
violated. (As they have been in the past. Refer to Jonathan Littmann's
"The Fugitive Game."). Ridiculous things ranging from not being allowed
to use the phone (h3 m1ght wh1$tl3 th3 l4Unch k0d3z &amp; st4rt w0rld w4r
3!@$) to being put in solitary confinement because the prison officials
believed he could turn his walkman radio into a device with which he could
tap their offices. However, not having access to any sort of soldering
equipment, and the fact that being a prisoner means HE IS IN A CELL ALL
DAY, this would obviously be quite impossible. He is also prohibited from
using a computer to assist him in researching for his case, despite the
fact that the library computer is not connected to a phone line, or with
the outside world in any other way. This limitation makes the task of defending
himself nearly impossible, which is exactly what they want.
<br><Br>
The EFF has, of course, stepped in with their own hypocritical
two cents ("Mitnick is an electronic miscreant," etc, etc). This is no
different from their actions in the past.. however, we expected better
from the supposedly libertarian John Perry Barlow. Shows what happens when
you listen to the government &amp; the popular media, I guess...
<br><Br>
<B>"You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself
a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about repeating
the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the struggle for independence."</B>
