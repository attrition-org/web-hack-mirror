In May 1995, the 5 nuclear weapons states - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, pledged to<BR>
"exercise utmost restraint" in nuclear testing. That commitment was made to 173 other countries at the Nuclear<BR>
Non-Proliferation (NPT) conference in New York. <BR>

Unfortunately, 3 days later, China tested a nuclear weapon underground at Lop Nor, and another in August. In early<BR>
September, France tested a nuclear weapon in the South Pacific, leading to world protests and a decline in sales of French<BR>
products abroad. Both countries plan more nuclear tests in 1995. <BR>

In the past atmospheric testing released radioactive fall- out contaminating people in many countries. Underground testing can<BR>
also cause unplanned radioactive releases, even more damaging to the environment. <BR>

Considering safety of the people, if China continues nuclear testing, other Asian nations may use this as an excuse to also<BR>
demand the right to develop their own nuclear weapons. <BR>

The Chinese people rightly hope for a world free from the terror of nuclear war. But every nuclear explosion renews the cloud<BR>
of fear that has plagued two generations around the globe. <BR>

Today, the real sign of power is to renounce weapons of mass destruction. <BR>
