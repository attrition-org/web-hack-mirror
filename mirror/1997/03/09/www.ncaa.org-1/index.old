Has anyone noticed that those "investigators" took down
http://www.duke.edu/~jwk3/ncaa-spoof/ ?  Did anyone manage to get a copy
first?

All the posturing this has incited disgusts me.  First B.K. DeLong (Home
phone# (413) 253-5699) wrote a very self-aggrandizing post about how he &
his friend "spent from 9pm-1am EST tracking these hackers down." and "This
morning I wrote a report on mine and Jay's findings and e-mailed it to
Wally Renfro, NCAA Webmaster."  He also claims that "The Chronicle of
Higher Ed.  will be running a story in its next issue explaining the
process Jay and I went through.  ESPN ran something this morning as did
the LA Times and Orlando Sentinel."  We have all seen such publicity
hounding hacker chasing wannabees before, but at least Shimomura's chase
involved moderately sophisticated techniques against a decent hacker. This
guy (B.K.) seems to think he is some sort of hero for tracking down people
he *thinks* are in the group *mentioned in the hacked page*. 

If anyone saw the page, you know that it was *not* a brilliant, well
thought out scheme by a group of computer geniuses.  These guys couldn't
spell, much less understand English grammer!  They just put up a .gif of
their Group's name, greets to their friends, and talk about their favorite
IRC channels!  They also had a link to their "ereet Guess Book" which was
a free canned guestbook page from dreambook.com.  To give you a final
idea of the skill level of these "hackers", the page was created with
Microsoft FrontPage 2.0.

Yet NCAA spokeswoman Kathryn Reith said Monday that "Clearly, these were
very sophisticated hackers".  Hello Kathryn!!  They showed nothing but
utter incompetence, and I would seriously doubt they are older than 12. 
I'll bet the "investigation" B.K. is so proud of involved nothing more
than logging onto the irc channel mentioned (#bor) and finding the people
mentioned (Krista, presley,etc) bragging about the hack.  He might have
then used an elite computer security technique known as '/who' to
determine their aol addresses. 

Sorry for this rant, but it just pisses me off that these guys (DeLong et
all.) are almost certainly going to get all the media attention they are
begging for.  And the media will surely buy into it completely!  They will
write that this is exactly what "very sophisticated hackers" go around
doing.  Thank god Mr. DeLong came and saved the day from these "hackers". 
I didn't see the LA times or Orlando Sentinel articles, but I doubt they
painted the true picture of WANNABE hacker miscreants defacing the NCAA
page with racist garbage to get attention. 

Cheers,
Fyodor
