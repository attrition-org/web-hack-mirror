'*aget*' is a utility designed by attrition.org staff to mirror web
page defacements. this is an evolving utility that goes several steps
beyond simple mirrors.

Thanks to:
 * Munge - excellent shell-fu, debugging, optimizing and more
 * Punkis - debugging, testing
 * Mcintyre - couple feature ideas, a little testing
 * Marcus Manning - idea to mail country based CERT

thanks to snowcrash (.woeM) for occasionally sitting in my lap while i work
thanks to the pacific ocean and 7 hours with no laptop for brainstorming
a bulk of the features of this beast (herro Tokyo)

for all features, you must have Nmap and Jwhois installed!
